## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(xlsx)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)

Joia <- read_excel("AFPNNE.xlsx")
Joia <- Joia[-1,]
Joia$`Cost Member`
Joia %>% 
    as_data_frame(.) %>% 
    arrange(Location,Date,desc(`Cost Member`)) %>% 
    select(Location,Date,everything()) %>% 
    write.csv(., file = "joias_work.csv")
    kable(.)
