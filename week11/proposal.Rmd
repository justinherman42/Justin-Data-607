### Data Preparation

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)

sports <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/nfl-fandom/NFL_fandom_data-google_trends.csv",skip=1,header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE )

## Data Cleanup- remove % symbol, convert cols to numeric
sports2 <- as_data_frame(lapply(sports, gsub, pattern='\\%', replacement=''))
sports_names <- colnames(sports2)[-1]
sports2[sports_names] <- sapply(sports2[sports_names],as.numeric)
sports_names
## get the means of sports categories
team_means <- lapply(sports2[sports_names],mean)
## get sd of categories
col_sd <- sapply(sports2[sports_names], sd, na.rm = TRUE)
col_sd



```


### Research question 

+ Do higher or lower percantages by which people search for the 7 major sports, effect Trumps approval rating.  

### Cases 

- The towns are listed by designated market area (DMA)
- 207 different cases


### Data collection 

+ "Google Trends data was derived from comparing 5-year search traffic for the 7 sports leagues we analyzed:""


### Type of study 

+ Observational


### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

[https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/nfl-fandom/NFL_fandom_data-google_trends.csv]


### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

+ Discrete numerical- Trump 2016 Vote percentage

### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**

+ Discrete numerical-  Pct. Of major sports searches


### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

```{r} 
paste("the means of column",sports_names,"is ",team_means," The sd of each column is ",col_sd)
```
## Generalizability
+ With an average Trump vote of 54.5, our sample is clearly biased(Trump lost popular vote)
    + I can show this statistically
+ As an observational Study this will not prove there is a causation between  sports searches and Trump vote  

## Several ideas for Approach
+ Use linear regression to build a possible predictive model
+ Look at each sport individually.  Possibly categorize each column by a set SD and determine if those groupings show statistically signficant differences in approval ratings.
