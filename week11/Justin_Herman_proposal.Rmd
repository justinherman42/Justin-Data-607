### Data Preparation

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)

sports <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/nfl-fandom/NFL_fandom_data-google_trends.csv",skip=1,header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE )

## Data Cleanup- remove % symbol, convert cols to numeric
sports2 <- as_data_frame(lapply(sports, gsub, pattern='\\%', replacement=''))
sports_names <- colnames(sports2)[-1]
sports2[sports_names] <- sapply(sports2[sports_names],as.numeric)
sports_names
## get the means of sports categories
team_means <- lapply(sports2[sports_names],mean)
## get sd of categories
col_sd <- sapply(sports2[sports_names], sd, na.rm = TRUE)
col_sd



```


### Research Question 

+ How does Google search results for the Seven major sports correlate to Trump's 2016 vote percentage?  

### Cases 

- The towns are listed by designated market area (DMA)
- 207 different cases


### Data Collection 

+ "Google Trends data was derived from comparing 5-year search traffic for the 7 sports leagues we analyzed:"(from github info)


### Type of study 

+ Observational


### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

[https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/nfl-fandom/NFL_fandom_data-google_trends.csv]


### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

+ Discrete numerical- Trump 2016 vote percentage

### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**

+ Discrete numerical-  Pct. of major sports searches
    + Create categorical clusters within this data based on  $\sigma$ to test if there is a difference between (higher, average, and lower sport specific searches) and  Trump's average 2016 vote 


### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

```{r} 
paste("the means of column",sports_names,"is ",team_means," The sd of each column is ",col_sd)
```
## Generalizability
+ With an average Trump vote percentage of 54.5, our sample is clearly biased(Trump lost popular vote)
    + This will be shown statistically
+ As an observational Study this will not prove there is a causation between  sports searches and Trump's 2016 vote percentage  

## Several ideas for Approach
+ Use linear regression to build a  predictive model
+ Look at each sport individually.   Categorize each sport into clusters based on $\sigma$.  I will attempt to create equal categories. I.E. (<-1.5 $\sigma$,-1 $\sigma$,-.5 $\sigma$, .5 $\sigma$,1 $\sigma$, >1.5 $\sigma$) I will use these categories to determine if there are statistically significant differences between how these clusters voted for Trump in 2016.
+ My explanatory variables are completely dependent on each other as they add up to 100% overall. Any analysis involving how multiple explanatory variables effect Trumps voting percentage, will have to find a way to account for this
