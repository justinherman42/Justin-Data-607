[4/5/17, 1:33:26 PM] Donk: Isnt there a krispy kreme in penn station?
[4/5/17, 1:33:42 PM] Donk: Thought they made them freah there?

[4/5/17, 1:36:10 PM] Donk: I didnt go out of my way for donut plant, just happen to be going to a place that was three doora down, but it was a very nice surprise

[4/5/17, 1:58:05 PM] Brian Katz: That's further than I was willing to go for donuts. How good are they?

[4/5/17, 4:10:13 PM] Brian Katz: NFL network is projecting the Giants to draft dalvin cook
[4/5/17, 4:10:23 PM] Steve: Doesn't matter
[4/5/17, 4:10:26 PM] Miller: they will not
[4/5/17, 4:10:29 PM] Donk: Would love that
[4/5/17, 4:10:41 PM] Donk: But only if all of those ot werw gone
[4/5/17, 4:10:45 PM] Steve: He won't drop to the giants
[4/5/17, 4:10:47 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah our offensive needs a better back
[4/5/17, 4:10:48 PM] Steve: So it won't matter
[4/5/17, 4:11:06 PM] Miller: they would be better off drafting engram or njoku and getting a RB later
[4/5/17, 4:11:08 PM] Donk: Unless he does drop
[4/5/17, 4:11:25 PM] Brian Katz: If cook is there gotta draft cook
[4/5/17, 4:11:27 PM] Donk: Because he wouldn't be the first player with off the field concerns to drop
[4/5/17, 4:11:28 PM] Steve: Why would the second best running back in the draft drop for no reason?
[4/5/17, 4:11:29 PM] Miller: engram should have read howard
[4/5/17, 4:11:35 PM] Steve: Do you have a smoking weed video?
[4/5/17, 4:11:36 PM] Brian Katz: I'd trade up to grab a te maybe
[4/5/17, 4:11:42 PM] Steve: Did he hit his gf/wife?
[4/5/17, 4:11:46 PM] Miller: they dont need to trade up
[4/5/17, 4:11:51 PM] Miller: cook wont be the 2nd RB taken
[4/5/17, 4:11:54 PM] Donk: Armed robbery as a kid
[4/5/17, 4:11:58 PM] Steve: If not, he won't be on the board by then
[4/5/17, 4:12:00 PM] Miller: he robbed a kid!
[4/5/17, 4:12:04 PM] Miller: with arms
[4/5/17, 4:12:21 PM] Miller: he might be on the board
[4/5/17, 4:12:27 PM] Miller: i still dont think the giants take him
[4/5/17, 4:12:30 PM] Miller: hes not even a good fit
[4/5/17, 4:12:30 PM] Brian Katz: Idk steve the NFL network who's sole purpose is to project this shit is saying they think the Giants will draft Cook, so get off my back lol
[4/5/17, 4:12:45 PM] Donk: Steve knows better than them
[4/5/17, 4:12:49 PM] Steve: I'm not even talking to you anymore
[4/5/17, 4:12:54 PM] Steve: I was talking to Donk
[4/5/17, 4:13:04 PM] Steve: Never been on your back
[4/5/17, 4:13:17 PM] Steve: I don't
[4/5/17, 4:13:21 PM] Steve: That's my opinion
[4/5/17, 4:13:25 PM] Steve: Obviously I could be wrong
[4/5/17, 4:13:30 PM] Steve: And maybe I am
[4/5/17, 4:13:45 PM] Brian Katz: You also think that Kap is starter
[4/5/17, 4:14:01 PM] Steve: I do
[4/5/17, 4:14:02 PM] Donk: He is
[4/5/17, 4:14:07 PM] Steve: And so do other people
[4/5/17, 4:14:08 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/5/17, 4:14:16 PM] Donk: Stop making me agree with steve katz
[4/5/17, 4:14:17 PM] Steve: But obviously because we don't work on NFL network
[4/5/17, 4:14:22 PM] Steve: We can't have an opinion
[4/5/17, 4:14:28 PM] Steve: Valid enough for katz
[4/5/17, 4:15:03 PM] Brian Katz: My point is Wether you believe he is a starter, he isn't
[4/5/17, 4:15:14 PM] Miller: im hopeful oj or njoku will be there
[4/5/17, 4:15:25 PM] Brian Katz: I like njoku
[4/5/17, 4:15:34 PM] Brian Katz: The U
[4/5/17, 4:15:40 PM] Steve: He was last year
[4/5/17, 4:15:53 PM] Brian Katz: That's in the past
[4/5/17, 4:15:57 PM] Steve: And he brought a team to the Super Bowl
[4/5/17, 4:16:03 PM] Brian Katz: Going forward he's out the NFL
[4/5/17, 4:16:08 PM] Donk: I think we are in good shape as one of three ots or two tes will be there
[4/5/17, 4:16:10 PM] Steve: For right now
[4/5/17, 4:16:14 PM] Brian Katz: The team brought him to the Super Bowl
[4/5/17, 4:16:28 PM] Steve: You obviously didn't watch football that season then
[4/5/17, 4:16:31 PM] Steve: Clearly
[4/5/17, 4:16:35 PM] Donk: Would be surpriswd if all 5 were off tbe board
[4/5/17, 4:16:47 PM] Steve: If you believe he was the 49ers Trent differ we have nothing to talk about
[4/5/17, 4:17:45 PM] Miller: its possible for that team to have had a great DEF (they did) and great running game (they did) and for him not to be trent dilfer
[4/5/17, 4:18:15 PM] Steve: He was very good with them
[4/5/17, 4:18:23 PM] Steve: A legitimate starting quarterback
[4/5/17, 4:18:31 PM] Steve: Who helped win games for them that season
[4/5/17, 4:18:46 PM] Brian Katz: He's not the 49ers Trent dilfer because that guy won
[4/5/17, 4:18:51 PM] Launchpad: Trent Dilfer got 2 things Tony Romo doesn't - a ring and a successful broadcast career
[4/5/17, 4:19:12 PM] Brian Katz: He's the 49ers Colin kapernick

But the only way someone from the future can come back in time is by taking over the consciousness of a present day person who is about to die.  Instead of dying, that person is given a whole new personality, while continuing to live as that person.  The Travelers are tasked with certain missions and work together in teams with other Travelers

[4/5/17, 9:12:35 PM] Miller: I dont really hate the Yankees, why did I irrationally overreact for no reason at the simple mention of my preferred baseball team? Weird
[4/5/17, 9:12:41 PM] Steve: Still think here's the Yankees more
[4/5/17, 9:12:42 PM] Miller: Def hate soccer more
[4/5/17, 9:12:53 PM] Steve: *he hates

[4/5/17, 9:14:51 PM] Miller: Braves team so fucking weird amalgam of random veterans and has beens and young prospects
[4/5/17, 9:15:11 PM] Steve: They have a ton of prospects

[4/5/17, 9:16:29 PM] Brian Katz: Well yeah he's in the heart of our line up
[4/5/17, 9:17:06 PM] Steve: I thought he's batting 2nd?
[4/5/17, 9:17:16 PM] Miller: No they have like the best farm system in baseball (the braves)
[4/5/17, 9:17:27 PM] Miller: If you include Swanson and ender
[4/5/17, 9:17:29 PM] Steve: So they all are in the minors
[4/5/17, 9:17:36 PM] Steve: Thought they'd have them up
[4/5/17, 9:17:45 PM] Miller: Some are some aren't

[4/5/17, 9:18:53 PM] Miller: Lol at reading a magazine
[4/5/17, 9:18:59 PM] Miller: What is it 1998
[4/5/17, 9:19:01 PM] Steve: I thought the braves got a ton of prospects the last theee years

[4/5/17, 9:19:51 PM] Steve: It's worse than our Kevin brown trade
[4/5/17, 9:19:58 PM] Steve: That was a bad one too
[4/5/17, 9:21:14 PM] Donk: Dylan bundy crushed it tonight.  7ip, 4 hits, no walks, 8ks, 1 run
[4/5/17, 9:21:33 PM] Miller: King Kong Bundy?
[4/5/17, 9:21:51 PM] Donk: Hopefully britton doesnt blow it here
[4/5/17, 9:22:55 PM] Donk: Never heard of king kong bundy
[4/5/17, 9:23:06 PM] Miller: Cmon
[4/5/17, 9:23:16 PM] Donk: I googled
[4/5/17, 9:23:17 PM] Brian Katz: He killed Fienberg tonight mwah hahaha
[4/5/17, 9:23:20 PM] Steve: It's the deep internet
[4/5/17, 9:23:31 PM] Donk: No recollection
[4/5/17, 9:23:35 PM] Miller: @16318489683 you know about King Kong Bundy?
[4/5/17, 9:24:50 PM] Brian Katz: He's on my fantasy team, or you talking about the old wrestler
[4/5/17, 9:25:04 PM] Miller: The latter
[4/5/17, 9:25:12 PM] Miller: I dont think this one actually has that nickname
[4/5/17, 9:25:24 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah man fought hogan in Wrestlemania two
[4/5/17, 9:25:45 PM] Miller: Yes he did, nicely done
[4/5/17, 9:26:46 PM] Steve: Katz' forte: wrestling and podcasts
[4/5/17, 9:28:22 PM] Brian Katz: I have others
[4/5/17, 9:30:54 PM] Miller: üñ®
[4/5/17, 9:31:28 PM] Steve: And zlatan Ibrahimovic
[4/5/17, 9:33:02 PM] Donk: Well britton had to load the bases with 1 out, but double play and the o's remain undefeated
[4/5/17, 9:33:29 PM] Miller: He's been a smidge shaky so far, by his standards
[4/5/17, 9:33:44 PM] Donk: Agreed, but its early
[4/5/17, 9:33:55 PM] Donk: Got the job done
[4/5/17, 9:36:44 PM] Steve: Someone posted that meme?
[4/5/17, 9:36:46 PM] Steve: Crazy
[4/5/17, 9:37:14 PM] Steve: Never happened
[4/5/17, 9:37:17 PM] Steve: Fake news
[4/5/17, 9:38:19 PM] Steve: That's an even better handle
[4/5/17, 9:52:27 PM] Brian Katz: Damn thats decent
[4/5/17, 9:52:34 PM] Steve: Hate sea salt
[4/5/17, 9:52:42 PM] Miller: Who hates sea salt
[4/5/17, 9:52:45 PM] Miller: Love the sea salt
[4/5/17, 9:52:49 PM] Steve: Me
[4/5/17, 9:53:06 PM] Steve: Too chunky
[4/5/17, 9:53:06 PM] Miller: Well they have 15 other flavors
[4/5/17, 9:53:31 PM] Miller: And there's no actual chunks of salt in here
[4/5/17, 9:53:34 PM] Steve: And it tastes weird
[4/5/17, 9:53:38 PM] Steve: I get that
[4/5/17, 9:53:46 PM] Steve: I meant that in general
[4/5/17, 9:54:53 PM] Miller: This place in Brooklyn makes these sea salt chocolate chip cookies that are the üêêcookie
[4/5/17, 9:55:12 PM] Steve: Just threw up a little in my mouth
[4/5/17, 9:56:28 PM] Miller: About to put some on my chicken
[4/5/17, 9:56:32 PM] Steve: Urgh
[4/5/17, 9:57:13 PM] Steve: It's the same feeling you get from white condiments
[4/5/17, 9:58:27 PM] Brian Katz: It's just salty
[4/5/17, 9:58:33 PM] Brian Katz: Salt*
[4/5/17, 10:00:43 PM] Scott: Sea salt is bawce
[4/5/17, 10:18:34 PM] Launchpad: cant go wrong with sea salt, truffle salt, or pink Himalayan

[4/6/17, 8:16:37 AM] Dan Watts: Cormier is big time

[4/6/17, 8:36:19 AM] Steve: #sexwithmanywomenproblems
[4/6/17, 8:36:46 AM] Dan Watts: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[4/6/17, 8:37:02 AM] Dan Watts: Not enough @ the moment tbh
[4/6/17, 8:58:38 AM] Brian Katz: I'll go back to my crib for the main event unless everyone's cool with staying.
[4/6/17, 9:01:17 AM] Miller: does bww charge a cover
[4/6/17, 9:09:25 AM] Brian Katz: Idk, never went there for a fight. If they do then forget that, I'll just get food at my crib
[4/6/17, 9:09:58 AM] Kiyoon: the ones here don't I've gone there for a fight
[4/6/17, 9:10:01 AM] Kiyoon: gets real packed though
[4/6/17, 9:10:39 AM] Kiyoon: so are you going to B dubs to watch the undercards and then order the PPV just for Cormier?
[4/6/17, 9:55:33 AM] Justin: miller how you not post picture salt bae that chicken
[4/6/17, 9:59:58 AM] Kiyoon: Watts who'd you go with for the Mastesr?
[4/6/17, 10:00:56 AM] Miller: @16316620763 what was that?
[4/6/17, 10:25:56 AM] Dan Watts: I played myself
[4/6/17, 10:26:07 AM] Dan Watts: Didn't realize they t off @ 6am
[4/6/17, 10:26:24 AM] Dan Watts: Tried getting it in this morning and was blocked
[4/6/17, 10:27:01 AM] Dan Watts: All good tho, more disposable cash for draft kings mma this weekend
[4/6/17, 10:36:16 AM] Launchpad: #sexwithnotenoughwomenproblems
[4/6/17, 10:37:55 AM] Steve: Too long
[4/6/17, 10:42:07 AM] Brian Katz: @16195657200 #what?
[4/6/17, 10:43:45 AM] Launchpad: it was a reference to Steve's hashtag at 5:36 AM PDT, #sexwithmanywomenproblems
[4/6/17, 10:44:52 AM] Launchpad: Watts responded not enough at the moment, which has become evidently clear as he was playing with himself this morning instead of betting on the Masters
[4/6/17, 10:45:37 AM] Brian Katz: Who bets on the masters?
[4/6/17, 10:45:59 AM] Brian Katz: It's golf, just take a Sunday afternoon nap to it
[4/6/17, 10:47:34 AM] Kiyoon: a lot of people bet on the masters
[4/6/17, 10:48:53 AM] Brian Katz: Is it any fun?
[4/6/17, 10:49:22 AM] Brian Katz: I'd rather just go play golf and watch the highlights of the masters before I go to bed
[4/6/17, 10:54:37 AM] Miller: or even better is play golf and dont watch the masters highlights
[4/6/17, 10:57:49 AM] Dan Watts: Golden tee is fun
[4/6/17, 11:00:50 AM] Scott: u tell us?
[4/6/17, 11:01:33 AM] Launchpad: Golden tee is the shit
[4/6/17, 11:05:28 AM] Kiyoon: would anyone consider this an ace?
[4/6/17, 11:06:12 AM] Dan Watts: No
[4/6/17, 11:06:21 AM] Steve: Good number 2-3 starter
[4/6/17, 11:06:36 AM] Donk: High end 2 on a vad team probably
[4/6/17, 11:06:36 AM] Steve: Especially if it's in the AL east
[4/6/17, 11:07:07 AM] Donk: Good era and whip
[4/6/17, 11:09:30 AM] Miller: yea solid #2, high end #2 in AL
[4/6/17, 11:12:18 AM] Miller: if youre thinking about it in terms of what hes worth in a trade you also have to take into account he is signed to a very reasonable contract for 4 more years i think
[4/6/17, 11:12:47 AM] Steve: Who is it?
[4/6/17, 11:13:02 AM] Miller: jose quintana
[4/6/17, 11:13:50 AM] Steve: Also helps that he is 27, a lefty and has gotten better statistically every year
[4/6/17, 11:14:12 AM] Kiyoon: but would you consider him an ace because he is the #1 starter
[4/6/17, 11:14:48 AM] Miller: no, ive had this same conversation 100x
[4/6/17, 11:14:56 AM] Steve: I'd consider him a very very good pitcher
[4/6/17, 11:15:01 AM] Miller: a relative based ranking system is inherently the dumbest thing ever
[4/6/17, 11:15:05 AM] Steve: Who I think the Yankees should trade for lol
[4/6/17, 11:15:06 AM] Miller: is ricky nolasco an ace?
[4/6/17, 11:15:11 AM] Miller: who cares
[4/6/17, 11:15:12 AM] Kiyoon: lolz
[4/6/17, 11:15:31 AM] Miller: the mets 5th SP is better than anyone on LAA
[4/6/17, 11:15:37 AM] Kiyoon: exactly
[4/6/17, 11:15:55 AM] Miller: i would ask who would possibly argue the opposite
[4/6/17, 11:16:12 AM] Miller: but this debate started b/c steve was judging prospects last yr based on their rankings w/in that team
[4/6/17, 11:16:14 AM] Miller: so who knows
[4/6/17, 11:16:28 AM] Steve: Nope
[4/6/17, 11:16:31 AM] Steve: That didn't happen
[4/6/17, 11:17:07 AM] Steve: I just believe those rankings matter in some cases also
[4/6/17, 11:18:05 AM] Steve: Like if I trade for pretty much anyone's number 1 prospect, I'm getting a good talent in return
[4/6/17, 11:18:14 AM] Steve: You can copy and paste all you want
[4/6/17, 11:18:17 AM] Steve: I know what I said
[4/6/17, 11:18:18 AM] Miller: false
[4/6/17, 11:18:21 AM] Miller: literally completely false
[4/6/17, 11:18:22 AM] Steve: And I know what you read
[4/6/17, 11:18:27 AM] Steve: Not at all
[4/6/17, 11:18:34 AM] Miller: its such flawed logic
[4/6/17, 11:18:38 AM] Steve: Tell me a number 1 prospect in any organization that is bad
[4/6/17, 11:18:41 AM] Steve: Please
[4/6/17, 11:18:50 AM] Steve: Or not good
[4/6/17, 11:18:54 AM] Steve: I'll wait
[4/6/17, 11:19:04 AM] Miller: marlins
[4/6/17, 11:19:05 AM] Miller: dbacks
[4/6/17, 11:19:06 AM] Miller: angels
[4/6/17, 11:19:14 AM] Steve: You are just naming teams
[4/6/17, 11:19:20 AM] Miller: orioles
[4/6/17, 11:19:20 AM] Steve: Give me names and stats
[4/6/17, 11:19:25 AM] Miller: tigers
[4/6/17, 11:19:31 AM] Miller: sure
[4/6/17, 11:19:48 AM] Miller: http://www.baseballamerica.com/minors/2017-top-100-prospects/#lwSDPWfg8UmSZI0y.97
[4/6/17, 11:20:08 AM] Miller: angels - 0 on this list
[4/6/17, 11:20:12 AM] Miller: dbacks - 1 (#88)
[4/6/17, 11:20:21 AM] Miller: marlins - 1 (#76)
[4/6/17, 11:20:37 AM] Miller: orioles - 1 (#57)
[4/6/17, 11:20:47 AM] Miller: tigers - 1 (#61)
[4/6/17, 11:21:09 AM] Miller: the pirates 4th best prospect is
[4/6/17, 11:21:12 AM] Miller: #35
[4/6/17, 11:21:19 AM] Miller: but he is the FOURTH best prospect so he kind of sucks
[4/6/17, 11:21:24 AM] Miller: not likes hes NUMBER 1
[4/6/17, 11:21:33 AM] Brian Katz: Byron buxton sucks
[4/6/17, 11:21:46 AM] Brian Katz: Matt wieters blew dick
[4/6/17, 11:21:47 AM] Donk: This is similar to the wr1 on a given team vs an actual wr1
[4/6/17, 11:21:54 AM] Miller: or #1 SP
[4/6/17, 11:21:57 AM] Miller: vs an actual "ace"
[4/6/17, 11:22:09 AM] Miller: or ANY KIND OF RELATIVE RANKING WHICH IS A COMPLETELY FLAWED CONCEPT
[4/6/17, 11:22:31 AM] Steve: I don't care enough really to argue stupidities
[4/6/17, 11:22:34 AM] Steve: You are correct
[4/6/17, 11:22:37 AM] Steve: You always are
[4/6/17, 11:22:43 AM] Brian Katz: Austin Jackson didn't do much
[4/6/17, 11:22:44 AM] Steve: Don't care
[4/6/17, 11:23:00 AM] Steve: Thought I was just answering Kiyoon's question
[4/6/17, 11:23:15 AM] Miller: steve "nope, give me proof" 
steve "whatever i dont care anyway"
[4/6/17, 11:23:18 AM] Brian Katz: Brian matuz stink
[4/6/17, 11:23:24 AM] Steve: You didn't give me proof
[4/6/17, 11:23:31 AM] Brian Katz: Rocco baldelli stunk
[4/6/17, 11:23:33 AM] Steve: You sent baseball americas rankings
[4/6/17, 11:23:43 AM] Steve: And called it proof of an argument that you think I'm having
[4/6/17, 11:23:53 AM] Miller: the angels TOP PROSPECT not even being a top 100 prospect in baseball is not proof enough for you that he sucks?
[4/6/17, 11:24:07 AM] Steve: In sure he's awful
[4/6/17, 11:24:08 AM] Miller: sorry i mean yes he is better at baseball than me or you
[4/6/17, 11:24:09 AM] Miller: so youre right
[4/6/17, 11:24:11 AM] Miller: hes awesome
[4/6/17, 11:24:14 AM] Steve: It's my flawed system
[4/6/17, 11:24:20 AM] Launchpad: Brian Taylor üëé
[4/6/17, 11:24:40 AM] Steve: Again, I don't feel like arguing
[4/6/17, 11:24:40 AM] Brian Katz: Desmond Jennings sucked
[4/6/17, 11:24:45 AM] Steve: I have a flawed system
[4/6/17, 11:24:47 AM] Steve: You don't
[4/6/17, 11:24:49 AM] Steve: I get it
[4/6/17, 11:24:58 AM] Steve: I'm wrong
[4/6/17, 11:28:26 AM] Launchpad: http://www.espn.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/11025655/mlb-draft-rise-fall-new-york-yankees-pitcher-brien-taylor
[4/6/17, 11:28:28 AM] Launchpad: Sad
[4/6/17, 11:28:35 AM] Launchpad: In November 2012, Taylor was sentenced to 38 months in prison for distributing crack cocaine. He could not be reached for inclusion in this story.
[4/6/17, 11:30:22 AM] Dan Watts: @16313981203 I heard Dustin Johnson fucked up his back
[4/6/17, 11:34:45 AM] Kiyoon: yeah falling down the stairs
[4/6/17, 11:35:01 AM] Kiyoon: aka he was fell backwards doing lines of blow off paulinas ass
[4/6/17, 11:48:52 AM] Dan Watts: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[4/6/17, 11:50:10 AM] Dan Watts: Does anyone else think that the brioche bun is the most overrated bread product out there?
[4/6/17, 11:50:52 AM] Miller: rye is more overrated but brioche is pretty wack
[4/6/17, 11:51:28 AM] Launchpad: On the flipside, the most underrated bread product has to be the pretzel bun with salt
[4/6/17, 11:52:33 AM] Miller: pretzel buns are awesome but idk if theyre underrated
[4/6/17, 11:52:43 AM] Miller: or maybe i just have spent too much time discussing bread w/feinberg
[4/6/17, 11:56:58 AM] Kiyoon: what other sandwich do you eat on rye besides ruebens
[4/6/17, 11:57:12 AM] Miller: i only eat it on pastrami personally
[4/6/17, 11:57:15 AM] Miller: but idk ppl love rye bread
[4/6/17, 11:57:15 AM] Donk: Corn beef
[4/6/17, 11:57:34 AM] Dan Watts: Brioche sucks
[4/6/17, 11:57:44 AM] Miller: millenials love brioche
[4/6/17, 11:57:49 AM] Donk: Patty melt uses rye
[4/6/17, 11:58:00 AM] Dan Watts: Literally would prefer 2 pieces of wonder white bread
[4/6/17, 11:58:02 AM] Donk: I like some brioche depending on the sandwich
[4/6/17, 11:58:06 AM] Dan Watts: It's just air
[4/6/17, 11:58:08 AM] Miller: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/11/07/fancy-breads-buns-millennials-wendys-brioche/3454277/
[4/6/17, 11:58:12 AM] Dan Watts: Fucking brioche
[4/6/17, 11:58:31 AM] Donk: Bread being the right choice depends on the sandwich
[4/6/17, 11:59:21 AM] Donk: Pretzel bread is awesome
[4/6/17, 11:59:28 AM] Donk: But would suck for pb&j
[4/6/17, 11:59:52 AM] Dan Watts: I fuck with pretzel bread
[4/6/17, 12:00:13 PM] Dan Watts: You know what's good for a burger? A damn English muffin
[4/6/17, 12:00:45 PM] Launchpad: how often as a 32 year old man do you actually eat PB&J?
[4/6/17, 12:01:27 PM] Dan Watts: I eat pb&j all the time. Bitches love it
[4/6/17, 12:01:45 PM] Miller: never had one
[4/6/17, 12:06:51 PM] Donk: Once a month?
[4/6/17, 12:07:35 PM] Donk: I always have bread/jelly/peanut butter in my house, so if there is nothing else to eat, its a fall back
[4/6/17, 12:09:14 PM] Launchpad: well I don't know about the jelly, but Id imagine PB has to be good on a pretzel bun
[4/6/17, 12:10:52 PM] Donk: Regardless, i think the basic point still stands
[4/6/17, 12:15:29 PM] Brian Katz: Peanut butter goes with almost anything
[4/6/17, 2:31:04 PM] Steve: Hopefully @16318489683 you don't live anywhere near here: http://www.fios1news.com/longisland/2-injured-Ronkonkoma-home-shotgun-through-door-4-6-17#.WOaJSUH3aEd
[4/6/17, 2:31:31 PM] Miller: how on earth did you find that
[4/6/17, 2:35:10 PM] Kiyoon: Steve browsess long island news wishing he could have grown up there
[4/6/17, 2:35:53 PM] Steve: I worked for them for 2 1/2 years and still follow them on Facebook
[4/6/17, 2:36:15 PM] Brian Katz: I don't know where that was in relation to me, but it sounds like a crazy domestic dispute
[4/6/17, 2:36:20 PM] Steve: I don't like Long Island at all
[4/6/17, 2:37:37 PM] Brian Katz: Well that's where you live lol
[4/6/17, 2:37:43 PM] Kiyoon: not even a little Steve?
[4/6/17, 2:38:34 PM] Brian Katz: You guys see the heroine bust yesterday on 110?
[4/6/17, 2:38:55 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/6/17, 2:39:01 PM] Brian Katz: 36 people arrested
[4/6/17, 2:39:03 PM] Steve: I live in Queens
[4/6/17, 2:39:13 PM] Steve: It's a borough in NYC
[4/6/17, 2:39:32 PM] Steve: Kind of like how states that are connected by land aren't the same state?
[4/6/17, 2:39:48 PM] Launchpad: Physically located on a geographic anomaly known as Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:39:54 PM] Steve: They may be attached, but it doesn't make them the same
[4/6/17, 2:40:10 PM] Brian Katz: https://www.google.com/amp/s/patch.com/new-york/halfhollowhills/amp/27013456/heroin-ring-along-route-110-among-biggest-busts-in-li-history-officials-say
[4/6/17, 2:40:10 PM] Steve: It's not located on Long Island at all
[4/6/17, 2:40:27 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah but if Long Island sunk you'd be under water
[4/6/17, 2:40:45 PM] Steve: That also can be said about any land masses connected
[4/6/17, 2:40:58 PM] Steve: If Spain sunk, I bet you France would go down also
[4/6/17, 2:41:06 PM] Brian Katz: Sure but I'm sure people don't dispute living on main land USA
[4/6/17, 2:41:09 PM] Steve: Same with Russia and China
[4/6/17, 2:41:19 PM] Steve: Or how about Canada and the us?
[4/6/17, 2:41:34 PM] Launchpad: https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/new-york/25-things-you-don-t-understand-about-long-island
[4/6/17, 2:41:41 PM] Launchpad: 12. Brooklyn and Queens are both ON LONG ISLAND
But in all the ways that matter, they totally aren't.
[4/6/17, 2:41:48 PM] Launchpad: ^ official source
[4/6/17, 2:41:58 PM] Brian Katz: Do you pay a toll when you drive into the city?
[4/6/17, 2:42:11 PM] Steve: The thrillist? Lol
[4/6/17, 2:42:21 PM] Steve: I don't
[4/6/17, 2:42:24 PM] Steve: It's free
[4/6/17, 2:42:29 PM] Brian Katz: From where
[4/6/17, 2:42:37 PM] Steve: 59th street bridge
[4/6/17, 2:42:53 PM] Steve: And I use that every time I go
[4/6/17, 2:42:54 PM] Launchpad: Long Island is a physical location, not a geopolitical subdivision
[4/6/17, 2:43:00 PM] Brian Katz: Okay everyone has that right, but that's not the closest bridge to you
[4/6/17, 2:43:12 PM] Steve: Who cares?
[4/6/17, 2:43:13 PM] Launchpad: there is no Long Island town, city, county or government
[4/6/17, 2:43:18 PM] Launchpad: it is an island and you live on it
[4/6/17, 2:43:26 PM] Steve: So because it's not the closest bridge I must live on Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:43:31 PM] Steve: Wrong again
[4/6/17, 2:43:40 PM] Steve: I live on a peninsula
[4/6/17, 2:43:47 PM] Steve: Loner Island is an island
[4/6/17, 2:43:52 PM] Brian Katz: You live on Long Island because that's the land mass you rest your bones on
[4/6/17, 2:43:58 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/6/17, 2:44:01 PM] Steve: I'm in queens
[4/6/17, 2:44:06 PM] Steve: A borough of New York City
[4/6/17, 2:44:13 PM] Brian Katz: You by no means live on a peninsula
[4/6/17, 2:44:20 PM] Brian Katz: Where is queens located?
[4/6/17, 2:44:23 PM] Steve: I do
[4/6/17, 2:44:25 PM] Miller: what? theres tons of towns and countys on long island
[4/6/17, 2:44:33 PM] Steve: 3 sides surrounded by water
[4/6/17, 2:44:33 PM] Launchpad: do you have to cross a bridge to get onto Long Island from where you are? Or do you take a road over city lines?
[4/6/17, 2:44:43 PM] Brian Katz: Four sides homie
[4/6/17, 2:44:45 PM] Steve: 4th surrounded by land (Long Island)
[4/6/17, 2:45:02 PM] Brian Katz: You live on an island
[4/6/17, 2:45:09 PM] Launchpad: you're connect by land to an Island...that means you live on an island
[4/6/17, 2:45:11 PM] Brian Katz: A long one to be honest
[4/6/17, 2:45:15 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/6/17, 2:45:18 PM] Launchpad: lmao
[4/6/17, 2:45:18 PM] Miller: The westernmost end of Long Island contains the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn (Kings County) and Queens (Queens County)
[4/6/17, 2:45:19 PM] Steve: I live on queens
[4/6/17, 2:45:24 PM] Steve: Not Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:45:34 PM] Miller: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island
[4/6/17, 2:45:44 PM] Brian Katz: Queens which is located in Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:45:57 PM] Launchpad: yes you live in the City of New York, but physically you live on Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:45:59 PM] Steve: Aahhh Wikipedia
[4/6/17, 2:46:04 PM] Steve: Excellent source
[4/6/17, 2:46:17 PM] Launchpad: Steve's brain: better source
[4/6/17, 2:46:42 PM] Brian Katz: People only disagree with Wikipedia when it disagrees with them
[4/6/17, 2:46:49 PM] Miller: i mean its not 1998, wikipedia is a pretty good source
[4/6/17, 2:47:14 PM] Steve: We'll agree to disagree
[4/6/17, 2:47:21 PM] Steve: And I pay 4% income tax
[4/6/17, 2:47:28 PM] Steve: Queens is not Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:47:33 PM] Steve: If it was, I wouldn't pay that
[4/6/17, 2:47:44 PM] Brian Katz: If you don't live on Long Island then what bridge or tunnel do you take to get to millers house?
[4/6/17, 2:47:55 PM] Steve: Also, the NYPD doesn't patrol Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:48:02 PM] Steve: It has its own police force
[4/6/17, 2:48:40 PM] Steve: Same thing with the FDNY, sanitation etc etc
[4/6/17, 2:48:41 PM] Brian Katz: I think some Long Island boys must have beat the shit out of steve when he was younger
[4/6/17, 2:48:52 PM] Steve: And yet those organizations are In queens
[4/6/17, 2:48:58 PM] Brian Katz: What bridge or tunnel you take to get to my house bro?
[4/6/17, 2:49:07 PM] Steve: No Long Island boys beat the shit out of me
[4/6/17, 2:49:17 PM] Steve: That's not even logical
[4/6/17, 2:49:33 PM] Brian Katz: Makes sense to me
[4/6/17, 2:49:39 PM] Donk: Lol this is classic steve being hard headed for no reason
[4/6/17, 2:49:45 PM] Steve: What bridge do you take to go from jersey to PA?
[4/6/17, 2:49:50 PM] Brian Katz: You catch the boot out in Long Island?
[4/6/17, 2:49:55 PM] Steve: Oh wait, they are connected by land?
[4/6/17, 2:49:58 PM] Donk: Queens can be both long island and part of nyc
[4/6/17, 2:50:02 PM] Steve: Then they must be the same state
[4/6/17, 2:50:13 PM] Steve: #jerseyisPA
[4/6/17, 2:50:22 PM] Steve: #katzlogix
[4/6/17, 2:50:25 PM] Kiyoon: lolz

[4/6/17, 2:51:20 PM] Steve: You can go two ways
[4/6/17, 2:51:21 PM] Donk: Or thr walt whitman
[4/6/17, 2:51:27 PM] Steve: You can also take the PA turnpike
[4/6/17, 2:51:29 PM] Steve: Homie
[4/6/17, 2:51:31 PM] Brian Katz: It also says welcome to Pennsylvania when I enter it
[4/6/17, 2:51:34 PM] Steve: NJ to PA
[4/6/17, 2:51:52 PM] Steve: And it says you are now in Long Island when I enter Long Island too
[4/6/17, 2:52:01 PM] Brian Katz: Where?
[4/6/17, 2:52:06 PM] Steve: Southern state
[4/6/17, 2:52:11 PM] Steve: Long Island expressway

[4/6/17, 2:53:06 PM] Kiyoon: google it
[4/6/17, 2:53:11 PM] Donk: Clearly steve is right here and everyone else is wrong
[4/6/17, 2:53:22 PM] Steve: I don't care who is right or wrong
[4/6/17, 2:53:45 PM] Donk: Its not the result of the arguement but the journey?
[4/6/17, 2:53:49 PM] Brian Katz: Google is unaware of these signs
[4/6/17, 2:54:07 PM] Steve: Because google has a function for locating those signs
[4/6/17, 2:54:09 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/6/17, 2:54:28 PM] Miller: bro you never used Google Sign‚Ñ¢ ?
[4/6/17, 2:54:31 PM] Miller: www.google.com/signs
[4/6/17, 2:54:33 PM] Miller: amateurs
[4/6/17, 2:55:11 PM] Steve: I'll gladly take pictures of the signs for you katz
[4/6/17, 2:55:33 PM] Steve: Since "they don't exist"
[4/6/17, 2:56:50 PM] Launchpad: you live on an island
[4/6/17, 2:56:55 PM] Launchpad: Long Island
[4/6/17, 2:56:59 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/6/17, 2:57:00 PM] Brian Katz: Okay please do steve
[4/6/17, 2:57:27 PM] Donk: Even queens owns website says long island
[4/6/17, 2:57:29 PM] Launchpad: Im giving this my vote for the most idiotic thing we have argued on.  Is he trolling us?
[4/6/17, 2:58:56 PM] Brian Katz: No he's always had this stance, I'm more or less trolling him lol
[4/6/17, 3:00:16 PM] Steve: Well, it was great while it lasted
[4/6/17, 3:00:39 PM] Launchpad: he may as well be arguing that unicorns are real
[4/6/17, 3:01:29 PM] Kiyoon: they're not?????
[4/6/17, 3:01:40 PM] Brian Katz: What????
[4/6/17, 3:01:56 PM] Steve: Unicorns are absolutely real
[4/6/17, 3:02:06 PM] Brian Katz: Thank god
[4/6/17, 3:02:24 PM] Miller: you guys were probably thinking of mermaids
[4/6/17, 3:03:28 PM] Brian Katz: THEM TOO????
[4/6/17, 3:04:17 PM] Steve: No, everyone knows mermaids don't exist
[4/6/17, 3:04:22 PM] Steve: Old wives tale
[4/6/17, 3:17:11 PM] Donk: Old wives tales are the og fake news
[4/6/17, 3:24:13 PM] Steve: Straight up

[4/6/17, 3:48:59 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/6/17, 3:49:40 PM] Steve: Leave him alone, he's in love...again
[4/6/17, 3:50:15 PM] Launchpad: he better be learning to eat the puss like a champion
[4/6/17, 3:50:33 PM] Launchpad: love cant overcome bad sex
[4/6/17, 3:51:07 PM] Steve: My man cheese in sure handles the puss better than you
[4/6/17, 3:51:13 PM] Steve: *I'm
[4/6/17, 3:51:20 PM] Launchpad: yeah sure brah
[4/6/17, 3:51:36 PM] Launchpad: I have no idea what Im doing
[4/6/17, 3:51:51 PM] Steve: Never said that either
[4/6/17, 3:52:06 PM] Steve: Just said cheezus probably does it better
[4/6/17, 3:52:35 PM] Launchpad: I know and I was telling you why
[4/6/17, 3:53:09 PM] Steve: Nice
[4/6/17, 3:53:20 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese is in love again?
[4/6/17, 3:53:30 PM] Steve: Possibly
[4/6/17, 3:53:36 PM] Steve: See cheezus for more info
[4/6/17, 3:55:04 PM] Miller: only one way to settle this
[4/6/17, 3:55:19 PM] Miller: launchpad and cheese both have to fuck steve and he can declare a winner
[4/6/17, 3:55:46 PM] Steve: I have a pussy?
[4/6/17, 3:55:53 PM] Miller: i guess there is another way you could both fuck the same girl
[4/6/17, 3:55:55 PM] Steve: Damn, first time I'm hearing about this
[4/6/17, 3:56:00 PM] Steve: Hope I've kept it clean
[4/6/17, 3:56:03 PM] Launchpad: Austin?
[4/6/17, 3:56:04 PM] Miller: but then we would be relying on her to make a ruling and she could be biased
[4/6/17, 3:56:11 PM] Steve: Eskimo brothers?
[4/6/17, 3:56:20 PM] Steve: Only watts and I have that connection now
[4/6/17, 3:56:32 PM] Miller: suze?
[4/6/17, 3:56:46 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/6/17, 3:57:02 PM] Steve: We don't kiss and Eskimo brother share
[4/6/17, 4:56:19 PM] Scott: I'm not having sex with Steve
[4/6/17, 4:56:21 PM] Scott: Just saying
[4/6/17, 4:57:47 PM] Kiyoon: just the tip?
[4/6/17, 4:58:06 PM] Scott: No
[4/6/17, 4:58:59 PM] Steve: Don't worry, I don't want to have sex with you either
[4/6/17, 4:59:17 PM] Steve: Was just trying to give you props for being better than Scottie because...come on...look at him
[4/6/17, 4:59:41 PM] Steve: And then bobsy twin 1 thought it would be cute to suggest you eat my non existent vagina
[4/6/17, 5:00:13 PM] Launchpad: I workout bro, thanks for noticing
[4/6/17, 5:00:19 PM] Kiyoon: maybe he was talkinga bout your butthole
[4/6/17, 5:01:17 PM] Steve: I wasn't talking about your body
[4/6/17, 5:01:20 PM] Steve: Never seen it
[4/6/17, 5:01:24 PM] Steve: Don't want to either
[4/6/17, 5:02:56 PM] Kiyoon: Steve, are you sure you don't want to see the Shape of Scott
[4/6/17, 5:03:12 PM] Steve: He's pleasantly plump
[4/6/17, 5:03:16 PM] Kiyoon: push and pull like a magnet?
[4/6/17, 5:03:17 PM] Steve: Women love that apparently
[4/6/17, 5:03:30 PM] Steve: Girls say they are in love with his body
[4/6/17, 5:03:47 PM] Launchpad: no one is in love with ed sheerans body
[4/6/17, 5:03:55 PM] Launchpad: they are in love with his voice, fame & money
[4/6/17, 5:04:10 PM] Steve: We lost scott
[4/6/17, 5:04:14 PM] Steve: Anyway
[4/6/17, 5:04:25 PM] Steve: Cheezus, I was merely defending you
[4/6/17, 5:05:20 PM] Launchpad: I wasn't insulting him, but rather putting out a warning
[4/6/17, 5:06:04 PM] Steve: A warning? Lol
[4/6/17, 5:06:32 PM] Launchpad: yeah that you better keep your woman sexually satisfied or she'll find someone else who will
[4/6/17, 5:07:02 PM] Steve: Or just don't date a woman who cheats
[4/6/17, 5:07:32 PM] Steve: Because a good woman, who cares about you, will work you through that
[4/6/17, 5:07:38 PM] Steve: And work with you on that
[4/6/17, 5:07:57 PM] Launchpad: lmao you sound like a pussy right now
[4/6/17, 5:08:08 PM] Steve: I am what I eat
[4/6/17, 5:08:24 PM] Steve: Also, you should really read up on being a man
[4/6/17, 5:08:33 PM] Steve: It also means you can think that way
[4/6/17, 5:08:36 PM] Launchpad: oh rly?
[4/6/17, 5:08:46 PM] Launchpad: what was the last book you read on being a man?
[4/6/17, 5:09:13 PM] Steve: What does reading a book have to do with it?
[4/6/17, 5:09:24 PM] Launchpad: you tell me
[4/6/17, 5:09:46 PM] Steve: So books are the only things you can read?
[4/6/17, 5:10:12 PM] Launchpad: what was the last *thing* you read about being a man? Maxim article?
[4/6/17, 5:10:20 PM] Justin: gonna say steve could be half right, rpobably a sign that says entering nyc from long island
[4/6/17, 5:10:20 PM] Steve: Not at all
[4/6/17, 5:10:31 PM] Justin: doubtful tehres a sign the other way but who knows
[4/6/17, 5:10:42 PM] Steve: Many different articles
[4/6/17, 5:10:43 PM] Brian Katz: Nah herman
[4/6/17, 5:10:48 PM] Steve: Written by both men and women
[4/6/17, 5:10:50 PM] Launchpad: Does that same sign say you're leaving Long Island?
[4/6/17, 5:11:02 PM] Justin: hence half right
[4/6/17, 5:11:06 PM] Brian Katz: It doesn't exist
[4/6/17, 5:11:14 PM] Justin: because tax purposes queens is nyc
[4/6/17, 5:11:32 PM] Justin: could say entering queensbourugh nyc
[4/6/17, 5:11:33 PM] Steve: Don't worry Herman
[4/6/17, 5:11:36 PM] Brian Katz: It's located on the island of long
[4/6/17, 5:11:44 PM] Steve: Once I send them the pictures katz will simmer down and sit down
[4/6/17, 5:11:56 PM] Launchpad: I'm curious what article says "Find yourself a good woman who wont cheat.  And don't worry about satisfying her sexually, if you're not doing an adequate job she'll teach you"
[4/6/17, 5:12:00 PM] Steve: No need to waste your breath anymore
[4/6/17, 5:12:01 PM] Justin: im still on baord with them, relaly dont think sign exists that says entering long island
[4/6/17, 5:12:18 PM] Steve: Yes scott, the article I read said that
[4/6/17, 5:12:32 PM] Steve: Go be an ignorant fucking meathead somewhere else
[4/6/17, 5:12:46 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/6/17, 5:13:12 PM] Launchpad: ignorant meathead software engineer
[4/6/17, 5:13:21 PM] Kiyoon: hey we're all friends here
[4/6/17, 5:13:25 PM] Justin: hmmm not directed at me but sounds like a challenge to post my 3 rep max fail at 295
[4/6/17, 5:13:24 PM] Steve: Apparently they exist
[4/6/17, 5:13:29 PM] Kiyoon: "ignorant girl fucking meathead"
[4/6/17, 5:14:01 PM] Kiyoon: benching?
[4/6/17, 5:14:13 PM] Brian Katz: Got up to 75 push-ups today Herm what's good!?! Lol
[4/6/17, 5:14:18 PM] Justin: yeh crushed 275 so went for it
[4/6/17, 5:14:22 PM] Launchpad: this is fun
[4/6/17, 5:14:29 PM] Justin: failed and gave up after 1
[4/6/17, 5:14:45 PM] Justin: you did 1 set of 75 pushups?
[4/6/17, 5:14:53 PM] Justin: thats fucken insnae
[4/6/17, 5:14:55 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[4/6/17, 5:15:01 PM] Launchpad: Steve's Guide to Being a Man:
1) Read articles
2) Find a Nice Girl‚Ñ¢ who wont cheat
[4/6/17, 5:15:13 PM] Justin: real pushups?
[4/6/17, 5:15:15 PM] Steve: No
[4/6/17, 5:15:21 PM] Brian Katz: Fake ones
[4/6/17, 5:15:22 PM] Kiyoon: pretty impressive Katz
[4/6/17, 5:15:26 PM] Kiyoon: cock pushups
[4/6/17, 5:15:27 PM] Steve: My guide to being a man is not being you
[4/6/17, 5:15:29 PM] Justin: nah i mean real form
[4/6/17, 5:15:37 PM] Justin: 75 pushups in one set is nuts
[4/6/17, 5:15:45 PM] Launchpad: too bad its a good time to be me right now
[4/6/17, 5:15:52 PM] Steve: Because even thought you've discovered your dick in the last year
[4/6/17, 5:16:01 PM] Justin: thats impressive
[4/6/17, 5:16:02 PM] Steve: You still have absolutely no fucking clue
[4/6/17, 5:16:12 PM] Brian Katz: I started at 22 in January and I'm up to 75 today
[4/6/17, 5:16:26 PM] Justin: you do one set a day?
[4/6/17, 5:16:31 PM] Kiyoon: theres a program that apparently can get you to 100 pushups in 30 days
[4/6/17, 5:16:37 PM] Brian Katz: No there's a whole challenge
[4/6/17, 5:16:42 PM] Steve: It's never a good time to be you, unless someone needs to break empty bottles
[4/6/17, 5:16:49 PM] Brian Katz: http://hundredpushups.com/week6.html
[4/6/17, 5:17:06 PM] Kiyoon: lol there it is
[4/6/17, 5:17:07 PM] Kiyoon: sorry six weeks
[4/6/17, 5:17:16 PM] Justin: tahts pretty insane, think at my peak sterngth/weighti i banged out like 45
[4/6/17, 5:17:54 PM] Justin: thats crazy wonder how trasnferable that is to bench
[4/6/17, 5:17:55 PM] Brian Katz: Well I started it at 325lbs and I'm at 282lbs so there is that
[4/6/17, 5:18:06 PM] Justin: wonder what your combine bench would be
[4/6/17, 5:18:15 PM] Kiyoon: probably not transferable
[4/6/17, 5:18:16 PM] Justin: yeh amazing how much that helps
[4/6/17, 5:18:19 PM] Kiyoon: you can probably do a lot of sets of low weight
[4/6/17, 5:18:23 PM] Justin: i fucken hate everything bbody weight since becoming fat
[4/6/17, 5:18:22 PM] Brian Katz: Idk, haven't lifted in awhile
[4/6/17, 5:18:23 PM] Kiyoon: reps*
[4/6/17, 5:18:34 PM] Kiyoon: but I doubt that really factors in much to lifting heavier
[4/6/17, 5:18:42 PM] Justin: yeh but at katz bw im saying repping 225
[4/6/17, 5:18:49 PM] Justin: like they do at combine
[4/6/17, 5:19:03 PM] Justin: he can probbaly do something sick good like 25-30 reps
[4/6/17, 5:19:07 PM] Brian Katz: I could probably do 5-10
[4/6/17, 5:19:13 PM] Kiyoon: Herman
[4/6/17, 5:19:18 PM] Kiyoon: 25-30 reps at 225???
[4/6/17, 5:19:19 PM] Justin: lol nah you could do more its basically same shit as a pushup for you
[4/6/17, 5:19:26 PM] Justin: if he weighs 300
[4/6/17, 5:19:33 PM] Justin: and does 75 pushups
[4/6/17, 5:19:32 PM] Kiyoon: thats what linebackers do
[4/6/17, 5:19:40 PM] Justin: benching 225 probbaly slightly more difficult
[4/6/17, 5:19:44 PM] Justin: thats what im saying
[4/6/17, 5:19:39 PM] Brian Katz: I haven't lifted in awhile but I guess you're right
[4/6/17, 5:19:44 PM] Kiyoon: yeah but hes not pushing up the full 300 pounds
[4/6/17, 5:19:54 PM] Justin: katz probably has crazy impressive combine bench
[4/6/17, 5:20:20 PM] Kiyoon: try it out katz
[4/6/17, 5:20:20 PM] Kiyoon: hit up a bench
[4/6/17, 5:20:26 PM] Kiyoon: I'll say probably 5-10
[4/6/17, 5:20:27 PM] Kiyoon: as he said
[4/6/17, 5:20:35 PM] Justin: i say 15-20
[4/6/17, 5:20:37 PM] Justin: first try
[4/6/17, 5:20:45 PM] Justin: should just try 185 and see how it goes
[4/6/17, 5:20:58 PM] Brian Katz: Miller next time I'm at your house can I try this out?
[4/6/17, 5:21:00 PM] Justin: or 135 and go crazy
[4/6/17, 5:21:08 PM] Justin: yeh i woudlnt jump mto 225
[4/6/17, 5:21:10 PM] Kiyoon: 185 I'd say he can bust out 10-15
[4/6/17, 5:21:21 PM] Justin: but i think considering bw and pushup reps 225 shoudlnt feel crazy heavy
[4/6/17, 5:21:37 PM] Justin: 185 im saying 20+ lock me in on bet
[4/6/17, 5:21:44 PM] Justin: first try lol
[4/6/17, 5:21:52 PM] Brian Katz: Idk maybe
[4/6/17, 5:21:58 PM] Kiyoon: katz have you lifted before
[4/6/17, 5:22:01 PM] Justin: with rpoper warmup befor ehand
[4/6/17, 5:22:01 PM] Kiyoon: I wanna bet Herman haah
[4/6/17, 5:22:04 PM] Brian Katz: I definitely want a spotter lol
[4/6/17, 5:22:09 PM] Justin: he used to lift
[4/6/17, 5:22:16 PM] Brian Katz: I used to
[4/6/17, 5:22:26 PM] Justin: whats most you ever repped 225 back in day?
[4/6/17, 5:22:36 PM] Justin: if you ever even attempted that
[4/6/17, 5:22:43 PM] Kiyoon: 20+ is a lot of reps
[4/6/17, 5:22:47 PM] Justin: well technically its 185 on smith machine
[4/6/17, 5:22:52 PM] Brian Katz: I quit the gym and went diet and my own weight work outs
[4/6/17, 5:23:03 PM] Justin: i get that 75 pushups is alot of pushups for somene weighing 280
[4/6/17, 5:23:02 PM] Brian Katz: Over 10
[4/6/17, 5:23:18 PM] Justin: and extrmeely transferrable
[4/6/17, 5:26:20 PM] Kiyoon: I'll take the under bet
[4/6/17, 5:26:22 PM] Kiyoon: of 20 reps on 185
[4/6/17, 5:27:04 PM] Kiyoon: though 75 is ALOT
[4/6/17, 5:27:11 PM] Brian Katz: How many plates is that? Sand the bar
[4/6/17, 5:27:12 PM] Dan Watts: https://instagram.com/p/BSjoO7iA-lG/
[4/6/17, 5:27:20 PM] Dan Watts: So French wish someone did that to trump
[4/6/17, 5:27:31 PM] Kiyoon: 45+25 on each side
[4/6/17, 5:28:01 PM] Brian Katz: 20? I think I got that
[4/6/17, 5:28:48 PM] Kiyoon: you might
[4/6/17, 5:28:55 PM] Kiyoon: I'm not that confident in that one
[4/6/17, 5:29:06 PM] Kiyoon: 225 under 10 I am more confident in
[4/6/17, 5:29:07 PM] Brian Katz: I'll film it
[4/6/17, 5:30:04 PM] Brian Katz: They'll have to be done on different day, don't think I have the juice to attempt both lol
[4/6/17, 5:30:59 PM] Kiyoon: bar to chest, none of that halfsies BS!
[4/6/17, 5:31:37 PM] Brian Katz: Okay me 3 pull-ups at a time lol
[4/6/17, 5:41:27 PM] Brian Katz: Mr*
[4/6/17, 5:42:02 PM] Kiyoon: whats that got to do with form??
[4/6/17, 5:44:27 PM] Brian Katz: Lol you said you could do like 50 pull ups, but the fine print was 3 at a time. So I find it funny that you're being a sticker for form here lol
[4/6/17, 5:44:50 PM] Kiyoon: pretty sure I said 20
[4/6/17, 5:44:55 PM] Kiyoon: and 5 at a time cmon now
[4/6/17, 5:45:39 PM] Brian Katz: Herm or TK, can I get a confirmation on the amount Kiyoon did that night? Lol
[4/6/17, 5:46:15 PM] Launchpad: No clue about what? I love this generic shit talking
[4/6/17, 5:46:18 PM] Brian Katz: Even if it was 5 that's a 1/4 of the amount you could actually do
[4/6/17, 5:47:01 PM] Kiyoon: I did 7 or 8 chinups that not
[4/6/17, 5:47:03 PM] Kiyoon: night
[4/6/17, 5:47:08 PM] Kiyoon: different from pullups
[4/6/17, 5:47:10 PM] Miller: Damn 165 messages, yea katz happy to host your combine challenge, can do it before or after miller's ale house next weekend
[4/6/17, 5:47:27 PM] Miller: I would also take the under, no disrespect to katz but hermans push-ups equals bench equation is one of the crazier things I've seen
[4/6/17, 5:47:34 PM] Brian Katz: Before after will not care to try lol
[4/6/17, 5:48:08 PM] Brian Katz: I'll be on a wing high
[4/6/17, 5:48:39 PM] Miller: K I'll film it and Evan can spot you
[4/6/17, 5:48:56 PM] Brian Katz: Reverse that, no offense to Evan
[4/6/17, 5:49:19 PM] Justin: I've also seen katz overhead press 275 so there's that
[4/6/17, 5:49:29 PM] Miller: Witness
[4/6/17, 5:49:32 PM] Justin: At 185 I'm pretty confident in him.
[4/6/17, 5:50:15 PM] Brian Katz: When I was 21 I was able to bench 300lbs but that was a long time ago
[4/6/17, 5:50:57 PM] Miller: But volume vs 1rm very different animals
[4/6/17, 5:50:57 PM] Miller: I'm just going off what I see from actual nfl players at the combine as a reference
[4/6/17, 5:50:57 PM] Miller: Wait 185 or 225?
[4/6/17, 5:51:13 PM] Brian Katz: 185
[4/6/17, 5:51:20 PM] Brian Katz: 20xs
[4/6/17, 5:51:42 PM] Brian Katz: I'm saying I could do 225 5-10xs
[4/6/17, 5:52:20 PM] Miller: Gotcha, I thought it was 20 reps at 225
[4/6/17, 5:52:20 PM] Miller: 185 very different, I'd say you could probably do 15 to 20
[4/6/17, 5:52:39 PM] Miller: Yea that probably translates to 15 to 20 at 185
[4/6/17, 5:53:02 PM] Kiyoon: I thinka  pushup is about 60% of your BW
[4/6/17, 5:53:29 PM] Brian Katz: Idk about any of that, but that seems about right
[4/6/17, 5:54:16 PM] Kiyoon: 75 pushups is a ton though, which is why I'm not very confident in my under 20 bet
[4/6/17, 5:54:44 PM] Brian Katz: How many can you do Herm at 185?
[4/6/17, 5:54:45 PM] Brian Katz: Or Kiyoon 185?
[4/6/17, 5:54:59 PM] Kiyoon: 12 max
[4/6/17, 5:56:09 PM] Brian Katz: Your Weight?
[4/6/17, 5:56:33 PM] Kiyoon: around 215
[4/6/17, 5:56:52 PM] Brian Katz: Really? I thought you were like 185
[4/6/17, 5:57:09 PM] Kiyoon: thanks man
[4/6/17, 5:57:13 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/6/17, 5:57:13 PM] Brian Katz: That's pretty good thoughts
[4/6/17, 5:57:18 PM] Kiyoon: but nah I got big bones
[4/6/17, 5:57:19 PM] Brian Katz: Though*
[4/6/17, 5:57:46 PM] Brian Katz: No guts just all bones
[4/6/17, 5:57:56 PM] Kiyoon: straight guts
[4/6/17, 5:59:30 PM] Miller: The over under is 20?
[4/6/17, 5:59:37 PM] Miller: I think there's like 0 relationship, I have seen plenty of skinny guys with good cardio who can bang out 100 push ups but probably couldn't do 135 for 10
[4/6/17, 5:59:43 PM] Miller: And vice versa I'm sure there's huge strong fat guys who can't do 10 push-ups but can bench big numbers
[4/6/17, 6:00:24 PM] Kiyoon: I think Katz could bang out 20, but for the sake of betting I tookt he under
[4/6/17, 6:00:26 PM] Kiyoon: I think KAtz can go 22
[4/6/17, 6:01:01 PM] Miller: You're 215 kiyoon? Damn
[4/6/17, 6:03:40 PM] Brian Katz: Is that relationship weight? Or do you normally walk around at 215?
[4/6/17, 6:08:11 PM] Launchpad: Sadly no, but Vanilla Ice will be there
[4/6/17, 6:09:31 PM] Brian Katz: You know he never misses an organized taco event
[4/6/17, 6:10:09 PM] Kiyoon: normally 215 yeah
[4/6/17, 6:10:25 PM] Kiyoon: I was 230 post ankle surgery when I was lying around not moving
[4/6/17, 6:10:37 PM] Kiyoon: if I'm doing a long distance race I try to get to 200
[4/6/17, 6:10:54 PM] Kiyoon: is that a lot?  What do you weight Millz
[4/6/17, 6:10:54 PM] Launchpad: pretty amazing I might be the skinniest guy in this chat
[4/6/17, 6:10:57 PM] Launchpad: ~185
[4/6/17, 6:11:17 PM] Launchpad: TK, Feinberg maybe
[4/6/17, 6:11:25 PM] Kiyoon: muscles weighs more than fat
[4/6/17, 6:11:36 PM] Kiyoon: boooom üî•üî•üî•
[4/6/17, 6:12:10 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah but you're also the shortest Scotty
[4/6/17, 6:12:22 PM] Justin: baldest
[4/6/17, 6:12:24 PM] Kiyoon: nah taht title is TK
[4/6/17, 6:12:26 PM] Launchpad: 5'10
[4/6/17, 6:12:29 PM] Launchpad: biggest dick
[4/6/17, 6:12:37 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah you are
[4/6/17, 6:12:40 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/6/17, 6:12:49 PM] Launchpad: biggest dick with the biggest dick
[4/6/17, 6:13:30 PM] Brian Katz: How tall is TK?
[4/6/17, 6:14:03 PM] Justin: just saying from lgoci perspective the above big dick statement isnt all that impressive
[4/6/17, 6:17:26 PM] Launchpad: thats not what she said
[4/6/17, 6:18:23 PM] Brian Katz: What the hell is lgoci?
[4/6/17, 6:19:00 PM] Launchpad: herm-speak
[4/6/17, 6:19:37 PM] Brian Katz: Logic?
[4/6/17, 6:19:55 PM] Brian Katz: Damn Herm I have to decide your text now?
[4/6/17, 6:21:47 PM] Launchpad: He's right though, that statement is not impressive.  My dick is
[4/6/17, 6:23:53 PM] Justin: i raed smoe artcile taht siad our brians dont acutally care if a wrod is spleled corerctly as long as the letters are there

[4/6/17, 6:25:11 PM] Launchpad: You don't vowels either

[4/6/17, 8:56:03 PM] Steve: This a pretty well known fact
[4/6/17, 8:56:11 PM] Steve: Like even LP knows it
[4/6/17, 8:57:40 PM] Brian Katz: Herm didn't try to type it like that, Fcat!
[4/6/17, 9:02:25 PM] Miller: Yea what about missing any punctuation or not using the space bar? What do the studies show on that
[4/6/17, 9:51:23 PM] Steve: Donate to the Red Cross
[4/6/17, 9:51:30 PM] Steve: That's a way to help
[4/6/17, 9:55:24 PM] Launchpad: Lol
[4/6/17, 9:57:33 PM] Miller: Steven Souza on the rays batter walk up music is space jam theme song, I respect it
[4/6/17, 9:59:08 PM] Scott: Lol
[4/6/17, 10:33:14 PM] Dan Watts: Of course this somehow won't matter to the majority of American people
[4/6/17, 10:40:39 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/7iMjFoT7yWE
[4/6/17, 10:40:51 PM] Miller: I've never seen that, it's amazing
[4/6/17, 10:40:56 PM] Steve: Worse
[4/6/17, 10:41:08 PM] Steve: People will be on with it because they saw pictures and videos
[4/6/17, 10:41:15 PM] Steve: As if this is the first time that's ever happened
[4/6/17, 10:41:45 PM] Steve: *ok

[4/7/17, 12:59:58 PM] Miller: im just trying to figure out why his steering wheel is on the wrong side
[4/7/17, 1:03:51 PM] Steve: Good point
[4/7/17, 1:04:52 PM] Justin: and why she says la policiica

[4/7/17, 3:02:02 PM] Miller: its 3 boxes of 4
[4/7/17, 3:02:08 PM] Steve: That stupid
[4/7/17, 3:02:08 PM] Brian Katz: Okay I'm in
[4/7/17, 3:02:18 PM] Steve: Like the $250 mac and cheese gold sandwich
[4/7/17, 3:02:29 PM] Miller: $2/cookie is hardly criminal
[4/7/17, 3:02:38 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah I'm with it
[4/7/17, 3:02:47 PM] Steve: I thought it was $24 a cookie
[4/7/17, 3:02:49 PM] Brian Katz: You've tried this miller?
[4/7/17, 3:02:53 PM] Miller: i just ate one
[4/7/17, 3:03:02 PM] Miller: and ive had them before
[4/7/17, 3:03:16 PM] Brian Katz: Great? Good? Meh?
[4/7/17, 3:03:27 PM] Miller: literally the best chocolate chip cookie ive ever had
[4/7/17, 3:03:29 PM] Miller: not hyperbole
[4/7/17, 3:03:41 PM] Brian Katz: Now I needs to try them
[4/7/17, 3:04:03 PM] Brian Katz: Steve you wouldn't eat this because the salt?
[4/7/17, 3:04:27 PM] Miller: what if it was a blind taste test
[4/7/17, 3:04:28 PM] Steve: It's got sea salt?
[4/7/17, 3:04:39 PM] Steve: All I saw was a picture of a cookie and $24 price tag
[4/7/17, 3:04:44 PM] Steve: Didn't open it more than that
[4/7/17, 3:04:56 PM] Steve: I could tell when something has sea salt
[4/7/17, 3:04:58 PM] Miller: did you miss the big picture of the bucket of salt next to the cookie lol
[4/7/17, 3:05:00 PM] Steve: Has a distinct flavor
[4/7/17, 3:05:05 PM] Miller: or the name of the company being salt of the earth bakery
[4/7/17, 3:05:22 PM] Steve: You and I have a different definition of buckets apparently
[4/7/17, 3:05:27 PM] Steve: And I thought that was sugar
[4/7/17, 3:05:34 PM] Steve: Because I didn't click to enlarge
[4/7/17, 3:05:37 PM] Steve: Enhance
[4/7/17, 3:05:39 PM] Steve: Enhance
[4/7/17, 3:05:41 PM] Steve: Enhance
[4/7/17, 3:06:12 PM] Steve: Again, scrolled by and only noticed the price and cookie
[4/7/17, 3:08:17 PM] Miller: yea i wasnt implying you wouldnt know if you were blindfolded, you could def taste the sea salt, just if it was a visual thing that bothered you
[4/7/17, 3:08:47 PM] Steve: Straight taste
[4/7/17, 3:08:51 PM] Steve: And texture
[4/7/17, 3:08:55 PM] Miller: dont worry @16102201963  Our entire product line is all-natural and certified Kosher (OK-D)
[4/7/17, 3:09:00 PM] Steve: Sea salt tends to be left in chunks
[4/7/17, 3:09:09 PM] Steve: Don't like that
[4/7/17, 3:10:39 PM] Brian Katz: I like sea salt
[4/7/17, 3:10:55 PM] Brian Katz: Do you hate the sea?
[4/7/17, 3:11:12 PM] Steve: I prefer pools
[4/7/17, 3:11:19 PM] Steve: Do not hate the sea at all
[4/7/17, 3:14:15 PM] Miller: do you hate salt?
[4/7/17, 3:17:55 PM] Miller: http://gothamist.com/2015/02/24/salt_of_earth_bakery.php @13478047760

[4/7/17, 4:49:03 PM] Miller: The amount of videos I've seen of morons lighting bottle rockets while holding them in their teeth or ass or hand or something is pretty amazing, like how dumb can you be. Those things have a massive amount of sparks and fire that come out of the back of them before they fly away.
[4/7/17, 4:49:04 PM] Miller: https://www.instagram.com/p/BSmM0_uhBrF/

[4/7/17, 7:58:26 PM] Scott: Last minute seems like am interesting characterisation
[4/7/17, 7:58:30 PM] Miller: What's Jewish law say about when a bris is supposed to be

[4/7/17, 8:01:29 PM] Scott: May not need one in hindsight
[4/7/17, 8:01:45 PM] Steve: I also have an extra glove
[4/7/17, 8:02:16 PM] Miller: Yea but is it human sized?
[4/7/17, 8:02:29 PM] Steve: It's large enough for the best paws
[4/7/17, 8:02:34 PM] Steve: *bear
[4/7/17, 8:02:46 PM] Brian Katz: How do you not own a baseball glove? Aren't you an American male?
[4/7/17, 8:03:43 PM] Scott: My ex wife has it
[4/7/17, 8:03:51 PM] Miller: Ha
[4/7/17, 8:03:51 PM] Scott: So I don't own one right now
[4/7/17, 8:03:54 PM] Miller: Guess not

[4/7/17, 8:06:11 PM] Steve: Does she have cheeses Bruce Jenner juice too?
[4/7/17, 8:06:15 PM] Scott: At least that might make sense
[4/7/17, 8:06:26 PM] Steve: Last time I checked equipment doesn't make you a decathlete lol
[4/7/17, 8:06:32 PM] Brian Katz: You drank Bruce Jenner juice? Ick
[4/7/17, 8:07:58 PM] Steve: If it made me an Olympic decathlete? I might
[4/7/17, 8:08:04 PM] Steve: I'd at least consider it
[4/7/17, 8:08:12 PM] Steve: Pause
[4/7/17, 8:19:51 PM] Scott: U would consider it

[4/7/17, 10:31:43 PM] Steve: Headley error was the killer
[4/7/17, 10:32:06 PM] Steve: Fucking 12 million for that guy for two more years
[4/7/17, 10:32:27 PM] Donk: Ubaldo is our terrible contract
[4/7/17, 10:32:40 PM] Steve: We have a worst contract
[4/7/17, 10:32:46 PM] Donk: Arod?
[4/7/17, 10:32:48 PM] Steve: He plays centerfield

[4/8/17, 10:20:17 AM] Kiyoon: I assume you don't run 4 times a week
[4/8/17, 10:27:11 AM] Donk: You cut off the part where andy calls him an ignorant racist
[4/8/17, 10:27:30 AM] Miller: I didn't see it

[4/8/17, 10:34:12 AM] Miller: Lol nothing minorities like more than being told by white people their perceived racism doesn't exist
[4/8/17, 10:39:01 AM] Dan Watts: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[4/8/17, 10:42:41 AM] Steve: @16313981203 I don't run 4 times a week

[4/8/17, 12:33:17 PM] Kiyoon: I can barely do under 10 min
[4/8/17, 12:35:47 PM] Steve: If only I could lift as much as you do lol
[4/8/17, 5:11:35 PM] Launchpad: üëèüëèüëè on that picture
[4/8/17, 5:15:57 PM] Brian Katz: Damn cheese, you really sound like a pussy with that meme
[4/8/17, 5:16:29 PM] Scott: I posted it in the wrong chat. Hence the duplicative post 8n the other.
[4/8/17, 5:21:36 PM] Miller: How was basketball?
[4/8/17, 5:39:20 PM] Brian Katz: We actually had three good games. The first two went to extra buckets and we split it. The third game was won by 4.
[4/8/17, 5:39:28 PM] Dan Watts: Heard cheese dropped like 40
[4/8/17, 5:39:45 PM] Scott: Air cheese was not present
[4/8/17, 5:40:15 PM] Brian Katz: He heard he'd have to man up and at that point he was out lol
[4/8/17, 5:40:38 PM] Miller: And for that reason, he's out
[4/8/17, 5:43:48 PM] Scott: False. I would man up well.
[4/8/17, 5:45:37 PM] Steve: Said no cheese ever

[4/8/17, 6:04:10 PM] Miller: Cheese getting his excuses ready
[4/8/17, 6:04:15 PM] Miller: I couldn't get a ride
[4/8/17, 6:04:34 PM] Steve: Basically I'll only be out in KGB island for an hour or two then have to head back
[4/8/17, 6:04:45 PM] Steve: *long island
[4/8/17, 6:04:51 PM] Steve: Weird autocorrect
[4/8/17, 6:05:03 PM] Steve: I was just texting Luton
[4/8/17, 6:05:07 PM] Steve: *putin
[4/8/17, 6:06:10 PM] Miller: Maybe consider getting a car ~rich Jones~ cheese
[4/8/17, 6:12:53 PM] Justin: What's deal w baseball tomorrow
[4/8/17, 6:13:14 PM] Miller: It's cancelled, come play basketball instead
[4/8/17, 6:13:16 PM] Brian Katz: We playing

[4/8/17, 6:16:27 PM] Justin: Any firm commitment to a number?
[4/8/17, 6:18:07 PM] Brian Katz: We definitely got a game
[4/8/17, 6:18:33 PM] Brian Katz: Question herman is there any chance you come out?
[4/8/17, 6:18:54 PM] Justin: Yeh definitely a chance
[4/8/17, 6:19:08 PM] Justin: Is there any chance I drive hour and a half and not enough ppl show?
[4/8/17, 6:19:20 PM] Brian Katz: Okay just wanted to know. Look I'll be up at 7. So I'll text you
[4/8/17, 6:19:34 PM] Brian Katz: Way less chance of you show lol
[4/8/17, 6:19:39 PM] Justin: Ok that works
[4/8/17, 6:20:16 PM] Justin: Katz I got faith in you crushing combine challenge, not in your baseball number counting
[4/8/17, 6:20:17 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese you manning up? Or are you out for that reason lol
[4/8/17, 6:20:33 PM] Brian Katz: Sweet!
[4/8/17, 6:20:41 PM] Miller: Can't wait for the Herman text tonight at 3am yea I'm still up not gonna make it
[4/8/17, 6:20:52 PM] Justin: Yeh strong possibility
[4/8/17, 6:20:59 PM] Brian Katz: I started strength training today for this challenge. Want to crush it.
[4/8/17, 6:21:12 PM] Brian Katz: Lol for sure
[4/8/17, 6:22:14 PM] Miller: Took some random pre-workout for the first time in years, forgot how fucking weird my skin feels
[4/8/17, 6:22:37 PM] Brian Katz: What's a pre workout
[4/8/17, 6:22:53 PM] Miller: Combination of some shit designed to give you some energy
[4/8/17, 6:23:05 PM] Brian Katz: Like a shake or bar?
[4/8/17, 6:23:09 PM] Miller: Shake
[4/8/17, 6:24:10 PM] Brian Katz: Last question, why would your skin feel weird?
[4/8/17, 6:24:37 PM] Justin: Because it's like crack
[4/8/17, 6:24:39 PM] Miller: One of the ingredients, maybe it's the beta alanine I can't remember
[4/8/17, 6:24:42 PM] Justin: It's stimulant
[4/8/17, 6:24:47 PM] Justin: And that
[4/8/17, 6:24:55 PM] Miller: This one doesn't have the 1 3 dime
[4/8/17, 6:25:00 PM] Miller: That shit was the best
[4/8/17, 6:25:17 PM] Justin: They still stim with like 300 my caffeine
[4/8/17, 6:25:24 PM] Justin: That's like 15 cups soda
[4/8/17, 6:25:23 PM] Brian Katz: What's the biggest amount of protein per serving thing you can consume?
[4/8/17, 6:25:23 PM] Miller: Gives you like a weird tingly feeling
[4/8/17, 6:25:44 PM] Miller: It's less caffeine than in a caffeine pill
[4/8/17, 6:27:52 PM] Miller: http://leanmuscleproject.com/how-much-protein-can-you-absorb-in-one-sitting/
[4/8/17, 6:28:13 PM] Miller: Essentially the idea of the 30g or whatever is a myth
[4/8/17, 6:28:28 PM] Miller: Here‚Äôs the TL;DR version of this article:
Don‚Äôt worry about how much protein your body can absorb in a given meal, because there‚Äôs no evidence to show that there is such a maximum, and plenty of evidence to support the fact that your body can absorb whatever nutrients you give to it.

[4/8/17, 8:17:04 PM] Dan Watts: If bicep rupture, dead
[4/8/17, 8:17:14 PM] Miller: No way it's torn
[4/8/17, 8:17:19 PM] Miller: He would have been crying
[4/8/17, 8:17:34 PM] Scott: Did he trip over something? #cheesewizzclient
[4/8/17, 8:17:37 PM] Miller: Just very bizarre to injure your bicep in that manor
[4/8/17, 9:00:24 PM] Justin: More importantly does he realize he's surrounded by 19 year olds?
[4/8/17, 9:01:21 PM] Justin: Seems like @15165329107 goal though
[4/8/17, 9:07:11 PM] Miller: @15165329107 is in a committed mature relationship please put some respek on his name
[4/8/17, 9:11:23 PM] Steve: Seriously

[4/8/17, 9:17:16 PM] Steve: Not a thing, two different places
[4/8/17, 9:17:30 PM] Sean: Lol
[4/8/17, 9:18:08 PM] Scott: Lol
[4/8/17, 9:21:18 PM] Miller: A Queens iced tea is the same thing as a long Island iced tea but it costs 4% more
[4/8/17, 10:43:40 PM] Dan Watts: @16318489683 do you like Johnson or Cormier in this fight
[4/8/17, 10:43:50 PM] Dan Watts: And what about the weidman fight
[4/8/17, 11:03:27 PM] Brian Katz: Johnson
[4/8/17, 11:07:31 PM] Dan Watts: Why
[4/8/17, 11:15:58 PM] Miller: Do not question the katz
[4/8/17, 11:16:02 PM] Miller: He has spoken
[4/8/17, 11:16:17 PM] Miller: (also because Johnson can mean dick)
[4/8/17, 11:27:31 PM] Dan Watts: Looks like lots of $ coming in for Cormier
[4/8/17, 11:27:40 PM] Dan Watts: Johnson -150 favorite
[4/8/17, 11:31:30 PM] Miller: Isn't that the opposite?
[4/8/17, 11:31:53 PM] Steve: I'll take the underdog
[4/8/17, 11:31:59 PM] Steve: Anyone can bet for me?
[4/8/17, 11:32:24 PM] Dan Watts: -140*, he was higher favorite earlier  its coming down
[4/8/17, 11:32:43 PM] Dan Watts: And I meant to say late $ for Cormier *
[4/8/17, 11:32:58 PM] Steve: Anyone can bet?!
[4/8/17, 11:39:11 PM] Miller: I will how much you want and on who
[4/8/17, 11:40:31 PM] Miller: Although if you're betting the opposite of watts just bet with him and save the vig
[4/8/17, 11:42:23 PM] Dan Watts: Weidman went to Hofstra I want to bet him
[4/8/17, 11:42:35 PM] Dan Watts: Just found this out
[4/8/17, 11:42:40 PM] Dan Watts: Def too late lol

[4/8/17, 11:43:27 PM] Dan Watts: I'll go the other way
[4/8/17, 11:43:31 PM] Steve: I want the underdog
[4/8/17, 11:43:45 PM] Miller: Johnson is the favorite
[4/8/17, 11:43:57 PM] Dan Watts: Johnson -140/ Cormier is +130
[4/8/17, 11:44:36 PM] Steve: I'll take Johnson
[4/8/17, 11:44:46 PM] Dan Watts: Lol fucker
[4/8/17, 11:44:50 PM] Steve: $100?
[4/8/17, 11:45:03 PM] Dan Watts: I don't want Cormier
[4/8/17, 11:45:16 PM] Miller: Steve how drunk are you
[4/8/17, 11:45:28 PM] Steve: Fairly drunk
[4/8/17, 11:45:33 PM] Steve: Still doing this
[4/8/17, 11:46:19 PM] Miller: You just spent 5 minutes saying you wanted the underdog
[4/8/17, 11:46:34 PM] Miller: Then abruptly switched
[4/8/17, 11:46:34 PM] Steve: I want Cormier
[4/8/17, 11:46:42 PM] Miller: Lololol
[4/8/17, 11:46:55 PM] Steve: I didn't even read things

[4/8/17, 11:47:42 PM] Steve: Let's do a bobble head bet
[4/8/17, 11:48:38 PM] Dan Watts: If I get $50 that's almost how much this Ppv cost
[4/8/17, 11:48:51 PM] Steve: Exactly, so why not?
[4/8/17, 11:49:14 PM] Dan Watts: ?
[4/8/17, 11:49:29 PM] Steve: $50
[4/8/17, 11:49:34 PM] Dan Watts: I just explained why $50 is appealing
[4/8/17, 11:49:36 PM] Steve: I only take venmo
[4/8/17, 11:49:44 PM] Miller: Should do a Bobblehead
[4/8/17, 11:50:00 PM] Steve: I would love a Marshall Lynch bobble head
[4/8/17, 11:52:06 PM] Steve: Let's do $50 watts

[4/10/17, 4:55:49 PM] Dan Watts: unless "fancy dress" means something different in the UK
[4/10/17, 4:58:39 PM] Miller: It means like Halloween costumes in UK
[4/10/17, 4:59:23 PM] Miller: Also now laughing at the thought of someone showing up to like a black tie wedding in a hot dog costume
[4/10/17, 4:59:44 PM] Dan Watts: lol
[4/10/17, 4:59:51 PM] Dan Watts: @16195657200 would do that
[4/10/17, 5:04:09 PM] Miller: Always peacocking
[4/10/17, 5:07:50 PM] Dan Watts: üé©üé©üé©
[4/10/17, 5:11:22 PM] Launchpad: tight white pants with dick outline showing > peacocking
[4/10/17, 5:13:06 PM] Dan Watts: we'll see what the white pants data shows in austin
[4/10/17, 5:20:03 PM] Miller: Sounds like a threat
[4/10/17, 5:21:45 PM] Launchpad: it will show my face in close proximity to a cute female flight attendant's face
[4/10/17, 5:22:02 PM] Launchpad: sorry that was NYC data
[4/10/17, 5:22:08 PM] Launchpad: aka Long Island
[4/10/17, 5:34:53 PM] Justin: idk probably 2x that on my one rep assuming those are dumbass bumper plates
[4/10/17, 5:35:17 PM] Miller: Lol it's a crossfitter that's probably 100lbs
[4/10/17, 5:35:25 PM] Dan Watts: #arrogantherman
[4/10/17, 5:35:51 PM] Justin: morelike #crossfitsdumb
[4/10/17, 5:36:06 PM] Miller: Is it?
[4/10/17, 5:36:13 PM] Miller: Look how cool that guy looks
[4/10/17, 5:36:16 PM] Miller: Plates are so big
[4/10/17, 5:36:23 PM] Miller: More bigger plates equals more likes
[4/10/17, 5:36:26 PM] Miller: Wake up
[4/10/17, 5:36:35 PM] Justin: just saying powerlifters precise weights are actually thinner than normal weights...crossfit makes bumper plates for 10 pd wights
[4/10/17, 5:37:54 PM] Launchpad: i don't know that bar looks like its bending
[4/10/17, 5:39:03 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/10/17, 5:39:08 PM] Steve: Pompous lifter
[4/10/17, 5:39:14 PM] Steve: Should be his new fantasy name
[4/10/17, 5:39:33 PM] Launchpad: Arrogant Dieter
[4/10/17, 5:39:55 PM] Miller: 5ever .500
[4/10/17, 5:41:33 PM] Justin: idk well give him max credit at 45x3 35x1 ....385
[4/10/17, 5:42:02 PM] Justin: lol
[4/10/17, 5:55:04 PM] Justin: Cross fit isn't really dumb. Crossfitters are
[4/10/17, 5:56:42 PM] Justin: they are an entire group made up largely of the dickhead at the gym that 1/8th squats 2x his bw, or loads a leg press machine with 3x more than he can do and flexs his ankles
[4/10/17, 5:58:25 PM] Launchpad: except crossfitters go to their own box, you're not going to find them in Globo Gym
[4/10/17, 6:01:33 PM] Justin: was actually gonan say something about that
[4/10/17, 6:02:39 PM] Launchpad: damn our march madness winner finished in the 99.9th percentile
[4/10/17, 6:02:49 PM] Justin: its about 150$ a month for membership to most those places.. I'm sure some of those people that go there are very serious but i mean the percetn compared to a powerlifting gym kinda insulting
[4/10/17, 6:03:04 PM] Launchpad: perfect final four / winner
[4/10/17, 6:03:19 PM] Justin: but i guess thats got a lot to do with beginner's being able to jump into crossfit
[4/10/17, 6:03:37 PM] Launchpad: the $150 a month is because you have a private/small goup trainer
[4/10/17, 6:03:54 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/10/17, 6:04:09 PM] Steve: Herman looking down on anyone for working out might be the funniest thing I've ever read
[4/10/17, 6:04:15 PM] Steve: In the history of reading
[4/10/17, 6:04:48 PM] Justin: ok glad i provided that relief for you
[4/10/17, 6:04:59 PM] Justin: should find better meme's then
[4/10/17, 6:08:51 PM] Steve: Side note, I have a ton of craft beer made by a friend of mine at my house
[4/10/17, 6:09:00 PM] Steve: Don't want it all so I'm giving it away
[4/10/17, 6:09:13 PM] Steve: Anyone want a six pack or two, just let me know
[4/10/17, 6:10:16 PM] Kiyoon: think its more like 300 a month
[4/10/17, 6:10:20 PM] Kiyoon: but probably varies by location
[4/10/17, 6:11:22 PM] Launchpad: i think they are independent franchises
[4/10/17, 6:11:38 PM] Launchpad: so it probably does vary by location
[4/10/17, 6:18:55 PM] Steve: Not all
[4/10/17, 6:19:02 PM] Steve: My gym has crossfire classes
[4/10/17, 6:19:07 PM] Steve: *crossfit
[4/10/17, 6:19:34 PM] Steve: And I'm aware of a bunch of gyms in my area that offer it
[4/10/17, 6:21:05 PM] Miller: Those aren't specific cf boxes
[4/10/17, 6:21:13 PM] Miller: Those are 200 to 300 per month on average
[4/10/17, 7:20:42 PM] Steve: She literally put this on Facebook as if I would want people to know I run 13 minute miles
[4/10/17, 7:20:57 PM] Steve: For 2 single miles
[4/10/17, 7:21:10 PM] Steve: Pretty sure Miller barefoot could do better
[4/10/17, 7:21:58 PM] Justin: definitely a big pot meet kettle moment here, although i cant tell if im being trolled
[4/10/17, 7:22:14 PM] Steve: The beautify of good trolling
[4/10/17, 7:22:34 PM] Steve: Do you really know whether it's happening or not?
[4/10/17, 7:23:38 PM] Steve: *beauty
[4/10/17, 7:28:24 PM] Launchpad: Beautify actually works better in that context
[4/10/17, 7:30:32 PM] Justin: http://i.imgur.com/6NszA8t.gif
[4/11/17, 8:35:34 AM] Miller: https://theringer.com/fast-furious-rankings-d20e77387cce 2 more days @16318489683
[4/11/17, 8:36:08 AM] Miller: (i would re-arrange their rankings and move 5 to the top, followed by 7,6,1 but its a solid list)
[4/11/17, 8:37:48 AM] Brian Katz: Nice looking forward to seeing that sub pop out in I maxx
[4/11/17, 8:38:48 AM] Brian Katz: Btw does anyone want to get a round of golf in on Saturday morning? I have an extra set of clubs if you need to borrow....ahem cheese lol
[4/11/17, 8:39:03 AM] Miller: hes also gonna need you to pick him up
[4/11/17, 8:39:09 AM] Miller: and maybe buy him subway
[4/11/17, 8:39:33 AM] Brian Katz: I'll pick him up, but I'm never eating at subway again
[4/11/17, 9:26:45 AM] James  L: Katz you golf?
[4/11/17, 9:31:45 AM] Kiyoon: you got a hole in one and you never told us about it?
[4/11/17, 9:51:25 AM] James  L: Not a big deal
[4/11/17, 9:51:45 AM] Launchpad: a Hole in One is what they call it in Tennessee when you stick the flag up your butt before you putt.
[4/11/17, 9:52:04 AM] James  L: I'm not nice at gold best game was a 105 not saying the whole in one wasskill
[4/11/17, 9:52:59 AM] James  L: Never knew you buy beers the whole day if you hit a hole in one I was 4 foursomes and hit it on the 5 whole
[4/11/17, 10:02:32 AM] Brian Katz: They beat you out of a day of free brew lol
[4/11/17, 10:03:18 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah I play, I'm no good, just like to get out there.
[4/11/17, 10:04:44 AM] Kiyoon: That's a huge deal Jimbo, hole in one??
[4/11/17, 10:06:25 AM] Miller: its true i have a big golf nerd coworker who its literally all he does, he confirmed this (and he has never hit one and hates you)
[4/11/17, 10:06:52 AM] Justin: I saw it on "the mick "
[4/11/17, 10:07:08 AM] Justin: Everything on tv is true so confirmed
[4/11/17, 10:09:25 AM] James  L: I didn't even want to get out the golf cart and take a picture I was banged up
[4/11/17, 10:11:24 AM] James  L: My friends father was pissed been golfing 35 years and I hit one before him
[4/11/17, 10:14:39 AM] James  L: I have no short game from 75 yards in I'm horrible
[4/11/17, 10:16:02 AM] Kiyoon: I would assume 1% of all golfers has ever hit a hole in one
[4/11/17, 10:16:44 AM] Kiyoon: pulled that percentage out of my ass
[4/11/17, 10:17:02 AM] Launchpad: I saw Goldberg hit an eagle on a par 5 which is just as hard but doesn't get the same fanfare
[4/11/17, 10:21:33 AM] Brian Katz: Anytime the ball goes in and it's not from 15 feet I'm amazed
[4/11/17, 10:34:44 AM] Miller: going out for beers after work if anyone wants to join https://www.yelp.com/biz/faces-and-names-new-york

[4/11/17, 11:57:19 AM] Kiyoon: he had like 98 charges against him for illegally prescribing medecine
[4/11/17, 11:58:18 AM] Miller: (none of which is relevant though)
[4/11/17, 11:58:56 AM] Brian Katz: Let me ask you guys this. If the plane was over booked, why would they drag a guy off who is already seated?
[4/11/17, 11:59:22 AM] Kiyoon: I think the people that needed to get on were United employees
[4/11/17, 11:59:52 AM] Donk: They should have just kept offering more money until someone volunteered
[4/11/17, 11:59:59 AM] Donk: Instead, they got this
[4/11/17, 12:00:01 PM] Miller: http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/10/news/united-overbooking-policy/
[4/11/17, 12:00:09 PM] Miller: agreed @19732079889 its amazing how simple that solution is
[4/11/17, 12:00:23 PM] Kiyoon: I heard it was up to $800 + hotel
[4/11/17, 12:00:28 PM] Kiyoon: which is awesome
[4/11/17, 12:00:31 PM] Miller: they start offering $1k or $2k cash or 1st class trips to europe or something someone will bite
[4/11/17, 12:00:39 PM] Donk: Agreed
[4/11/17, 12:00:49 PM] Miller: that $800 was not even anything special, legally they are required to offer you 4x the cost of the ticket ($800 in this case)
[4/11/17, 12:01:13 PM] Miller: If fliers get to their final destination one to two hours late (or one to four hours late if they're flying internationally), airlines are required to pay double the original one-way fare, with a $675 limit. If fliers get in more than two hours late (or four internationally), airlines have to pay 400% of the one-way fare, up to a $1,350 limit.
[4/11/17, 12:01:45 PM] Miller: amazing how many ppl dont know this and take worse deals when the airlines start offering it to ppl
[4/11/17, 12:02:17 PM] Launchpad: imagine if you were sitting at Applebees and the waiter came over to you and said "Sir you have to get up from this table cause 4 Applebees employees need this table"  And you were like "but I just ordered a Bone-in Pork* Chop with Honey Apple Chutney 20 minutes ago its about to come out"  and they ignored you and physically dragged you away from the table
[4/11/17, 12:03:39 PM] Miller: even better
[4/11/17, 12:03:44 PM] Miller: imagine if you had already paid for it
[4/11/17, 12:05:58 PM] Launchpad: crazy
[4/11/17, 12:05:58 PM] Kiyoon: damn didnt know about the requirements
[4/11/17, 12:06:21 PM] Steve: Don't even know why his criminal history matter at all in this scenario
[4/11/17, 12:06:27 PM] Steve: He wasn't fighting them
[4/11/17, 12:06:34 PM] Steve: He wasn't concealing any drugs
[4/11/17, 12:06:36 PM] Miller: and Passengers have the right to insist on a check in lieu of a free flight or a voucher
[4/11/17, 12:07:02 PM] Miller: yea its just united working overtime to try to defame this guy to help the impending lawsuit
[4/11/17, 12:07:17 PM] Launchpad: I can't believe that these employees thought it would be a good idea to physically remove someone from the plane
[4/11/17, 12:09:52 PM] Justin: i was just poiting out hes a poker player
[4/11/17, 12:10:09 PM] Brian Katz: This will kill united I think, who would ever choose to fly them now?
[4/11/17, 12:10:56 PM] Donk: United isnt going down from 1 bad incident
[4/11/17, 12:11:01 PM] Dan Watts: i'd fly united if the flights were cheap enough
[4/11/17, 12:11:13 PM] Donk: Short term pain, sure
[4/11/17, 12:11:55 PM] Donk: The whole thing was just so easily avoidable
[4/11/17, 12:11:57 PM] Donk: Its silly
[4/11/17, 12:11:58 PM] Dan Watts: united also flies from newark which is more conveient for me so long as im in SI
[4/11/17, 12:12:02 PM] Justin: funny thing is i didnt realize he got back on the plane
[4/11/17, 12:12:09 PM] Justin: bloodied and all
[4/11/17, 12:12:18 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah but if you knew that you might be forcibly removed from the flight, I'd just fly another airline
[4/11/17, 12:12:32 PM] Donk: Who can do the same thing theoretically
[4/11/17, 12:12:33 PM] Justin: presumably every airline has similar policy
[4/11/17, 12:12:37 PM] Dan Watts: i;ve been watching karate videos on youtube, i'm good
[4/11/17, 12:13:09 PM] Kiyoon: wait he got back ont he plane?
[4/11/17, 12:15:21 PM] Miller: yes every airline has this policy
[4/11/17, 12:16:25 PM] Justin: well amybe not permanently
[4/11/17, 12:16:27 PM] Justin: "Chicago Department of Aviation security officers dragging the man, who has not been identified, down the aisle by the arms and legs while other passengers shout in protest. He continued to resist after he was removed and ran back onto the airplane, face bloodied from the encounter."
[4/11/17, 12:16:38 PM] Justin: thoguht was permanently
[4/11/17, 12:16:44 PM] Justin: wheres that video
[4/11/17, 12:17:04 PM] Kiyoon: theres a video of him awake and bloodied
[4/11/17, 12:17:24 PM] Kiyoon: looks like he went through like PTSD or something repeating I need to go home and kill me
[4/11/17, 12:21:44 PM] Dan Watts: i watched the video several times, i don't get it, they grab the guy, theres a loud yell, then all of the sudden he's being carried out bloody and dazed
[4/11/17, 12:22:18 PM] Miller: they smashed his face into the armrest i think
[4/11/17, 12:42:44 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU1HPwKrMrY
[4/11/17, 12:43:15 PM] Launchpad: is that some sort of walking dead reference?
[4/11/17, 12:48:22 PM] Kiyoon: straight racist
[4/11/17, 12:48:26 PM] Kiyoon: #resist
[4/11/17, 12:48:37 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/11/17, 12:51:15 PM] Brian Katz: No that's a Star Wars reference @16195657200
[4/11/17, 2:08:54 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/11/17, 2:12:50 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/11/17, 2:28:33 PM] Steve: Sean spicer about Syria "even butler didn't use chemical weapons"
[4/11/17, 2:28:38 PM] Steve: *hitler
[4/11/17, 2:30:48 PM] Brian Katz: He used zyclon B
[4/11/17, 2:49:37 PM] Miller: what about butler doe?
[4/11/17, 3:07:15 PM] Tk: Spicer commenting on Assad using chemical weapons: "even hitler didnt use chemical weapons on his own people" wtf?!!
Umm..im guessing this is one of those "alternative facts" statements.
[4/11/17, 3:07:52 PM] Dan Watts: new herm
[4/11/17, 3:09:56 PM] Miller: http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/328312-social-media-users-react-to-spicer-calling-concentration-camps
[4/11/17, 3:18:40 PM] Steve: To all of you

[4/11/17, 4:26:09 PM] Launchpad: I doubt it will work though
[4/11/17, 4:26:18 PM] Brian Katz: Steve you broke up with Liz?
[4/11/17, 4:26:32 PM] Launchpad: yeah when did this all happen?
[4/11/17, 4:26:33 PM] Dan Watts: I doubt it will work though

[4/11/17, 4:27:16 PM] Miller: more bombs being dropped than flex debuting a new jayz record
[4/11/17, 4:27:48 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/11/17, 4:28:08 PM] Dan Watts: also we need to find out more about this cheese relationship which was just leaked by @13478047760
[4/11/17, 4:28:20 PM] Miller: lots to unpack
[4/11/17, 4:28:43 PM] Miller: which is timely bc i am going to be sitting a bar watching ESPN w/closed captions
[4/11/17, 4:28:45 PM] Steve: I'm no leak
[4/11/17, 4:28:46 PM] Miller: so i could use some entertainment
[4/11/17, 4:29:06 PM] Launchpad: when did you become single??
[4/11/17, 4:29:13 PM] Steve: I just assumed that watts, after his many visits to cheeses office, had heard about the new possible mrs cheese
[4/11/17, 4:29:39 PM] Launchpad: cmon thats old news...what happened to you??
[4/11/17, 4:29:40 PM] Miller: he was so jealous of your lifestyle he couldnt take it anymore so he broke up w/liz and now he finds out you betrayed him
[4/11/17, 4:29:43 PM] Dan Watts: lol can't confirm or deny that
[4/11/17, 4:30:26 PM] Steve: Oh cheezus
[4/11/17, 4:31:05 PM] Launchpad: fyi I have a vacation clause, so you guys don't gotta worry about Austin, I will be bringing my A game

[4/11/17, 4:31:54 PM] Steve: So everyone else's C game
[4/11/17, 4:31:59 PM] Steve: I'm sure that will help
[4/11/17, 4:32:04 PM] Kiyoon: you have a clause that you are allowed to bang other women on vacation?
[4/11/17, 4:32:15 PM] Dan Watts: sure that's going to go over well
[4/11/17, 4:32:51 PM] Dan Watts: Josie: "So did you sleep with anyone while you were in Austin" Launchpad: "I'm invoking the vacation clause at this juncture"
[4/11/17, 4:33:28 PM] Launchpad: yes
[4/11/17, 4:33:48 PM] Launchpad: "I thought you don't want to know these things"
[4/11/17, 4:33:50 PM] Brian Katz: No he doesn't, he's just not going to tell her
[4/11/17, 4:33:58 PM] Kiyoon: solid
[4/11/17, 4:34:00 PM] Kiyoon: lol oh
[4/11/17, 4:34:04 PM] Launchpad: ill tell her if she asks
[4/11/17, 4:34:12 PM] Brian Katz: No you won't
[4/11/17, 4:34:16 PM] Kiyoon: does she have this same clause
[4/11/17, 4:34:18 PM] Brian Katz: You'll be like no
[4/11/17, 4:34:18 PM] Launchpad: 1) evasion 2) honesty
[4/11/17, 4:34:31 PM] Launchpad: yeah but shes not going to use it
[4/11/17, 4:34:53 PM] Launchpad: I told her when I banged some girl hours before seeing her
[4/11/17, 4:34:54 PM] Miller: Because she doesn't know it exists
[4/11/17, 4:35:03 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty did you cheat on me?
No I didn't, even though I definitely could've, the women wanted my duck bad
[4/11/17, 4:35:15 PM] Launchpad: üê•

[4/11/17, 4:42:47 PM] Launchpad: we fuck like crazy
[4/11/17, 4:43:23 PM] Kiyoon: feel like that has pretty much nothing to do with low self esteem
[4/11/17, 4:43:46 PM] Kiyoon: Is she a Clinton supporter?

[4/11/17, 5:01:52 PM] Launchpad: fact of the matter is, Im not done banging strange tail
[4/11/17, 5:01:59 PM] Dan Watts: can't wait to speak at the wedding: "i knew scotty met 'the one' when he told me 3 days after he started dating Josie 'honestly Im already thining of breaking up'"

[4/11/17, 5:06:50 PM] Launchpad: at least for Cheese's next divorce he gets the satisfaction of firing her for insubordination
[4/11/17, 5:06:58 PM] Scott: Motha fucka
[4/11/17, 5:07:24 PM] Launchpad: (wasn't me)
[4/11/17, 5:08:23 PM] Scott: Not my gf
[4/11/17, 5:08:26 PM] Launchpad: anyway, I already miss banging random girls so we'll see how long this relationship goes
[4/11/17, 5:08:37 PM] Scott: Although it's seeming close to that being it
[4/11/17, 5:08:39 PM] Launchpad: One thing is likely certain -- I will end up crushing this girl
[4/11/17, 5:09:23 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese what are you thirsty for more? Break up with this chick and play the field
[4/11/17, 5:09:44 PM] Scott: I'm good. Lol
[4/11/17, 5:10:09 PM] Steve: That's the creepiest picture of a GF ever
[4/11/17, 5:10:14 PM] Brian Katz: So that's the chick that's going to fleece you next? Nice
[4/11/17, 5:10:25 PM] Scott: Thanks katz
[4/11/17, 5:10:30 PM] Scott: And not my gf again
[4/11/17, 5:10:58 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese golf?

[4/11/17, 5:25:40 PM] Steve: Well, jokes on me.
[4/11/17, 5:27:18 PM] Scott: Exactly
[4/11/17, 5:32:23 PM] Miller: Forgot where I was for a minute and that's all it takes
[4/11/17, 5:32:23 PM] Steve: Sucks
[4/11/17, 5:32:52 PM] Miller: Everyone walks so fucking slow
[4/11/17, 5:41:32 PM] Miller: I can't believe how hot it is, feel like I should have worn shorts

[4/11/17, 5:56:18 PM] Miller: She might be richer than you, but that's on you
[4/11/17, 5:56:25 PM] Miller: Pretty sure you don't get meme money
[4/11/17, 5:56:52 PM] Miller: Or is she killing it from the 2k or whatever she got from the Dr Phil episode?
[4/11/17, 5:57:34 PM] Kiyoon: wasnt she in a bunch of music videos
[4/11/17, 5:57:35 PM] Miller: And that meme wasn't about her, how bout dah?
[4/11/17, 5:57:45 PM] Miller: Oh man music video money
[4/11/17, 5:57:50 PM] Miller: Those girls definitely get paid
[4/11/17, 5:57:55 PM] Miller: Definitely don't do it for free
[4/11/17, 5:58:21 PM] Launchpad: shes getting paid thousands of dollars to make public appearances
[4/11/17, 5:58:41 PM] Miller: I'll eagerly await your sources
[4/11/17, 5:58:57 PM] Miller: And if she has made thousands of dollars that hardly makes her rich
[4/11/17, 5:59:09 PM] Miller: She might even have tens of thousands
[4/11/17, 5:59:31 PM] Launchpad: Danielle Bregoli, the 13-year-old girl who made a living off the term ‚ÄúCash Me Outside,‚Äù is making $30,000 or more per meet and greet.

[4/11/17, 6:00:21 PM] Kiyoon: that sounds like a pretty safe bet
[4/11/17, 6:00:24 PM] Kiyoon: nobody??

[4/11/17, 6:01:32 PM] Launchpad: Miller Approved Sources list is smaller than Hermans Approved Charities list
[4/11/17, 6:01:41 PM] Miller: Nothing is smaller than that
[4/11/17, 6:01:46 PM] Miller: I'm saying one contract
[4/11/17, 6:01:52 PM] Miller: Verified but someone who isn't her
[4/11/17, 6:02:05 PM] Miller: One business who has paid her 30k verifying that
[4/11/17, 6:02:17 PM] Miller: Anything that is not able be made up by her
[4/11/17, 6:02:44 PM] Miller: If I tell a newspaper Heineken is paying me 5m to be at this bar and drink beer does it make it so?
[4/11/17, 6:02:58 PM] Miller: And these people are all massively incencitived to overstate their earnings
[4/11/17, 6:03:07 PM] Launchpad: you only believe whatever you feel like believing before questioning the source
[4/11/17, 6:03:27 PM] Miller: Sure
[4/11/17, 6:03:43 PM] Miller: Can't wait to see her on the next Forbes list
[4/11/17, 6:06:19 PM] Miller: Tomorrow call the hottest club in SD and tell them you're her agent and ask if they're interested in booking her, when they hang up on you because they don't know who she is you can tell me I was right
[4/11/17, 6:11:34 PM] Launchpad: She's 13 she's not booking club appearances
[4/11/17, 6:11:45 PM] Launchpad: And no
[4/11/17, 6:11:55 PM] Miller: Okay then call Dylan candy bar
[4/11/17, 6:12:08 PM] Miller: I'm sure they're throwing around tens of thousands of dollars on a whim
[4/11/17, 6:14:32 PM] Miller: Maybe Barnes and noble? They still exist?
[4/11/17, 6:19:19 PM] Miller: Nevermind I'm clearly overthinking it by actually thinking about it, just take the daily mail at their word
[4/11/17, 6:22:25 PM] Miller: Don't dare question these either, they're written in a newspaper so it's legit
[4/11/17, 6:24:30 PM] Brian Katz: Gross
[4/11/17, 6:26:47 PM] Steve: #fakenews
[4/11/17, 6:40:11 PM] Justin: we really gonna relitigate the fact that making a charity as a tax loophole and donating your money to it isnt donating to a cahrity
[4/11/17, 6:43:12 PM] Justin: but I mean the entire idea of charitable donations is quite rediculous as its merely a way for the top 5%ish of america to reduce tax liability and has been abused relentlessly as a loophole
[4/11/17, 6:43:20 PM] Brian Katz: We're trying to play some baseball Saturday as well if interested?
[4/11/17, 6:45:51 PM] Justin: btw contrary to my inability to run 180 feet, crushed 415 today... then crushed 415x5 with some bands.. and dropped a notch on my workout belt
[4/11/17, 6:46:27 PM] Miller: Basketball I'm in
[4/11/17, 6:49:23 PM] Brian Katz: That's great herman
[4/11/17, 6:50:28 PM] Steve: Not everyone donates for the tax loophole
[4/11/17, 6:50:33 PM] Steve: But you keep generalizing
[4/11/17, 6:50:45 PM] Steve: Also, congrats on losing more weight
[4/11/17, 6:50:51 PM] Steve: It's always a good thing
[4/11/17, 6:51:07 PM] Launchpad: you do realize that tax loophole is available to you too right?
[4/11/17, 6:51:22 PM] Steve: I realize
[4/11/17, 6:51:23 PM] Launchpad: you can deduct all that money you donated
[4/11/17, 6:51:30 PM] Steve: But I donate because I want to help
[4/11/17, 6:51:30 PM] Launchpad: im talking to herman
[4/11/17, 6:51:37 PM] Steve: Not to all charities
[4/11/17, 6:51:50 PM] Steve: Some don't allow you to write it off
[4/11/17, 6:52:05 PM] Steve: ACLU, planned parenthood, to name a few
[4/11/17, 6:54:24 PM] Brian Katz: I would never donate to a charity. I'll donate to my friends doing things for charity's, but never directly to one.
[4/11/17, 6:54:46 PM] Steve: Well that's a shame because a lot of them do great work
[4/11/17, 6:55:25 PM] Brian Katz: A lot of them have sticky fingers, id rather volunteer my time and see the difference I've made.
[4/11/17, 6:56:02 PM] Justin: ok so 1 accountant in this thread
[4/11/17, 6:56:08 PM] Justin: let him come in and explain my statement
[4/11/17, 6:56:13 PM] Launchpad: you cant write off time so whast the point??
[4/11/17, 6:56:18 PM] Justin: actually ok assuming any of you do own taxes
[4/11/17, 6:56:26 PM] Justin: how many of you itemize dedcutions
?
[4/11/17, 6:56:29 PM] Launchpad: I do my own taxes
[4/11/17, 6:56:36 PM] Justin: ok do you itemize?>
[4/11/17, 6:56:37 PM] Launchpad: Ive done it before
[4/11/17, 6:56:44 PM] Steve: I did my own taxes
[4/11/17, 6:56:44 PM] Launchpad: sometimes I do sometimes I don't
[4/11/17, 6:56:49 PM] Justin: ok same question
[4/11/17, 6:56:58 PM] Steve: I do itemize
[4/11/17, 6:57:05 PM] Justin: when do you itemize?
[4/11/17, 6:57:23 PM] Launchpad: If I have enough deductions to take over the standard
[4/11/17, 6:57:27 PM] Launchpad: which this year I did
[4/11/17, 6:57:29 PM] Steve: Especially the last 4 years as a permanent freelance employee
[4/11/17, 6:57:44 PM] Justin: ok well 70% housholds dont itemize
[4/11/17, 6:57:48 PM] Steve: I itemized my car, gas, insurance
[4/11/17, 6:57:51 PM] Justin: which means 70% cant deduct chariatable donations
[4/11/17, 6:57:51 PM] Steve: Car payments
[4/11/17, 6:57:55 PM] Steve: Laptop I bought
[4/11/17, 6:58:08 PM] Steve: Well like I said
[4/11/17, 6:58:15 PM] Steve: I don't write off my donations
[4/11/17, 6:58:18 PM] Justin: leaves 30% of americans who have the ability to itemize
[4/11/17, 6:58:23 PM] Steve: Again, you are generalizing
[4/11/17, 6:58:35 PM] Launchpad: oh no the poor 70%!
[4/11/17, 6:58:45 PM] Justin: of that group i wonder what percent and income of that group choses to take charitable donations
[4/11/17, 6:58:56 PM] Justin: did either of you take chariatable donations when you itemized?
[4/11/17, 6:59:04 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/11/17, 6:59:11 PM] Steve: I don't know if you understand my texts
[4/11/17, 6:59:12 PM] Launchpad: in the past yes
[4/11/17, 6:59:20 PM] Steve: Because I've said it 3 times
[4/11/17, 6:59:24 PM] Launchpad: this year I was too lazy and didn't remember if/what I donated to
[4/11/17, 6:59:42 PM] Justin: my point is chariatable deductions specifically of the bill gates kind are a joke and arent "donations"
[4/11/17, 6:59:58 PM] Steve: Great
[4/11/17, 7:00:00 PM] Justin: in general though they can be used by only a small pct of the public, and are used to avoid having to pay taxes
[4/11/17, 7:00:04 PM] Launchpad: tell that to the inner city kids with computers in their classrooms
[4/11/17, 7:00:20 PM] Steve: They cannot be used to "avoid paying taxes"
[4/11/17, 7:00:24 PM] Justin: now can you make a donation itemize it and collect and not be in that group...sure
[4/11/17, 7:00:24 PM] Steve: That's not a thing
[4/11/17, 7:00:37 PM] Steve: They can give you less of a bill or more money back
[4/11/17, 7:00:39 PM] Launchpad: I had to pay capital gains tax this year and thats bullshit.  I don't see poor people paying capitol gains
[4/11/17, 7:00:41 PM] Justin: ok i have 30 million dollars
[4/11/17, 7:00:50 PM] Justin: i can either give 10 million directly to government
[4/11/17, 7:01:02 PM] Justin: or i can reduce my tax liability and choose wher ei give my money
[4/11/17, 7:01:04 PM] Steve: We aren't talking about that
[4/11/17, 7:01:10 PM] Steve: We are talking about regular people
[4/11/17, 7:01:12 PM] Justin: because i dont want the government to choose for me
[4/11/17, 7:01:16 PM] Steve: I don't know any millionaires
[4/11/17, 7:01:19 PM] Steve: Do you?
[4/11/17, 7:01:21 PM] Justin: hence...its done to reduce tax liability
[4/11/17, 7:01:38 PM] Justin: now 95% americans cant take advantage of this process
[4/11/17, 7:01:34 PM] Steve: If you do, you should really bitch to them
[4/11/17, 7:01:45 PM] Steve: Because none of us here care much
[4/11/17, 7:02:15 PM] Steve: Because it doesn't apply to us or by one we know
[4/11/17, 7:02:16 PM] Launchpad: and I cant deduct my student loan interest
[4/11/17, 7:02:22 PM] Steve: *anyone
[4/11/17, 7:02:50 PM] Justin: no idea on what the laws are with student loans
[4/11/17, 7:03:12 PM] Justin: just stating a fact about who mostly uses charitable donations as writeoffs
[4/11/17, 7:03:22 PM] Launchpad: if you make more than something like 75k you can't deduct student loans
[4/11/17, 7:03:35 PM] Justin: doesnt mean its not a decent economic idea to some degree
[4/11/17, 7:03:49 PM] Justin: real question why you still got student loans?
[4/11/17, 7:03:55 PM] Justin: did you go to grad school?
[4/11/17, 7:04:05 PM] Launchpad: which fucks over people who take out the biggest loans trying to maximize their income: doctors, lawyers, engineers
[4/11/17, 7:04:22 PM] Brian Katz: They got that in San Diego Scotty?
[4/11/17, 7:04:38 PM] Launchpad: I consolidated it early on to have low monthly payments over a longer term
[4/11/17, 7:05:07 PM] Justin: seems like paying interest on that bad financial deciion
[4/11/17, 7:05:31 PM] Justin: or is it pointless paying it off?
[4/11/17, 7:05:42 PM] Launchpad: @16318489683 hahaha saw that they got Taco Tuesday in Hoboken now üåÆüëå
[4/11/17, 7:06:03 PM] Brian Katz: Well yeah but that's a taco pizza
[4/11/17, 7:06:07 PM] Launchpad: what are you talking about, im making my payments
[4/11/17, 7:06:16 PM] Launchpad: same monthly payment every month
[4/11/17, 7:07:16 PM] Justin: i get that but is the principle just too high?
[4/11/17, 7:07:29 PM] Justin: like why not pay more than monthly payments
[4/11/17, 7:08:43 PM] Justin: im presuming that whatever percent that loan is at, specifically after consolidation, its higher than reutrn on immediate investment of money....not my area of knowledge, legitamately just asking
[4/11/17, 7:10:56 PM] Justin: I.E. if your loan at 10% apr woudlnt it be better off to pay off loan with money than using money to invest, specifically if monthly payments do little to nothing to pay down principle?
[4/11/17, 7:11:25 PM] Launchpad: no
[4/11/17, 7:11:49 PM] Justin: ok so you have done the math on that?
[4/11/17, 7:12:00 PM] Justin: or is that a blind guess
[4/11/17, 7:13:09 PM] Justin: feels like this would be something miller would know
[4/11/17, 7:13:29 PM] Justin: @15166335046 / @drunkmiller
[4/11/17, 7:14:34 PM] Dan Watts: The wedding singer guy will me and @15166335046
[4/11/17, 7:14:43 PM] Dan Watts: I ducking need you more than ever
[4/11/17, 7:15:11 PM] Launchpad: theres no such thing as doing the math - rate of return is not guaranteed
[4/11/17, 7:15:16 PM] Miller: Lol Herman still doesn't understand how math works, we've been over this
[4/11/17, 7:15:37 PM] Launchpad: hes overthinking my student loans
[4/11/17, 7:16:14 PM] Justin: im thinking the cost of compounding interest on a student loan probbaly outweighs benefit of return from the market, at some point at least
[4/11/17, 7:16:49 PM] Launchpad: great
[4/11/17, 7:16:49 PM] Dan Watts: I fucking need you more than ever
[4/11/17, 7:16:56 PM] Dan Watts: Picture forthcoming
[4/11/17, 7:16:59 PM] Launchpad: its also less I owe in bills every month
[4/11/17, 7:18:05 PM] Justin: well that just flys in contradiction to all financial advise you make, I.E not investing lowers your monthly costs as well
[4/11/17, 7:18:22 PM] Justin: so why only look at the side of the balance sheet
[4/11/17, 7:18:41 PM] Justin: at one side*
[4/11/17, 7:41:59 PM] Justin: tadaaaaa
[4/11/17, 7:42:01 PM] Justin: https://studentloanhero.com/calculators/student-loan-payoff-vs-invest-calculator/
[4/11/17, 7:57:51 PM] Launchpad: 1) congratulations I dont really care
[4/11/17, 7:58:20 PM] Launchpad: 2) the site is broken investment returns don't update
[4/11/17, 7:59:31 PM] Launchpad: 3) Getting financial advice from Herman is lower on my todo list then diet advice
[4/11/17, 7:59:45 PM] Justin: seriously not disagreeing
[4/11/17, 7:59:54 PM] Justin: which is why im shocked you never thought about it
[4/11/17, 8:00:25 PM] Launchpad: Whether I paid them off or not the interest is still not tax deductible
[4/11/17, 8:00:27 PM] Justin: i know literally nothing about investment
[4/11/17, 8:00:42 PM] Launchpad: Who says never thought about it?
[4/11/17, 8:01:11 PM] Justin: fine never did an actual calculation
[4/11/17, 8:01:33 PM] Launchpad: Here's the thing... your investment rate of return is variable - you can't predict your returns
[4/11/17, 8:01:54 PM] Launchpad: Sure i can say 10 percent sounds great - doesn't mean I'll get it
[4/11/17, 8:01:57 PM] Justin: ok i get that... has nothing to do with this.... you can estimate a average return over the life of your loan and compar
[4/11/17, 8:02:40 PM] Launchpad: .... and.... the difference Ida negligible
[4/11/17, 8:02:42 PM] Justin: you know the cost of the loan...at the least you can find out what average rate of return you would need to breakeven
[4/11/17, 8:02:45 PM] Justin: thats probably true
[4/11/17, 8:02:43 PM] Launchpad: Is
[4/11/17, 8:02:52 PM] Justin: in the end
[4/11/17, 8:03:02 PM] Justin: asusming the rate on the loan isnt insane
[4/11/17, 8:03:04 PM] Launchpad: Have you figured this out with your loans?

[4/11/17, 8:10:38 PM] Justin: btw back to my old point , people who make 2 million dollars or more(5.6%), are nearly twice as charitable as a percentage of their total income as people who pay 1-2 million(3.2%AGI)......wow I wonder why that is...must be people making 1.8 million dont have enough disposable income to donate.... leaving it on that gonna go eat my chicken
[4/11/17, 8:48:34 PM] James  L: -looks like he's boosting Stephens wallet
[4/11/17, 8:55:43 PM] Steve: Just singles, it's fine
[4/11/17, 9:05:48 PM] Scott: Lol

[4/12/17, 8:03:55 AM] Donk: But not wedding crashers
[4/12/17, 8:03:59 AM] Steve: Wedding singer
[4/12/17, 8:04:02 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/12/17, 8:04:19 AM] Steve: Didn't realize that was the wrong hashtag
[4/12/17, 8:04:23 AM] Steve: #fail
[4/12/17, 8:04:27 AM] Miller: ironically we went over this last week
[4/12/17, 8:04:31 AM] Miller: he was def not in the wedding singer
[4/12/17, 8:04:41 AM] Donk: Agreed
[4/12/17, 8:05:29 AM] Miller: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278248/
[4/12/17, 8:05:57 AM] Miller: hashtag fail
[4/12/17, 8:06:46 AM] Donk: He always plays the wedding singer, but wasnt in the wedding singer
[4/12/17, 8:06:58 AM] Donk: Thats just confusing haha
[4/12/17, 8:08:03 AM] Miller: yes this led to a confusing discussion last week when sreve was asking if i knew the march madness commercials w/the guy from the wedding singer and i thought he meant this guy
[4/12/17, 8:12:38 AM] Miller: also lol @17189742074 "looking forward to your next project" aka see if those guys make another movie and have a role for someone singing in there
[4/12/17, 8:13:31 AM] Miller: also if it wasnt for the march madness commercials 5% chance anyone recognized him
[4/12/17, 8:16:28 AM] Miller: lol also wasnt even in wedding crashers, much confusion
[4/12/17, 8:17:00 AM] Donk: Ha, yeah would have thought of that guy from wedding singer too
[4/12/17, 8:17:24 AM] Donk: Also confusing since all ot of those guys are in at least 2 of those movies
[4/12/17, 8:17:41 AM] Miller: watts was scrolling through the entire 120 person imdb credits list for wedding crashers last night trying to find his name when we thought we might have gotten catfished
[4/12/17, 8:18:33 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc-BSxo_fmA
[4/12/17, 8:18:55 AM] Steve: @17189742074 said that line about 4 times
[4/12/17, 8:18:55 AM] Steve: Guy only heard it once
[4/12/17, 8:23:00 AM] Miller: i sent the picture to nicole she asked is that seth? if he was wearing lifts i could see it
[4/12/17, 8:23:08 AM] Steve: So every wedding movie except the two good ones
[4/12/17, 8:23:18 AM] Miller: exactly
[4/12/17, 8:23:27 AM] Steve: If Seth was 100 pounds heavier
[4/12/17, 8:26:31 AM] Steve: Boom
[4/12/17, 8:26:34 AM] Miller: regret not asking him how many people say that to him
[4/12/17, 8:27:08 AM] Steve: Watts was too busy waiting with bated breath for his new project
[4/12/17, 8:31:52 AM] Steve: Two people? He was in it.
[4/12/17, 8:40:24 AM] Steve: That is/was Alexis arquette
[4/12/17, 8:40:51 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[4/12/17, 8:41:14 AM] Steve: She died last year I think
[4/12/17, 8:41:34 AM] Miller: katz you think everyone is dea
[4/12/17, 8:41:35 AM] Miller: d
[4/12/17, 8:41:52 AM] Steve: Alexis actually is
[4/12/17, 8:41:58 AM] Brian Katz: He's dead
[4/12/17, 8:42:07 AM] Miller: did he actually transition to a woman?
[4/12/17, 8:42:17 AM] Steve: Arquette?
[4/12/17, 8:42:19 AM] Steve: I think so
[4/12/17, 8:42:23 AM] Brian Katz: I was wrong about paulie. He just died in the franchise lol
[4/12/17, 8:42:23 AM] Miller: or just played a woman in that movie?
[4/12/17, 8:42:30 AM] Brian Katz: Idk
[4/12/17, 8:42:35 AM] Steve: No he transitioned
[4/12/17, 8:43:11 AM] Brian Katz: He was a cross dresser in real life
[4/12/17, 8:43:23 AM] Steve: He was a transsexual woman in real life
[4/12/17, 8:43:43 AM] Brian Katz: Whatever
[4/12/17, 8:43:50 AM] Steve: Lol not the same thing
[4/12/17, 8:43:59 AM] Miller: both wear womens clothing though
[4/12/17, 8:44:07 AM] Brian Katz: Who cares
[4/12/17, 8:44:09 AM] Steve: Still not the same thing
[4/12/17, 8:44:20 AM] Brian Katz: Doesn't matter
[4/12/17, 8:44:24 AM] Steve: Everyone who is either transgender or a cross dresser
[4/12/17, 8:44:29 AM] Steve: It does to many people
[4/12/17, 8:44:35 AM] Steve: Just not you, clearly
[4/12/17, 8:44:57 AM] Steve: And any organizations that defend their rights
[4/12/17, 8:45:00 AM] Brian Katz: I have no hate for anyone steve, stop labeling people
[4/12/17, 8:45:09 AM] Steve: I'm not
[4/12/17, 8:45:14 AM] Brian Katz: Yes you are
[4/12/17, 8:45:17 AM] Steve: That's just what it is
[4/12/17, 8:45:20 AM] Steve: Nope
[4/12/17, 8:45:29 AM] Steve: It's like saying I'm labeling an Asian for being Asian
[4/12/17, 8:45:36 AM] Miller: labeling
[4/12/17, 8:45:38 AM] Miller: they are people
[4/12/17, 8:45:41 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/12/17, 8:45:42 AM] Steve: Ok
[4/12/17, 8:46:00 AM] Steve: Clearly the trolling has begun early today
[4/12/17, 8:46:00 AM] Brian Katz: Just people to me steve, stop being a racist
[4/12/17, 8:46:06 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/12/17, 8:46:07 AM] Steve: We'll step back from this
[4/12/17, 8:46:10 AM] Miller: i woke up in beastmode
[4/12/17, 8:46:18 AM] Miller: (i did not i feel terrible)
[4/12/17, 8:46:39 AM] Steve: Fire ball shots
[4/12/17, 8:46:43 AM] Brian Katz: Birthday drinks?
[4/12/17, 8:46:54 AM] Miller: too many shots
[4/12/17, 8:46:57 AM] Brian Katz: God damn Tuesday night fireball
[4/12/17, 8:47:04 AM] Brian Katz: Barf
[4/12/17, 8:47:13 AM] Steve: It's millers parents fault
[4/12/17, 8:47:19 AM] Steve: Should have had him on a Friday
[4/12/17, 8:47:24 AM] Miller: its true
[4/12/17, 8:47:36 AM] Brian Katz: They retired, everydays a Friday
[4/12/17, 8:47:50 AM] Miller: also partially true
[4/12/17, 8:47:55 AM] Steve: Well we aren't
[4/12/17, 8:48:04 AM] Miller: also true
[4/12/17, 8:48:06 AM] Steve: And we drink more
[4/12/17, 8:48:16 AM] Miller: idk about that
[4/12/17, 8:48:19 AM] Brian Katz: Get on their level then steve lol
[4/12/17, 8:48:29 AM] Steve: Maybe one day
[4/12/17, 8:48:42 AM] Brian Katz: They ain't got time for that lol
[4/12/17, 8:49:35 AM] Miller: @17189742074 has a stalker
[4/12/17, 8:49:37 AM] Steve: Is it bad that I watched the terminal?
[4/12/17, 8:49:49 AM] Steve: Is it his fat/skinny ex?
[4/12/17, 8:49:51 AM] Miller: why would that be bad? i watched that too
[4/12/17, 8:49:53 AM] Miller: it is indeed
[4/12/17, 8:49:56 AM] Miller: she was at the concert!
[4/12/17, 8:50:18 AM] Miller: well ex is too strong but yes
[4/12/17, 8:50:21 AM] Miller: that girl
[4/12/17, 8:51:35 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/12/17, 8:51:43 AM] Steve: Was she fat or skinny?
[4/12/17, 8:52:15 AM] Miller: i dont remember so im assuming she was the same
[4/12/17, 8:52:47 AM] Steve: Also, slightly ironic and hilarious
[4/12/17, 8:53:12 AM] Miller: so weird she was there
[4/12/17, 8:53:21 AM] Miller: like 95% chance she is stalking him
[4/12/17, 8:53:34 AM] Steve: Did she talk to you guys?
[4/12/17, 8:53:42 AM] Miller: o yea
[4/12/17, 8:54:07 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/12/17, 8:54:22 AM] Steve: Should have gone to the concert
[4/12/17, 8:55:18 AM] Miller: lol ppl were losing their minds when jhene aiko was there like 1) pretty sure theyre fucking so why would she not be there and 2) who cares
[4/12/17, 8:58:55 AM] Miller: now that i have 30 seconds to waste and excel i will explain the @16316620763 tax loophole for him for when he wakes up
[4/12/17, 8:59:36 AM] Miller: another sick loophole to paying less in taxes is just making less money
[4/12/17, 9:35:16 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJGIMd3_LfY
[4/12/17, 9:45:02 AM] Brian Katz: This Bitch is a pig
[4/12/17, 9:46:15 AM] Kiyoon: stop labeling people Katz
[4/12/17, 9:46:45 AM] Brian Katz: I'm not steve, I don't care lol
[4/12/17, 9:48:09 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSM5W41jl74
[4/12/17, 9:53:27 AM] Launchpad: speaking of freaky, the guy in our office who works east coast customer support and comes in at 4am moved to Arizona and now works remotely, so I'm the first & only person in the office right now
[4/12/17, 9:55:29 AM] Launchpad: ive been here for like 20 minutes by myself right now
[4/12/17, 9:56:37 AM] Brian Katz: That's spooky lol
[4/12/17, 9:58:09 AM] Brian Katz: I'm seeing so many memes and videos about united. I don't think they can recover from this.
[4/12/17, 9:58:30 AM] Launchpad: yeah usually someone else would have come in by now its getting weird
[4/12/17, 10:01:22 AM] Launchpad: lol
[4/12/17, 10:02:02 AM] Donk: So ive now watched most of rick and morty, and i have to say, i npw understand why katz posts all of those memes, its fucking hilarious
[4/12/17, 10:05:03 AM] Steve: Actually katz your lack of caring is the problem
[4/12/17, 10:05:06 AM] Miller: oh no
[4/12/17, 10:05:38 AM] Brian Katz: Is it steve? How is my lack of caring a problem to anyone?
[4/12/17, 10:06:06 AM] Steve: Because you don't care that you calling a transgender person a cross dresser is offensive
[4/12/17, 10:06:07 AM] Brian Katz: And yes Donk, possibly my favorite show of all time.
[4/12/17, 10:06:14 AM] Steve: It's deeper than just what a person wears
[4/12/17, 10:06:16 AM] Brian Katz: To who?
[4/12/17, 10:06:31 AM] Steve: Transgender people have deep rooted psychological issues attached to it
[4/12/17, 10:06:36 AM] Steve: Many commit suicide
[4/12/17, 10:06:51 AM] Steve: It's not just "oh, I like to dress like a woman" "look at me"
[4/12/17, 10:07:01 AM] Brian Katz: Just because I don't know what they are, they'd commit divide?
[4/12/17, 10:07:06 AM] Brian Katz: Suicide*
[4/12/17, 10:07:07 AM] Steve: Mainly because people instead of understanding it
[4/12/17, 10:07:24 AM] Steve: Normalize it by saying "that guy just like dressing like a girl"
[4/12/17, 10:07:28 AM] Steve: Or vice Vera
[4/12/17, 10:07:56 AM] Brian Katz: I don't care to understand it. I show no hate towards anybody not named Geno smith
[4/12/17, 10:08:07 AM] Steve: How about this, you and I can go to a housing facility for transgender people up in Harlem and volunteer one day
[4/12/17, 10:08:29 AM] Steve: I'm not saying you hate them
[4/12/17, 10:08:32 AM] Steve: Or anyone else
[4/12/17, 10:08:44 AM] Brian Katz: I'll volunteer, that's fine, I'm still going to call them he she's
[4/12/17, 10:08:46 AM] Steve: I just think as a human, everyone should want to at the very least understand it
[4/12/17, 10:08:52 AM] Steve: We'll see
[4/12/17, 10:09:04 AM] Steve: I'll figure out when we could sign up and we'll volunteer
[4/12/17, 10:09:20 AM] Steve: Or at least try to understand it
[4/12/17, 10:09:22 AM] Brian Katz: Next Saturday?
[4/12/17, 10:09:31 AM] Brian Katz: I'll help out that's fine l
[4/12/17, 10:09:34 AM] Steve: Let me go on their website and see when we can
[4/12/17, 10:09:39 AM] Steve: I'll give you a bunch of days
[4/12/17, 10:09:50 AM] Steve: Again, this wasn't me saying you hate anyone
[4/12/17, 10:09:55 AM] Brian Katz: Do the 23rd we have a nycfc game that day
[4/12/17, 10:10:18 AM] Miller: im actually confused, what do you do there?
[4/12/17, 10:10:43 AM] Steve: So it's basically a homeless shelter specifically for transgender kids who have been shunned by their families
[4/12/17, 10:10:48 AM] Steve: Kicked out of their homes
[4/12/17, 10:10:50 AM] Steve: Abandoned
[4/12/17, 10:10:55 AM] Steve: Just for being transgender
[4/12/17, 10:11:26 AM] Miller: yea i get that
[4/12/17, 10:11:27 AM] Miller: but what do you do
[4/12/17, 10:12:08 AM] Steve: Help with whatever they need
[4/12/17, 10:12:09 AM] Brian Katz: We listen to their stories and try to understand?
[4/12/17, 10:12:26 AM] Steve: Feeding them
[4/12/17, 10:12:35 AM] Steve: Whatever they may need
[4/12/17, 10:12:36 AM] Brian Katz: They can't feed themselves?
[4/12/17, 10:12:39 AM] Miller: lol
[4/12/17, 10:12:46 AM] Steve: I'm sure they have a bunch programs
[4/12/17, 10:12:48 AM] Miller: just bc theyre transgender they cant feed themselves?
[4/12/17, 10:12:51 AM] Steve: Helping them with school work
[4/12/17, 10:12:55 AM] Brian Katz: They have brunch?
[4/12/17, 10:12:58 AM] Steve: Playing sports with then
[4/12/17, 10:13:09 AM] Steve: Yup
[4/12/17, 10:13:14 AM] Miller: i would not let you play sports w/anyone
[4/12/17, 10:13:15 AM] Steve: They are incapable of feeding themselves
[4/12/17, 10:14:01 AM] Brian Katz: Because they're transgendered?
[4/12/17, 10:14:11 AM] Brian Katz: Do they not have hands?
[4/12/17, 10:14:11 AM] Steve: Of course
[4/12/17, 10:14:16 AM] Steve: Nope
[4/12/17, 10:14:18 AM] Steve: Or heads
[4/12/17, 10:14:50 AM] Brian Katz: I think you're confused on what a transgender is
[4/12/17, 10:15:09 AM] Miller: just connecting some dots here but all of a sudden steve is single and now he wants to go hang out w/transgendered people
[4/12/17, 10:15:24 AM] Miller: you got some trans feeding fetish thing?
[4/12/17, 10:15:28 AM] Steve: Yes
[4/12/17, 10:15:32 AM] Steve: That's exactly it
[4/12/17, 10:15:53 AM] Steve: Can't believe I ever get anything past you
[4/12/17, 10:16:26 AM] Brian Katz: So how do we help them?
[4/12/17, 10:16:30 AM] Brian Katz: For real?
[4/12/17, 10:17:11 AM] Steve: I'll send you the website after our show
[4/12/17, 10:17:16 AM] Steve: Don't have time right now
[4/12/17, 10:17:29 AM] Brian Katz: Because if it's feeding them and helping them up, I used to volunteer in a Jewish geriatrics's center in Commack. They actually need that kind of help, and some of them fought the Nazis
[4/12/17, 10:17:58 AM] Miller: now they cant get up either?
[4/12/17, 10:18:14 AM] Brian Katz: They're in their 90's
[4/12/17, 10:18:21 AM] Miller: no the old people i get
[4/12/17, 10:18:30 AM] Miller: theyre old
[4/12/17, 10:18:43 AM] Miller: maybe these are old trans people
[4/12/17, 10:19:05 AM] Launchpad: the nazis made them get on the trains
[4/12/17, 10:19:27 AM] Brian Katz: And that was the least evil thing the Nazis did to them
[4/12/17, 10:20:21 AM] Miller: Byron Buxton went 0-for-3 with three more strikeouts Tuesday against the Tigers.
Buxton struck out looking all three times. He was eventually passed over in favor of Max Kepler in the ninth inning. Buxton is now just 2-for-29 (.069) with 17 strikeouts and one walk to begin the season. The 23-year-old looked like he was finally putting it together down the stretch last year, but he clearly still has work to do. It‚Äôs still very early, but the Twins have to be concerned with what they are seeing right now
the @16102201963 maloik has taken down another once-great athlete
[4/12/17, 10:21:11 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/12/17, 10:21:27 AM] Brian Katz: That guy has underperformed for years now
[4/12/17, 10:21:38 AM] Brian Katz: He needs to be traded m
[4/12/17, 10:23:10 AM] Miller: hes done
[4/12/17, 10:23:13 AM] Miller: @16102201963 got him
[4/12/17, 10:34:31 AM] Justin: Except your are being disingenuous in your argument. Sick burn, yeh in my argument I forgot that when you give money away you have less money, that changes my entire perspective.  Tricky question to follow.  Do You have less money when you spend it as well?
[4/12/17, 10:24:25 AM] Brian Katz: Cheese, care to defend yourself against the Maloik accusations?
[4/12/17, 10:26:27 AM] Brian Katz: Lol

[4/12/17, 10:50:04 AM] Steve: You are my first round draft pick in June watts
[4/12/17, 10:50:36 AM] Miller: would still be a bad trade for kiyoon even if you do draft watts at 12 lol
[4/12/17, 10:50:38 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/12/17, 10:50:50 AM] Steve: #fact
[4/12/17, 10:51:02 AM] Brian Katz: Kiyoon got fleeced
[4/12/17, 10:51:39 AM] Kiyoon: doubtful, you guys forgot about the value of the name change
[4/12/17, 10:52:08 AM] Steve: What name change?
[4/12/17, 10:52:31 AM] Kiyoon: the murray group?
[4/12/17, 10:52:55 AM] Miller: im now changing my grade from C- to D+
[4/12/17, 10:53:42 AM] Kiyoon: are you gonna change it to a D when my team beats yours???
[4/12/17, 10:54:28 AM] Miller: your in-season record vs me will have no effect on my rating
[4/12/17, 10:54:35 AM] Brian Katz: No snap
[4/12/17, 10:54:43 AM] Miller: i will retroactively change it to an A plus if you win the belt
[4/12/17, 10:54:56 AM] Miller: the top is cut off
[4/12/17, 10:55:09 AM] Miller: those are steves legs dragging him away though
[4/12/17, 10:55:54 AM] Miller: the alternate version you can clearly hear the audio "fine ill give you all my picks just give me some piece of garbage back"
[4/12/17, 10:57:05 AM] Kiyoon: I'll take the belt

[4/13/17, 10:20:59 AM] Miller: so youre saying she needs help feeding herself?
[4/13/17, 10:22:05 AM] Steve: Troll all you want
[4/13/17, 10:22:07 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah, her paws are unable to open a can of tuna. And who could let her out of the house to get exercise?
[4/13/17, 10:22:08 AM] Steve: Don't care
[4/13/17, 10:22:38 AM] Brian Katz: That's effed up that you don't care for this person. She thinks she's a cat when she's clearly a woman
[4/13/17, 10:23:04 AM] Steve: You trolling is one of the main issues
[4/13/17, 10:23:15 AM] Steve: But continue to get laughs
[4/13/17, 10:23:24 AM] Steve: I'm sure it helps
[4/13/17, 10:23:25 AM] Brian Katz: It's not the tuna thing?
[4/13/17, 10:23:43 AM] Steve: Keep it going
[4/13/17, 10:23:47 AM] Brian Katz: How does me trolling you effect cat people?
[4/13/17, 10:23:52 AM] Steve: Maybe you'll get that coveted lol out there
[4/13/17, 10:25:44 AM] Brian Katz: If you don't care about cat people steve, I'd like you to volunteer in a teams-cat clinic and see how much damage you've caused. They can't feed themselves and some even commit suicide. I'd thought you'd be more open minded about all this.
[4/13/17, 10:25:53 AM] Launchpad: Maureen Ponderosa was Trans-Species

[4/13/17, 10:34:39 AM] Sean: She was transgender though right? Not a transsexual?
[4/13/17, 10:35:07 AM] Dan Watts: i'm at this point not accepting trans-specism or trans-racialism as legitimite things
[4/13/17, 10:35:40 AM] Sean: Haha
[4/13/17, 10:35:49 AM] Sean: Literally you can be trans everything
[4/13/17, 10:35:58 AM] Launchpad: As a part man, part horse cock, I am deeply offended by this
[4/13/17, 10:36:14 AM] Sean: If you think about it... we can officially go to any bar on ladies night and say we're women
[4/13/17, 10:36:20 AM] Miller: i always knew your head looked like a horse dick
[4/13/17, 10:36:22 AM] Miller: this just confirms it
[4/13/17, 10:36:25 AM] Sean: Lmaoooo
[4/13/17, 10:36:49 AM] Launchpad: better recognize me and my writes
[4/13/17, 10:38:09 AM] Brian Katz: Can we just go to a bar on ladies night and say we're women? Would they have to oblige us?
[4/13/17, 10:38:35 AM] Dan Watts: i think bars/clubs have pretty broad rights of refusal
[4/13/17, 10:39:04 AM] Launchpad: and I think they can tell when you're just being an asshole
[4/13/17, 10:39:06 AM] Brian Katz: That's sexist watts, they're not pretty broads, they're ladies
[4/13/17, 10:39:12 AM] Sean: Haha but in theory they would have to
[4/13/17, 10:39:15 AM] Dan Watts: lol
[4/13/17, 10:39:17 AM] Sean: Why would I be an asshole??
[4/13/17, 10:39:28 AM] Sean: Who are they to say that? You know I'm being an asshole yes
[4/13/17, 10:39:32 AM] Dan Watts: i think we would just be really ugly women
[4/13/17, 10:39:36 AM] Sean: Right
[4/13/17, 10:39:46 AM] Dan Watts: and they would refuse us on those grounds
[4/13/17, 10:39:49 AM] Sean: If all you need to do is say I feel like this then that's that
[4/13/17, 10:39:58 AM] Brian Katz: That's messed up, I'm a beautiful lady lol
[4/13/17, 10:40:06 AM] Sean: Grow your hair back
[4/13/17, 10:40:28 AM] Launchpad: Bouncer: "See the sign?  It says no butt ugly trannies"
[4/13/17, 10:40:36 AM] Sean: See that's rude
[4/13/17, 10:40:49 AM] Scott: @15166335046 that trans racial episode was hilarious
[4/13/17, 10:42:00 AM] Brian Katz: I'm associate with being black. I love basket and rap. Plus I love the black ladies.
[4/13/17, 10:43:11 AM] Brian Katz: The messed up part about this is they're not supposed to be talking about it.
[4/13/17, 10:43:25 AM] Dan Watts: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[4/13/17, 10:46:54 AM] Miller: From 2000-2005, the delta between the highest OPS in the MLB (Bonds) and second highest (Helton) was equal to the delta between the second highest OPS in the MLB and the 103rd (Burnitz).

[4/13/17, 11:25:08 AM] Dan Watts: DAMN!
[4/13/17, 11:25:46 AM] Launchpad: dont worry ill get bored of being not single
[4/13/17, 11:26:00 AM] Miller: last time only took 7yrs
[4/13/17, 11:26:12 AM] Launchpad: I learned my lesson
[4/13/17, 11:26:21 AM] Miller: dont date women w/o kids?
[4/13/17, 11:27:20 AM] Miller: thats actually the real question, how long before she comes at you with the "i dont have to listen to you, youre not my father"
[4/13/17, 11:27:34 AM] Miller: according to most forms of media thats a thing that happens in these situations
[4/13/17, 11:32:14 AM] Launchpad: I dont think thats going to happen
[4/13/17, 11:32:17 AM] Dan Watts: #stepdaddyproblems
[4/13/17, 11:32:54 AM] Dan Watts: all that sex you're having you might have #realdaddyproblems
[4/13/17, 11:34:27 AM] Launchpad: nah
[4/13/17, 11:34:46 AM] Launchpad: she already went through that shes not about to start all over
[4/13/17, 11:35:59 AM] Kiyoon: your gf has a kid?
[4/13/17, 11:36:21 AM] Launchpad: yea
[4/13/17, 11:36:29 AM] Launchpad: doesn't live here though
[4/13/17, 1:33:17 PM] Miller: lame, hankins signed w/indy
[4/13/17, 1:35:13 PM] Justin: Wait she lost custody of her kid?
[4/13/17, 1:35:22 PM] Donk: Fuck

[4/13/17, 1:46:52 PM] Brian Katz: lol it's still funny
[4/13/17, 1:52:52 PM] Launchpad: Looks way fake üëé
[4/13/17, 1:56:33 PM] Launchpad: http://brobible.com/sports/article/aaron-rodgers-lifestyle-changes/
[4/13/17, 1:56:40 PM] Launchpad: Arod gay?
[4/13/17, 2:01:15 PM] Justin: Gave up on article after too controlling part.
[4/13/17, 2:02:22 PM] Justin: Anyone with any gossip knowledge knows Olivia munn won't even let arod see his family. So too controlling isn't code for him masking his sexuality as much as it's obviously a true statement.
[4/13/17, 2:03:01 PM] Donk: Obviously
[4/13/17, 2:03:45 PM] Justin: I get my tmz fix when I can. Including them lying about that United airline passenger.
[4/13/17, 2:04:32 PM] Donk: Tmz>brobible for gossip news?
[4/13/17, 2:05:06 PM] Justin: Idk brobible isn't on my tv by mistake occasionally
[4/13/17, 2:06:13 PM] Donk: I will say this, olivia munn is very good looking
[4/13/17, 2:08:46 PM] Justin: Now I'm learning the ua guy was in fact pill pusher
[4/13/17, 2:08:58 PM] Justin: News is so fake you can't even keep up w it these days
[4/13/17, 2:09:11 PM] Launchpad: Even though this is unsubstantiated gossip - READ THE FUCKEN ARTICLE BEFORE YOU SPOUT OFF YOUR OPINIONS
[4/13/17, 2:09:32 PM] Justin: I read first paragraph
[4/13/17, 2:09:39 PM] Justin: Read my fucken words
[4/13/17, 2:09:56 PM] Justin: "Gave up on article after too controlling part"
[4/13/17, 2:10:03 PM] Justin: Or you just skip that
[4/13/17, 2:10:55 PM] Justin: not to mention theres only 1 more paragraph
[4/13/17, 2:10:59 PM] Launchpad: "Too controlling isn't code for him masking his sexuality" --- getting facials in Beverly Hills and Hanging out and training with Nick Jonas in West Hollywood and getting a personal stylist" is code
[4/13/17, 2:11:54 PM] Launchpad: I know you didn't read the artcle...yet you still interjected your opinion and disagreed with a premise that was not even made
[4/13/17, 2:12:11 PM] Justin: wtf are you going on about
[4/13/17, 2:12:21 PM] Justin: i said i read this far.....stopped
[4/13/17, 2:12:24 PM] Justin: literally said that
[4/13/17, 2:12:53 PM] Justin: do you mean this article which i didnt read
[4/13/17, 2:13:00 PM] Launchpad: I know...but you still gave your opinion and disagreed with a strong manpoint
[4/13/17, 2:13:18 PM] Justin: "Reportedly it was Rodgers who decided to call it quits, because she was reportedly too ‚Äúcontrolling.‚Äù

Is it just me or is that code for something else? Anyway, sorry, back to the original point here.

Amid his split from Munn Rodgers has reportedly been making some big changes in his lifestyle, none of which so far seem to include his estranged family."
[4/13/17, 2:13:34 PM] Justin: is it just me or did i bring up his point as bullshit
[4/13/17, 2:13:46 PM] Justin: which made me stop reading before he got manicures
[4/13/17, 2:14:07 PM] Justin: which btw, isnt all that uncommon for someone with his salary
[4/13/17, 2:14:10 PM] Justin: just saying
[4/13/17, 2:14:19 PM] Launchpad: "‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been getting weekly facials in Beverly Hills and has also hired Ryan Gosling‚Äôs personal stylist to dress him,‚Äù the insider tells Us.

The NFL hunk has also been switching up his fitness routine to work out with Nick Jonas, who primarily trains at the star-studded Unbreakable Performance Center. ‚ÄúHe used to work out in Calabasas with his teammates during the offseason, but this offseason he‚Äôs chosen to work out primarily with Nick Jonas in West Hollywood,‚Äù the pal added."
[4/13/17, 2:14:30 PM] Launchpad: This is the meat and potatoes of the argument
[4/13/17, 2:15:13 PM] Justin: oh well maybe your shitty jouranlist shouldn't have led with something that made me literally dismiss article as nonsense
[4/13/17, 2:15:24 PM] Justin: which is impressive in a 3 paragraph article
[4/13/17, 2:16:13 PM] Sean: I wish he was a homo
[4/13/17, 2:16:13 PM] Miller: damn you just put on the white pants and its like instant gaydar
[4/13/17, 2:16:13 PM] Launchpad: Replace BroBible with Tim Ferris and once again its you spouting off disagreements with something you haven't read
[4/13/17, 2:16:30 PM] Justin: lol you are incredible
[4/13/17, 2:16:55 PM] Justin: god i doubt you have ever read a single word from a article ive posted
[4/13/17, 2:17:12 PM] Justin: yet you can go off on it from looking at the html title
[4/13/17, 2:19:56 PM] Justin: i read half your shitty article...told you i read half your shitty article....called it shit and siad i had to stop reading your shitty article... your repsonse: "you didnt even read the article"....you continued:oh well you read it but " ok well the main crux of article was after that"...."it's just like tim ferris blah blah blah"
[4/13/17, 2:21:41 PM] Launchpad: I know you didn't read the whole article -- but you felt the need to interject your opinion anyway on a premise that was never made ""Too controlling isn't code for him masking his sexuality" "
[4/13/17, 2:21:52 PM] Launchpad: Thats a strong man argument
[4/13/17, 2:22:04 PM] Launchpad: ** straw man
[4/13/17, 2:22:13 PM] Justin: What?
[4/13/17, 2:23:13 PM] Launchpad: No one ever insinuated that Munns controlling behavior is code for Arod masking his sexuality
[4/13/17, 2:23:31 PM] Launchpad: yet you disagreed with that statement as if someone actually made it
[4/13/17, 2:26:12 PM] Launchpad: no not at all
[4/13/17, 2:26:28 PM] Justin: ""Reportedly it was Rodgers who decided to call it quits, because she was reportedly too ‚Äúcontrolling.‚Äù

Is it just me or is that code for something else? Anyway, sorry, back to the original point here."
[4/13/17, 2:26:30 PM] Launchpad: can we get a third party ruling here??
[4/13/17, 2:26:56 PM] Kiyoon: You guys are arguing about Rodgers and Munn breaking up
[4/13/17, 2:27:08 PM] Justin: lol im arguing about seasn spicer
[4/13/17, 2:27:24 PM] Justin: but i get it you are implying he means too bitchy
[4/13/17, 2:29:49 PM] Launchpad: Im just calling out herman for not reading the article but still deciding to form an opinion that disagrees with an imaginary point that wasn't made
[4/13/17, 2:30:14 PM] Launchpad: yes its a stupid gossip article but it could be about anything
[4/13/17, 2:30:19 PM] Miller: i mean article is def implying they broke up bc hes gay
[4/13/17, 2:30:30 PM] Miller: but cant figure out if thats what you 2 idiots are even debating lol
[4/13/17, 2:33:43 PM] Launchpad: were just stupid
[4/13/17, 2:36:06 PM] Dan Watts: @16195657200 gets into a relationship as soon as olivia Munn becomes single. Classic
[4/13/17, 2:36:20 PM] Launchpad: lol

[4/14/17, 9:32:40 PM] Justin: And yeh was like 3.50 for 10 oz soda at train station
[4/14/17, 9:32:40 PM] Steve: Don't do Starbucks in Europe
[4/14/17, 9:32:43 PM] Steve: That's crazy
[4/14/17, 9:32:52 PM] Steve: Just go to a local coffee shop
[4/14/17, 9:32:54 PM] Justin: They have no ice coffee anywhere else
[4/14/17, 9:32:57 PM] Steve: Or cafe
[4/14/17, 9:33:01 PM] Steve: Yes they do
[4/14/17, 9:33:03 PM] Steve: Ask for it
[4/14/17, 9:33:14 PM] Dan Watts: Cafes weren't popping in Switzerland like that
[4/14/17, 9:33:16 PM] Miller: What the ice cube cost?
[4/14/17, 9:33:21 PM] Dan Watts: They have chocolate shops
[4/14/17, 9:33:26 PM] Steve: If they have it in my bordering third world town in Spain they have it in Zurich
[4/14/17, 9:33:29 PM] Miller: That's the only differentiator making this a non free perk
[4/14/17, 9:33:29 PM] Steve: I promise you
[4/14/17, 9:33:50 PM] Dan Watts: I'm sure I could've found a cafe, but it was 8am and a brother wanted a coffee
[4/14/17, 9:33:52 PM] Steve: Ice cube is free
[4/14/17, 9:33:55 PM] Steve: Nice line
[4/14/17, 9:34:33 PM] Dan Watts: Lucerne is a sweet city, there's a really nice casino- is that where you're going
[4/14/17, 9:35:04 PM] Steve: I want to go to Switzerland
[4/14/17, 9:35:05 PM] Dan Watts: They didn't let me in bc I wasn't flossed out, just wearing a t shirt and a light jacket
[4/14/17, 9:35:10 PM] Steve: First Greece this summer
[4/14/17, 9:35:22 PM] Justin: Yeh I mean not a huge deal but 2 things. Most places don't seem to have drip coffee just espresso based coffee. 2. Ice coffee isn't made just by putting ice in coffee
[4/14/17, 9:35:35 PM] Steve: I get it
[4/14/17, 9:35:45 PM] Steve: But the coffee is much better than here
[4/14/17, 9:35:50 PM] Steve: So it doesn't matter
[4/14/17, 9:36:31 PM] Miller: Huh, I always thought it was just literally adding ice cubes to coffee, but I'm not a coffee drinker
[4/14/17, 9:36:43 PM] Steve: No
[4/14/17, 9:36:43 PM] Miller: Learn something new every day
[4/14/17, 9:36:52 PM] Donk: This umpire in the o's game just took a shot to the face from a foul ball, had to be tied down to a board and carted off
[4/14/17, 9:37:04 PM] Steve: The coffee is made and then refrigerated
[4/14/17, 9:37:06 PM] Steve: I think
[4/14/17, 9:37:06 PM] Miller: I did work at Starbucks but apparently I've forgotten everything
[4/14/17, 9:37:13 PM] Steve: Never worked in a coffee shop
[4/14/17, 9:37:15 PM] Donk: First time ive seen an ump have to be carted off
[4/14/17, 9:37:53 PM] Steve: Franchise coffee places do coffee on ice
[4/14/17, 9:37:59 PM] Justin: Didn't realize there was a casino there. We were supposed to stay Lucerne a night  but last minute cut it out because the louve, Paris was next stop, is closed on Tuesdays. So making daytrip lucerne today
[4/14/17, 9:38:57 PM] Sean: Yeah it's coffee that is double brewed, refrigerated, and then poured over ice
[4/14/17, 9:39:02 PM] Sean: At dunkin at least
[4/14/17, 9:39:12 PM] Steve: It's also very strong coffee usually
[4/14/17, 9:39:20 PM] Steve: Because it's still going to be diluted
[4/14/17, 9:39:21 PM] Sean: In Spain I have to order it hot and pour it into ice
[4/14/17, 9:39:27 PM] Steve: Yea
[4/14/17, 9:39:31 PM] Steve: They will do that
[4/14/17, 9:39:34 PM] Steve: At he very least
[4/14/17, 9:39:52 PM] Steve: But we also live in a borderline 2nd world town
[4/14/17, 9:40:01 PM] Dan Watts: Cold brew is the only way to go
[4/14/17, 9:40:52 PM] Dan Watts: @16316620763 you part of a tour group or are you free styling?
[4/14/17, 9:41:02 PM] Sean: Cold brew üôåüèªüôåüèª
[4/14/17, 9:41:41 PM] Dan Watts: @15165329107 you know about that nitro cold brew @sbux?
[4/14/17, 9:43:15 PM] Justin: Being that everyone was Speaking of salt, Saw there is a new salt cold brew
[4/14/17, 9:44:12 PM] Justin: Never had nitro cold brew, feel like it's only in city and I'm more a DD guy
[4/14/17, 9:58:58 PM] Sean: No never heard of it!
[4/14/17, 9:59:25 PM] Dan Watts: Life changing
[4/14/17, 9:59:45 PM] Dan Watts: It comes out of a tap like a beer
[4/14/17, 10:01:10 PM] Scott: It is extremely good
[4/14/17, 10:17:33 PM] Justin: What happened with penn?
[4/14/17, 10:53:07 PM] Sean: What
[4/14/17, 10:53:09 PM] Sean: Where?

[4/15/17, 9:03:33 AM] James  L: Where's your apron TK?

[4/15/17, 10:45:02 AM] Steve: ^this goal is insane
[4/15/17, 10:53:05 AM] Miller: Can someone who knows how to read and has access to email please explain these skills to cheese and then tell him the schedule for tonight (and probably give him a ride)
[4/15/17, 10:53:21 AM] Miller: He also will likely need help feeding himself tonight @16318489683 @13478047760
[4/15/17, 10:53:55 AM] Scott: Don't need a ride anymore
[4/15/17, 11:13:29 AM] Brian Katz: Lol thanks Sean
[4/15/17, 11:13:53 AM] Brian Katz: Cheese if you need help eating I can feed you lol
[4/15/17, 2:25:03 PM] Miller: Is anyone actually betting on @16318489683 tonight or is he just doing this for fun?
[4/15/17, 2:26:31 PM] Dan Watts: I may bet on it, already going to be in the black with the pacers
[4/15/17, 2:27:02 PM] Miller: Couldn't remember if kiyoon had a bet or not
[4/15/17, 2:33:19 PM] Kiyoon: Has Katz been benching?
[4/15/17, 3:13:49 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/XmOy3sNKkdA
[4/15/17, 3:19:16 PM] Scott: Haha
[4/15/17, 3:20:14 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/NaLvs2g1ADc
[4/15/17, 3:20:19 PM] Miller: He's actually nice
[4/15/17, 3:23:18 PM] Scott: That too is hilarious. Nice choice of background music
[4/15/17, 3:53:03 PM] Steve: *too
[4/15/17, 3:53:28 PM] Miller: 160? Nice game
[4/15/17, 3:53:59 PM] Steve: Started off with 4 straight strikes
[4/15/17, 3:54:03 PM] Steve: First time ever
[4/15/17, 3:54:08 PM] Miller: Turkey!
[4/15/17, 3:54:47 PM] Scott: Must be a different Steve
[4/15/17, 3:54:49 PM] Justin: Why Danielle put Emma down for her name?
[4/15/17, 4:06:52 PM] Dan Watts: Pic ?
[4/15/17, 4:37:46 PM] Brian Katz: I have not been benching. Just push-ups
[4/15/17, 4:40:32 PM] Justin: CAn we get some Facebook live for this challenge?
[4/15/17, 4:54:06 PM] Miller: Idk about Facebook live but I'll record it
[4/15/17, 5:36:49 PM] Dan Watts: @19732079889 cavs are charlatans and are in big trouble
[4/15/17, 5:38:29 PM] Brian Katz: I doubt that
[4/15/17, 5:38:46 PM] Miller: @16318489683 where you at? Waiting on you
[4/15/17, 5:39:30 PM] Justin: If katz doesn't warmup properly I might switch to the under.
[4/15/17, 5:39:39 PM] Justin: What we setting this over under at
[4/15/17, 5:39:42 PM] Miller: Are you betting the over?
[4/15/17, 5:39:48 PM] Miller: I thought it was 20?
[4/15/17, 5:40:02 PM] Justin: At 135 or 185?
[4/15/17, 5:40:07 PM] Miller: 185
[4/15/17, 5:40:11 PM] Miller: Cmon 135 lol
[4/15/17, 5:42:00 PM] Justin: Idk have little to go on other than katz weight + theoretical push-up count. Think he'll land in 15+ range though.
[4/15/17, 5:43:35 PM] Justin: Looking back it is 20 for over under. Well I set it as could do 15-20 which jumped immediately to 20
[4/15/17, 5:48:22 PM] Dan Watts: Fine @16316620763 I'll bet you under 15
[4/15/17, 5:48:31 PM] Sean: On my way!
[4/15/17, 5:48:31 PM] Dan Watts: $150!
[4/15/17, 5:52:27 PM] Justin: Katz presumably hour late at this point, 0 prep done....I'll stick to being a coward.
[4/15/17, 5:55:18 PM] Dan Watts: Valiant effort
[4/15/17, 5:56:10 PM] Kiyoon: Damnit I had bet Herman but we didn't bet anything
[4/15/17, 5:56:12 PM] Justin: Cute Evan counting in background
[4/15/17, 5:56:34 PM] Justin: I mean katz just rolled up in jeans with presumably zero prep
[4/15/17, 5:56:59 PM] Justin: But also if he did come close we would have a war here because in theory none of those were a real rep.
[4/15/17, 5:57:56 PM] Justin: Not bad for zero prep warmup and jeans
[4/15/17, 6:13:39 PM] Dan Watts: We are at the bar
[4/15/17, 6:15:01 PM] Sean: üôåüèª
[4/15/17, 6:20:46 PM] Scott: U have a girlfriend now?
[4/15/17, 6:23:55 PM] Dan Watts: I think this is Sean's second stint on tinder
[4/15/17, 6:24:48 PM] Sean: Lmaoooo
[4/15/17, 6:24:53 PM] Justin: I see he went with the ugly duckling philosophy
[4/15/17, 6:24:57 PM] Sean: How did you guys find that?
[4/15/17, 6:25:03 PM] Sean: Great picture of us
[4/15/17, 6:25:11 PM] Sean: I don't know who you calling ugly
[4/15/17, 6:25:31 PM] Justin: Miller and Steve
[4/15/17, 6:26:15 PM] Sean: Oh

[4/15/17, 11:09:44 PM] Kiyoon: Get any matches cheese?
[4/15/17, 11:10:04 PM] Kiyoon: And cheese is either super high or super hammered with his squint eyes
[4/16/17, 12:06:48 AM] Steve: I got one before him
[4/16/17, 12:12:52 AM] Dan Watts: Guys- there was another weightlifting challenge

[4/17/17, 12:23:07 PM] Justin: Man they got luxury toilets where you pay 2$ to take a shit in Europe
[4/17/17, 12:23:32 PM] Justin: Wtf
[4/17/17, 12:23:35 PM] Miller: such elitism
[4/17/17, 12:23:37 PM] Justin: Socialism my ass

[4/17/17, 12:25:41 PM] Miller: same way you dont buy an iphone if you cant afford it
[4/17/17, 12:25:56 PM] Justin: Presumably other answer is do t walk into a high class shopping center in Paris then.
[4/17/17, 12:26:04 PM] Justin: Btw I refused to pee for 2$
[4/17/17, 12:26:26 PM] Justin: Joia however gets to use restroom in class

[4/17/17, 1:56:47 PM] Justin: Didn't realize hat was Jen
[4/17/17, 1:56:51 PM] Justin: Realized it was tia
[4/17/17, 1:59:58 PM] Brian Katz: That day I learned that century 21 was also a department store
[4/17/17, 2:00:48 PM] Donk: I learned that just this second
[4/17/17, 2:04:08 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/17/17, 2:04:40 PM] Justin: I always call forever 21 century 21
[4/17/17, 2:04:55 PM] Justin: Apprently they are very different ends of the economic ladder
[4/17/17, 2:05:04 PM] Steve: Eh
[4/17/17, 2:05:12 PM] Steve: Not really
[4/17/17, 2:05:40 PM] Steve: Forever 21 is more expensive but it's not like dolce gabanna and target
[4/17/17, 2:05:48 PM] Justin: Ain't no Prada at forever 21
[4/17/17, 2:06:06 PM] Steve: Aight no prada at century 21 either
[4/17/17, 2:06:22 PM] Justin: I have a close source that disagrees
[4/17/17, 2:06:30 PM] Steve: Really?
[4/17/17, 2:06:36 PM] Justin: Phd in shopping
[4/17/17, 2:06:44 PM] Steve: Then I must have not walked by the high end shit
[4/17/17, 2:06:55 PM] Steve: I never seen any real high end stuff at century 21
[4/17/17, 2:07:07 PM] Steve: But I've only been in that store like twice
[4/17/17, 2:07:14 PM] Steve: Not an expert at all
[4/17/17, 2:07:16 PM] Justin: Me once.
[4/17/17, 2:07:31 PM] Dan Watts: C21 is basically a higher end TJ Maxx
[4/17/17, 2:07:34 PM] Justin: I'll stick with my confidential source
[4/17/17, 2:07:42 PM] Justin: Yeh she agrees w that
[4/17/17, 2:07:47 PM] Steve: You only have one source
[4/17/17, 2:07:49 PM] Justin: Said it's high end discounted shit
[4/17/17, 2:07:52 PM] Steve: We all know who it is
[4/17/17, 2:07:57 PM] Steve: Yea
[4/17/17, 2:08:04 PM] Dan Watts: high end labels but it's all stuff that didn't sell well at retail
[4/17/17, 2:08:05 PM] Steve: It's like Tj maxx
[4/17/17, 2:08:06 PM] Justin: I mean "he " agrees w that ?.?,?
[4/17/17, 2:08:12 PM] Dan Watts: so they give it to C21
[4/17/17, 2:08:17 PM] Dan Watts: or if theres some minor irregularity
[4/17/17, 2:08:28 PM] Justin: ‚ùì‚ùì‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è
[4/17/17, 2:08:32 PM] Steve: It's literally Tj maxx
[4/17/17, 2:08:47 PM] Dan Watts: yeah but they have big names, fendi, prada, burberry etc
[4/17/17, 2:08:56 PM] Justin: Yeh watts in point btw seems like solid time. Joia said watts looks like Bradley cooper other day
[4/17/17, 2:08:57 PM] Steve: Crazy
[4/17/17, 2:08:57 PM] Miller: forever 21 is fucking wack
[4/17/17, 2:09:00 PM] Miller: if im thinking of the right place
[4/17/17, 2:09:00 PM] Steve: Didn't know
[4/17/17, 2:09:31 PM] Dan Watts: thank you joia for the kind words
[4/17/17, 2:09:32 PM] Steve: Lol @ Bradley cooper
[4/17/17, 2:09:43 PM] Justin: Ego boost
[4/17/17, 2:09:48 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/17/17, 2:09:59 PM] Steve: That's the funniest thing joya has ever said
[4/17/17, 2:12:00 PM] Dan Watts: so much hate
[4/17/17, 2:12:31 PM] Steve: Wizz, you are a good looking man
[4/17/17, 2:12:52 PM] Miller: dont forget also the strongest lawyer we know
[4/17/17, 2:12:53 PM] Steve: But at no point in the 10+ years I've known have you ever looked like Bradley cooper
[4/17/17, 2:13:08 PM] Steve: Well that's without question
[4/17/17, 2:13:28 PM] Steve: It's like saying I look like vin diesel
[4/17/17, 2:15:32 PM] Kiyoon: BAHAHAH
[4/17/17, 2:15:46 PM] Steve: Damn, century 21 has a ton of high end shit
[4/17/17, 2:15:58 PM] Steve: Mind blown
[4/17/17, 2:16:34 PM] Kiyoon: Katz we need a Steve face on Vin Diesel body here
[4/17/17, 2:17:38 PM] Launchpad: and while we're at it, my face on Dave Attell
[4/17/17, 2:18:50 PM] Steve: Could be LP's twin
[4/17/17, 2:18:53 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/17/17, 2:19:05 PM] Brian Katz: That I was think Ming the same thing millers
[4/17/17, 2:20:13 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/17/17, 2:36:15 PM] Launchpad: That guy fucks!
[4/17/17, 2:45:32 PM] Launchpad: just a reminder for you single guys out there: https://www.quora.com/When-did-being-a-nice-guy-become-a-bad-thing/answer/Adam-Taha-3
[4/17/17, 2:48:44 PM] Dan Watts: launchpad has been in a relationship for exactly 1 week and he's already trying to drop knowledge
[4/17/17, 2:49:04 PM] Launchpad: lol no just my daily quora reads
[4/17/17, 2:50:20 PM] Launchpad: i just dont know how Im going to survive this relationship
[4/17/17, 2:50:35 PM] Launchpad: 50/50 it doesn't make it til May
[4/17/17, 2:52:59 PM] Dan Watts: may 2024?
[4/17/17, 2:53:32 PM] Launchpad: funny guy
[4/17/17, 2:54:07 PM] Dan Watts: if we don't learn from the past we are doomed to repeat it
[4/17/17, 2:54:53 PM] Launchpad: true story
[4/17/17, 2:56:33 PM] Miller: gonna end before you even go on vacation and have a chance to use your vacation pass?
[4/17/17, 2:56:51 PM] Launchpad: probably
[4/17/17, 2:57:32 PM] Dan Watts: i'll bet against that
[4/17/17, 2:57:46 PM] Launchpad: wow....no faith in me
[4/17/17, 2:58:14 PM] Dan Watts: i bet that not only are you with her when you go to Austin, you won't even use your vacation card
[4/17/17, 2:58:34 PM] Launchpad: hater
[4/17/17, 2:58:41 PM] Launchpad: this better be reverse psychology
[4/17/17, 2:59:09 PM] Launchpad: such a shitty time to be in a relationship too, cause a bunch of my friends have since become single
[4/17/17, 2:59:30 PM] Miller: and its getting nice outside
[4/17/17, 2:59:30 PM] Miller: reverse cuffin season
[4/17/17, 3:00:10 PM] Miller: at least nice to see you list @13478047760 as not only a friend but a reason you regret being in a relationship
[4/17/17, 3:00:23 PM] Miller: and @16102201963 as well
[4/17/17, 3:03:31 PM] Launchpad: SD friends too
[4/17/17, 3:04:26 PM] Launchpad: Cheese and Steve saw that work I did on that flight attendant in NY and wanted a part of that action
[4/17/17, 3:07:31 PM] Steve: I didn't see any work you did on any flight attendant
[4/17/17, 3:09:24 PM] Launchpad: on the dancefloor in the basement of that club
[4/17/17, 3:09:31 PM] Dan Watts: steve was involved in a dance off that night
[4/17/17, 3:10:12 PM] Launchpad: lol I DO remember that
[4/17/17, 3:13:17 PM] Dan Watts: i also remember leaving @16195657200 at the club bc i thought he was going to seal the deal
[4/17/17, 3:14:00 PM] Miller: (or you just forgot about him)
[4/17/17, 3:14:12 PM] Launchpad: lol yeah what a dissapointment...I was about 5 minutes of battery time away from sleeping in the streets
[4/17/17, 3:14:29 PM] Launchpad: she lived with her family, could not go back with her
[4/17/17, 3:14:32 PM] Dan Watts: and then he had to come to UES where I was staying with a girl and he had to sleep on the couch.  I also remember @16195657200 getting a "super like" on tinder @330 am and he couldn't respond to it bc his phone was dying and there was no samsung charger
[4/17/17, 3:14:48 PM] Dan Watts: all in all a good night
[4/17/17, 3:15:10 PM] Launchpad: lol yup'
[4/17/17, 3:20:39 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/17/17, 3:21:02 PM] Steve: I don't want any part of action of making out with a girl all night and then not getting laid
[4/17/17, 3:24:47 PM] Scott: the threat of me taking my wife's family's depositions worked and i just made an offer to resolve my divorce...pray for me.
[4/17/17, 3:25:59 PM] Launchpad: logistics, I was not on my home turf
[4/17/17, 3:26:26 PM] Launchpad: üé©
[4/17/17, 3:29:08 PM] Steve: Right
[4/17/17, 3:29:12 PM] Steve: That was the problem
[4/17/17, 3:30:04 PM] Launchpad: why don't you tell us all about your sexual exploits Hater Steve
[4/17/17, 3:30:42 PM] Launchpad: Maybe Uncle Hater Steve's got some good stories for this group
[4/17/17, 3:32:03 PM] Steve: I'm not hating at all
[4/17/17, 3:32:09 PM] Steve: You got with a girl that night
[4/17/17, 3:32:24 PM] Steve: I wouldn't necessarily gloat about it but you've obviously chosen that route
[4/17/17, 3:33:33 PM] Launchpad: well I figured I've been silent about it for 6 months and thats just too damn long
[4/17/17, 3:34:30 PM] Miller: silent? you have mentioned it multiple times
[4/17/17, 3:35:21 PM] Launchpad: proof?
[4/17/17, 3:54:24 PM] Launchpad: in other non related news, my company tomorrow is starting a new telecommuting policy Ill be allowed to work from home on Tuesdays & Thursdays
[4/17/17, 3:59:19 PM] Dan Watts: thats pretty awesome
[4/17/17, 5:06:53 PM] Justin: The irony of assuming we know the shitty instagram personalities you follow.
[4/17/17, 5:08:13 PM] Launchpad: 1) thats facebook not instagram
2) Im not following this person
3) Its a comment on a public article - something which you probably know nothing abbout
[4/17/17, 5:17:46 PM] Miller: http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/329049-democrats-welcome-bernie-takeover @16316620763 #DemEnter ?
[4/17/17, 5:18:33 PM] Justin: Funny they just put no money into an election of a berniecrat, ill pass on reading that article
[4/17/17, 5:19:03 PM] Justin: He got 2k night before from state Democratic Party meanwhile republicans gave 250k so is opponent could label him as a baby killer
[4/17/17, 5:19:23 PM] Justin: Lost by 6 points in a district where trump won by 26
[4/17/17, 5:20:09 PM] Miller: Berniecrat? doesnt the bible frown on idol worship?
[4/17/17, 5:21:04 PM] Justin: Well if you want a label I could have said a progressive, but then I'd be hearing about why am I branding progressivism
[4/17/17, 5:21:21 PM] Miller: hope his debate skills improve by 2020
[4/17/17, 5:21:29 PM] Justin: Who am I to say such and such is progressivism-so like I said berniecrat
[4/17/17, 5:21:31 PM] Miller: (and he is able to stay alive)
[4/17/17, 5:21:51 PM] Justin: No shot they give him the ticket
[4/17/17, 5:21:54 PM] Miller: at leas it will finally end the #berniewouldhavewon debate
[4/17/17, 5:22:09 PM] Justin: Corey booker cuomo way more likely
[4/17/17, 5:22:35 PM] Miller: corey booker?! when will the prejudice against rich old white people stop?!
[4/17/17, 5:22:36 PM] Miller: this is madness
[4/17/17, 5:22:42 PM] Justin: And way is an understatement. Cuomo gives perfect cover where we could have the "what is a progressive fight"
[4/17/17, 5:23:03 PM] Miller: 2020 im voting for whoever promises to fix the LIRR tbh
[4/17/17, 5:23:08 PM] Justin: I could give a fuck less about identity politics
[4/17/17, 5:23:26 PM] Justin: Corey booker loves identity politics as does Democratic Party. Done great job for them so far
[4/17/17, 5:24:04 PM] Justin: Sticking  to whining about a racial message instead of actually creating an economic message is not an answer
[4/17/17, 5:25:27 PM] Justin: Trade and immigration have real effects on the economy, bitching about gender discrimination isn't gonna create jobs. Create jobs, then start talking about it
[4/17/17, 5:27:09 PM] Launchpad: Except when you tell me what I should believe because I'm a 'libertarian'
[4/17/17, 5:27:30 PM] Justin: Not sure wtf that means
[4/17/17, 5:27:50 PM] Justin: Does a wage gap exist, of course it does. You have to be a moron to not understand hat reality
[4/17/17, 5:28:21 PM] Justin: Does white privledge exist of course it fucken does
[4/17/17, 5:29:10 PM] Justin: But white people vote. And white people are effected by these policies economically. So if you are gonna make policies that make people's economic situation worse while providing no economic benefit, shockingly you will lose elections
[4/17/17, 5:32:56 PM] Justin: Meanwhile Donald fucken trump just sold a story of economic progressivism to ride his ticket to the whitehouse. He didn't campaign on typical republican economics. He's an idiot and a liar  but he addressed a real issue of economic insecurity, which considering. 50% of Americans make under something like 38k, dollars is a big fucken issue
[4/17/17, 5:36:00 PM] Miller: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/infowars-alex-jones-performance-artist-playing-character-lawyer-conspiracy-theory-donald-trump-a7687571.html
[4/17/17, 5:36:50 PM] Justin: I didn't click that earlier and it is funny, but I mean presumably just good lawyering.
[4/17/17, 5:37:37 PM] Miller: 2 straight Herman article reactions where he starts out with I didn't read that
[4/17/17, 5:41:51 PM] Justin: Lol. One I refused in fairness
[4/17/17, 5:38:11 PM] Launchpad: sometime he reads the first sentence
[4/17/17, 5:39:18 PM] Steve: And then spends the next arguing why it's wrong
[4/17/17, 5:39:24 PM] Steve: *hour
[4/17/17, 5:43:29 PM] Justin: Just saying I'd love for Alex Jones to be an act, but he likely is that crazy
[4/17/17, 5:49:29 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/ntWieh7YIgY
[4/17/17, 5:50:07 PM] Justin: https://www.quora.com/How-did-you-gain-your-muscle-mass-What-did-you-eat-and-how-did-you-train
[4/17/17, 5:53:33 PM] Miller: Seems pretty obvious he's trolling in some of these, like struggling not to break character
[4/17/17, 5:53:36 PM] Miller: Especially during the tinfoil hat part, he's like openly mocking his guest
[4/17/17, 5:55:05 PM] Launchpad: He does do some satire on his show, so its hard to tell in a mashed up clip what was supposed to be serious or not
[4/17/17, 5:55:41 PM] Launchpad: He says crazy enough shit on his own, no need to take stuff out of context
[4/17/17, 6:48:03 PM] Miller: Whose is it? @16465236894 @16072459839?
[4/17/17, 6:48:16 PM] Scott: Both?
[4/17/17, 6:50:42 PM] Steve: Is that Kat from phi sig?
[4/17/17, 6:52:37 PM] Miller: It is
[4/17/17, 6:52:56 PM] Steve: Correction, I fucked kat too
[4/17/17, 6:53:51 PM] Miller: Lol happy now @16195657200
[4/17/17, 6:55:09 PM] Launchpad: üôå
[4/17/17, 6:55:19 PM] Scott: New Herman
[4/17/17, 6:58:04 PM] James  L: Don't remember her
[4/17/17, 6:58:38 PM] James  L: My model is if I don't remember it didn't happen
[4/17/17, 6:59:30 PM] Launchpad: Of course you do. That's Kat. Tk fucked her friend Amanda in the ass
[4/17/17, 7:03:07 PM] James  L: Na
[4/17/17, 7:15:06 PM] Dan Watts: Kat was so gross
[4/17/17, 7:15:22 PM] Dan Watts: Davi made a sex tape with her and he spit on her face during it
[4/17/17, 7:15:41 PM] Steve: She was def not a girl to bring home to mom
[4/17/17, 7:15:59 PM] Steve: But I'm sure she had a lot of problems that none of use knew or cared about back then
[4/17/17, 7:19:25 PM] Miller: Idk seemed pretty obvious even then she had 0 self esteem and wanted to hang around us (for whatever reason) and assumed she had to be sleeping with people for people to want her around
[4/17/17, 7:32:04 PM] James  L: Did she have red hair?
[4/17/17, 7:33:17 PM] Steve: We basically hung out with homeless people so she clearly didn't NEED to sleep with any of us
[4/17/17, 7:33:38 PM] Dan Watts: Pacers looking good @19732079889 @16318489683
[4/17/17, 7:33:49 PM] Steve: Don't remember
[4/17/17, 7:35:25 PM] Steve: @miller
[4/17/17, 7:35:35 PM] Steve: *@15166335046
[4/17/17, 7:35:48 PM] Steve: You gotta get that despacito remix with Bieber
[4/17/17, 7:35:58 PM] Steve: Shit is 5 üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
[4/17/17, 7:36:40 PM] Steve: https://youtu.be/FRZDXaaT940
[4/17/17, 7:43:11 PM] Donk: So good that they are losing...
[4/17/17, 7:44:34 PM] Steve: They lost the first game too, didn't they?
[4/17/17, 7:45:07 PM] Donk: Yep
[4/17/17, 7:45:17 PM] Donk: Yet watts is still pumping them up
[4/17/17, 7:49:13 PM] Dan Watts: Lost by 1 and should've won the game
[4/17/17, 7:49:35 PM] Donk: Cavs also missed some easy layups at the end of game 1
[4/17/17, 7:49:52 PM] Donk: But regardless, they didnt win
[4/17/17, 8:46:36 PM] Steve: More importantly, are the ya Jews winning again?
[4/17/17, 8:46:40 PM] Steve: *yankees
[4/17/17, 8:46:46 PM] Steve: But great autocorrect lol
[4/17/17, 8:47:04 PM] Steve: Very anti Semitic of my iPhone
[4/17/17, 10:21:45 PM] Tk: Ohhhh...i never banged Kat!!
[4/17/17, 10:23:29 PM] Steve: No one wants to be my Eskimo brother?
[4/17/17, 10:23:36 PM] Steve: I'm trying to add to my EBDB
[4/17/17, 10:26:16 PM] Donk: To be fair, it barely beat the force awakens which didnt have china opening weekend
[4/17/17, 10:26:31 PM] Donk: Still a shit ton of money though
[4/17/17, 10:28:21 PM] Steve: I agree with Donk, it sucks.
[4/17/17, 10:28:56 PM] Donk: I havent seen it, no idea if it sucks
[4/17/17, 10:29:20 PM] Donk: Im sure its an enjoyable ff movie, ie dumb but entertaining
[4/17/17, 10:30:40 PM] Kiyoon: But you did bang Amanda TK
[4/17/17, 10:33:40 PM] Tk: I plead the 5th. Show me the video or snapchat
[4/17/17, 10:34:04 PM] Tk: Davi, steve n raj banged kat
[4/17/17, 10:34:12 PM] Tk: Martin also

[4/17/17, 10:36:49 PM] Donk: And adam i believe
[4/17/17, 10:37:03 PM] Steve: Fif
[4/17/17, 10:37:08 PM] Miller: You can't plead the 5th you already admitted it
[4/17/17, 10:37:14 PM] Steve: Fif
[4/17/17, 10:37:57 PM] Tk: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[4/17/17, 10:37:57 PM] Dan Watts: Who was that kind of cute blonde short chick that everyone banged (not me)
[4/17/17, 10:38:02 PM] Dan Watts: She later got hooked on pills
[4/17/17, 10:38:18 PM] Dan Watts: I think she was friends with ray scott cart and those guys
[4/17/17, 10:38:24 PM] Tk: Ali
[4/17/17, 10:38:31 PM] Steve: Alison Friedman?
[4/17/17, 10:38:33 PM] Miller: Elbow girl?
[4/17/17, 10:38:35 PM] Dan Watts: Yes
[4/17/17, 10:38:42 PM] Steve: Correction, I fucked Ali too
[4/17/17, 10:38:44 PM] Dan Watts: What's her rap sheet
[4/17/17, 10:38:47 PM] Miller: Wasn't kiyoon thirsty for that
[4/17/17, 10:39:03 PM] Dan Watts: Did you fuck her before or after she was a drug addiction
[4/17/17, 10:39:10 PM] Tk: I allegedly cuddled w her twice.
[4/17/17, 10:39:11 PM] Steve: I'm not sure really
[4/17/17, 10:39:23 PM] Dan Watts: üòÇüòÇüòÇTK!!!
[4/17/17, 10:39:23 PM] Steve: TK is a serial cuddled
[4/17/17, 10:39:27 PM] Steve: *cuddler
[4/17/17, 10:39:57 PM] Dan Watts: She had a good face
[4/17/17, 10:40:18 PM] Dan Watts: I think Davi made a sex tape with her too
[4/17/17, 10:40:23 PM] Steve: She was a good person too lol
[4/17/17, 10:41:04 PM] Tk: Im still ashamed for that incident. Cuddle sessions on back to back days. Cant even blame it on that she was resisting.
[4/17/17, 10:42:04 PM] Tk: Yup, i saw the davi video. She was  xanaxd up. Cuz when she finally recalled making the video, she begged him for weeks to delete it.
[4/17/17, 10:42:20 PM] Dan Watts: Fucked up
[4/17/17, 10:42:33 PM] Dan Watts: But not in anyway surprised
[4/18/17, 9:49:42 AM] Miller: @19732079889 so ive listened to the kendrick album ~5x at this point, still relatively meh, its fine, the production is consistently great, the hooks are consistently trash, and his usual monotone flow causes everything to sound the same
[4/18/17, 9:50:00 AM] Miller: DNA, feel, humble, and xxx probably my favorite songs
[4/18/17, 9:50:32 AM] Miller: i dont think it has much replay value though (something i question about almost all of his catalogue)
[4/18/17, 9:51:01 AM] Miller: but w/o googling can you tell me one memorable quotable or hot verse or line? bc ive listened 5x and gun to my head im not sure i could give you one
[4/18/17, 9:51:42 AM] Donk: Not off the top of my head, no
[4/18/17, 9:51:52 AM] Miller: see thats crazy to me
[4/18/17, 9:52:20 AM] Donk: He doesnt do oneliners
[4/18/17, 9:52:30 AM] Miller: im not asking for a punchline like from fab
[4/18/17, 9:52:34 AM] Miller: but not a memorable line
[4/18/17, 9:52:35 AM] Miller: or verse
[4/18/17, 9:52:37 AM] Miller: or anything
[4/18/17, 9:52:58 AM] Miller: nothing thought provoking enough to stick in your brain
[4/18/17, 9:53:07 AM] Miller: and im not knocking you bc i dont have one either
[4/18/17, 9:54:04 AM] Donk: I just dont think its his style, hes a story teller
[4/18/17, 9:54:33 AM] Miller: because 3 years later i can tell you on the intro song to big seans dark sky paradise he said it took him 10 years to be an overnight success
[4/18/17, 9:54:53 AM] Miller: damn came out a week ago
[4/18/17, 9:54:57 AM] Miller: forget 3 years later
[4/18/17, 9:55:31 AM] Donk: Ok, and ghostface once rapped about a bagel with cream cheese on it
[4/18/17, 9:55:37 AM] Donk: Doesnt mean its great
[4/18/17, 9:56:43 AM] Donk: Its not a record that is going to spawn any top 40 hits
[4/18/17, 9:57:01 AM] Donk: But top 40 sucess has nothing to do with quality
[4/18/17, 9:57:28 AM] Miller: im not talking about record sales
[4/18/17, 9:57:36 AM] Dan Watts: üî•üî•üî•
[4/18/17, 9:58:03 AM] Miller: fwiw kendrick has the #2 charting song right now also btw
[4/18/17, 9:58:18 AM] Scott: 3 out of 5 fires watts?
[4/18/17, 9:59:40 AM] Dan Watts: Out of 10 flames!!!
[4/18/17, 10:00:01 AM] Miller: probably would still have more followers than my joe budden one lol
[4/18/17, 10:00:26 AM] Donk: I just looked st the hot 100 list, and damn i must be getting old since i didnt know at least half of the songs on ot
[4/18/17, 10:00:41 AM] Launchpad: leaving it up to the people to pick the most quality music is about as effective as leaving it up to the people to pick the best president
[4/18/17, 10:01:03 AM] Miller: like is kendrick a top 5 rapper rn? without a doubt, but his competition is complete trash
[4/18/17, 10:01:13 AM] Miller: it would be like putting mike dunleavy in a HS basketball game
[4/18/17, 10:01:17 AM] Miller: is he going to dominate? absolutely
[4/18/17, 10:01:43 AM] Launchpad: i bet you there is WAY better underground rap out there right now
[4/18/17, 10:02:10 AM] Miller: but b/c of all the hype and acclaim and people non-sarcastically calling him the GOAT im forced to go liking him and thinking his stuff is solid/good to backlashing and i end up being a hater
[4/18/17, 10:02:39 AM] Miller: (im sure these are the same morons who called views a classic 5 minutes after it came out)
[4/18/17, 10:02:44 AM] Donk: Yeah,  hes not the goat
[4/18/17, 10:02:57 AM] Donk: But hes probably the best doing it right now
[4/18/17, 10:03:02 AM] Miller: http://www.vladtv.com/article/226966/peter-rosenberg-calls-kendrick-lamar-the-greatest-rapper-ever
[4/18/17, 10:03:04 AM] Donk: Arguably anyway
[4/18/17, 10:03:08 AM] Miller: for sure
[4/18/17, 10:03:23 AM] Miller: i just think it says more about the other options than it does him
[4/18/17, 10:03:26 AM] Donk: Yeah, i heard that rhe other day, was over the top
[4/18/17, 10:04:17 AM] Miller: i was discussing this w/watts the other day but like top 5 rn Kendrick Drake big Sean J Cole and question mark?
[4/18/17, 10:04:29 AM] Miller: one of them doesnt rap (and when he does def doesnt write his own raps)
[4/18/17, 10:04:34 AM] Scott: Lil Dicky?
[4/18/17, 10:04:37 AM] Miller: and one of them has never made a very good album
[4/18/17, 10:04:52 AM] Miller: tbh LD aka the spacemans wife probably has as much a claim to that 5th spot as anyone else
[4/18/17, 10:05:06 AM] Donk: Dont forget chance
[4/18/17, 10:05:06 AM] Miller: seriously who else? future? lil uzi yach verty 21 savage? FOH
[4/18/17, 10:05:21 AM] Miller: i dont consider him a rapper but sure then he would be in that 5th spot by default
[4/18/17, 10:05:32 AM] Miller: (ironic considering his name being chance the rapper yes)
[4/18/17, 10:05:32 AM] Donk: Hes better than big sean
[4/18/17, 10:05:42 AM] Miller: hes certainly not a better RAPPER than big sean
[4/18/17, 10:05:56 AM] Miller: you can say he makes better music, thats debatable
[4/18/17, 10:06:01 AM] Donk: See, here we go again on what's a rapper or not
[4/18/17, 10:06:11 AM] Donk: Its the lauryn hill arguement all over again
[4/18/17, 10:06:12 AM] Miller: is drake a rapper?
[4/18/17, 10:06:19 AM] Miller: him and chance are the same thing
[4/18/17, 10:06:20 AM] Donk: If drake is, chance is
[4/18/17, 10:06:22 AM] Miller: sure
[4/18/17, 10:06:30 AM] Donk: And you put drake on the list
[4/18/17, 10:06:30 AM] Miller: i dont really consider either of them rappers
[4/18/17, 10:06:32 AM] Miller: thats fair
[4/18/17, 10:06:42 AM] Miller: big sean is also a better rapper than drake
[4/18/17, 10:06:52 AM] Miller: drake's body of work is much stronger
[4/18/17, 10:06:56 AM] Miller: and makes better music more consistently
[4/18/17, 10:07:06 AM] Donk: I disagree with that
[4/18/17, 10:07:11 AM] Donk: He has more music
[4/18/17, 10:07:20 AM] Donk: But not better music
[4/18/17, 10:07:31 AM] Miller: you disagree w/what?
[4/18/17, 10:07:48 AM] Donk: That drake makes better music more consistently
[4/18/17, 10:07:57 AM] Miller: than big sean?
[4/18/17, 10:08:05 AM] Donk: Than chance
[4/18/17, 10:08:37 AM] Miller: that wasnt my comparison but as someone who is not a fan of chance im not really able to speak on the issue unbiasedly
[4/18/17, 10:08:59 AM] Donk: Fair enough
[4/18/17, 10:09:59 AM] Donk: Going back to lil yachty, anytime i hear one of his verses,  it makes me think of what a snl skit would be making fun of rap
[4/18/17, 10:10:15 AM] Donk: But no, that's him seriously rapping
[4/18/17, 10:10:16 AM] Miller: im not entirely sure ive knowingly heard anything hes done
[4/18/17, 10:15:50 AM] Scott: donk
[4/18/17, 10:15:52 AM] Scott: hates rap music
[4/18/17, 10:15:55 AM] Scott: loves lil yachty
[4/18/17, 10:16:01 AM] Scott: so arrogant
[4/18/17, 10:16:29 AM] Donk: ?
[4/18/17, 10:47:55 AM] Miller: also i liked "FEEL" better when it was done 6 years ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xVEa0SMxFg
[4/18/17, 10:49:59 AM] Launchpad: put Foreign Beggers in that 5th spot
[4/18/17, 10:50:05 AM] Launchpad: shake things up a bit
[4/18/17, 10:50:26 AM] Miller: flatbush zombies?
[4/18/17, 10:50:29 AM] Miller: so wide open
[4/18/17, 10:52:29 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gk1ZE-ADvo randomly saw these guys at some festival or open for someone like 10 yrs ago, shocked they ended up having some reasonable amount of success
[4/18/17, 10:52:44 AM] Dan Watts: Lol I think foreign beggars were on a skrillex album back in the day
[4/18/17, 10:53:56 AM] Launchpad: Its actual rap at least https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y15axbKIiYQ

[4/18/17, 12:20:34 PM] Miller: Cleveland authorities hold a news conference after police say the suspect in the Facebook video murder case killed himself after a car chase in Pennsylvania.
[4/18/17, 12:21:50 PM] Launchpad: good that guy was a scumbag

[4/19/17, 2:11:10 PM] Miller: fml i just spent all day thinking today was tuesday
[4/19/17, 2:47:12 PM] Tk: Bill I'reilly finally booted from Fox.
[4/19/17, 2:47:34 PM] Miller: wonder how much his sexual harrasment severance package was?
[4/19/17, 2:47:37 PM] Miller: i think ailes got 40m/
[4/19/17, 2:47:46 PM] Miller: is 1x salary standard?
[4/19/17, 2:52:58 PM] Miller: i would agree w/all those points
[4/19/17, 2:53:17 PM] Miller: except for the conclusion
[4/19/17, 2:53:43 PM] Miller: considering weight watchers is basically a billion dollar company selling the idea of calorie counting so would millions of ppl
[4/19/17, 2:56:34 PM] Brian Katz: Don't you have to eat their food on weight watchers?
[4/19/17, 2:56:41 PM] Miller: no
[4/19/17, 2:56:50 PM] Miller: that was the old model
[4/19/17, 2:57:40 PM] Launchpad: how many calories does the human body need to consume to maintain weight?
[4/19/17, 2:57:45 PM] Launchpad: neither gain or lose weight
[4/19/17, 2:57:54 PM] Miller: 350
[4/19/17, 2:58:28 PM] Launchpad: so its a variable number...its different for each person?
[4/19/17, 3:03:39 PM] Miller: no
[4/19/17, 3:03:40 PM] Miller: 350
[4/19/17, 3:03:44 PM] Miller: for everyone
[4/19/17, 3:07:25 PM] Launchpad: of course...your calorie is the only thing that matters theory is coming into question and your only response is a self defensive troll
[4/19/17, 3:08:37 PM] Steve: Only took 13 million dollars and a phone call to HR
[4/19/17, 3:09:23 PM] Launchpad: so basically we know that maintenance weight is a different number for each person....probably not a big stretch to suggest that this number fluctuates within an individual, as they grow, gain/lose weight/muscle
[4/19/17, 3:09:40 PM] Miller: i shouldnt be surprised that you had completely the wrong takeaway from that picture katz sent
[4/19/17, 3:09:59 PM] Miller: print it out, take it home with you and try again tomorrow
[4/19/17, 3:10:34 PM] Launchpad: ok, explain the takeaway
[4/19/17, 3:11:07 PM] Miller: figure it out yourself, youre smart enough
[4/19/17, 3:11:10 PM] Miller: its less than a paragraph
[4/19/17, 3:11:18 PM] Miller: or dont
[4/19/17, 3:11:20 PM] Miller: i dont really care
[4/19/17, 3:11:54 PM] Launchpad: the takaway is that calorie counting (can be effective) but is difficult to manage accurately
[4/19/17, 3:12:35 PM] Miller: so its not making a conclusion on the effacy of it
[4/19/17, 3:12:42 PM] Miller: its saying it can be difficult
[4/19/17, 3:14:52 PM] Launchpad: well my own personal conclusion of calorie counting is that it works, but it isn't the only variable
[4/19/17, 3:15:04 PM] Miller: okay but thats not what this is saying
[4/19/17, 3:15:16 PM] Launchpad: for example -- the number of calories you need to eat to maintain your weight -- thats a variable
[4/19/17, 3:15:17 PM] Launchpad: that fluctuates
[4/19/17, 3:15:37 PM] Launchpad: I know that
[4/19/17, 3:15:39 PM] Miller: in my opinion then new kendrick lamar album is overrated
[4/19/17, 3:16:23 PM] Miller: i also cant figure out if this french election is going to matter for the markets
[4/19/17, 3:17:05 PM] Miller: similarly neither of these of course are conclusions i got from the picture katz
[4/19/17, 3:17:10 PM] Miller: sent
[4/19/17, 3:17:23 PM] Launchpad: but you always maintain that calories are the only thing that matters, and if you eat 2000 calories of taco bell a day and have alternative bouts of diarrhea, bloating and constipation, its exactly the same as eating 2000 calories of a well balanced wholesome meal
[4/19/17, 3:17:47 PM] Launchpad: Im not talking about the fucking katz picture
[4/19/17, 3:18:01 PM] Miller: and i have no interest in having a random nutrition debate w/you, theres literally thousands of peer reviewed studies confirming (what you consider MY) theory
[4/19/17, 3:18:05 PM] Miller: go read them
[4/19/17, 3:18:07 PM] Miller: or dont
[4/19/17, 3:18:11 PM] Miller: you obviously dont believe it
[4/19/17, 3:18:12 PM] Miller: so who cares
[4/19/17, 3:18:20 PM] Miller: do w/e you want
[4/19/17, 3:18:23 PM] Miller: eat chocolate all day
[4/19/17, 3:18:27 PM] Miller: eat only macademia nuts
[4/19/17, 3:18:29 PM] Miller: eat grass
[4/19/17, 3:18:33 PM] Miller: dont eat anything for 3 days
[4/19/17, 3:18:39 PM] Miller: your body your choice
[4/19/17, 3:18:54 PM] Launchpad: like I said, calorie counting works....but good luck getting to the gym everyday and exercising when you're eating taco bell everyday
[4/19/17, 3:19:01 PM] Miller: you lost 840lbs in 4 weeks so i think you know more about this anyone else and should continue doing w/e it is you do
[4/19/17, 3:19:13 PM] Steve: I only eat Taco Bell when I lose to watts and Miller at pong
[4/19/17, 3:19:44 PM] Steve: And then I end up buying @17189742074 a quesadilla
[4/19/17, 3:20:21 PM] Launchpad: no, I lost 840lbs and you discredit my results and said I could do the same if I just ate twinkies
[4/19/17, 3:20:44 PM] Launchpad: as if eating twinkies will make youre body feel good and motivate you to workout
[4/19/17, 3:21:07 PM] Miller: does smoking weed make you gain weight?
[4/19/17, 3:21:24 PM] Launchpad: not by iteself
[4/19/17, 3:21:28 PM] Miller: yes it does
[4/19/17, 3:21:30 PM] Miller: b/c it makes you eat
[4/19/17, 3:21:32 PM] Launchpad: if you get the munchies and eat out of control it does
[4/19/17, 3:21:33 PM] Miller: #launchpadlogic
[4/19/17, 3:21:40 PM] Miller: does walking kill you?
[4/19/17, 3:21:45 PM] Miller: you know how many poeple die walking a year?
[4/19/17, 3:21:46 PM] Miller: millions
[4/19/17, 3:21:58 PM] Miller: im out
[4/19/17, 3:28:54 PM] Steve: Wait, people die from walking?!
[4/19/17, 3:29:03 PM] Steve: I'm never walking again
[4/19/17, 3:29:03 PM] Steve: Can anyone pick me up from work?
[4/19/17, 3:29:34 PM] Brian Katz: Where do you think they came up with the phrase the walking dead?

[4/19/17, 5:50:23 PM] Steve: You aren't fighting crime
[4/19/17, 5:50:31 PM] Steve: You can't do anything super
[4/19/17, 5:50:36 PM] Dan Watts: it's definitely real
[4/19/17, 5:50:38 PM] Steve: Well, you are super annoying at times
[4/19/17, 5:50:45 PM] Steve: Maybe that's your power?
[4/19/17, 5:50:49 PM] Dan Watts: but theres a caveat
[4/19/17, 5:51:07 PM] Dan Watts: you get selected and you make their list and it is selective, HOWEVER they try to get you to buy advertising with them
[4/19/17, 5:51:31 PM] Steve: So it's like me getting selected to publishers clearing house
[4/19/17, 5:51:48 PM] Steve: And then telling me I'm rich already
[4/19/17, 5:51:54 PM] Launchpad: Eskimo SuperLawyer brothers üë©‚ÄçüöÄ
[4/19/17, 5:52:36 PM] Launchpad: no its like the whos who of america book that they put honor roll students in so you'd spend $40 to see your face in a fake yearbook
[4/19/17, 5:53:14 PM] Dan Watts: no it's not like that
[4/19/17, 5:53:14 PM] Steve: Damn
[4/19/17, 5:53:32 PM] Dan Watts: actually it's kind of similar
[4/19/17, 5:53:37 PM] Steve: Super lawyers unite!
[4/19/17, 5:53:39 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/19/17, 5:53:45 PM] Dan Watts: but only legit attorneys get selected

[4/19/17, 5:56:05 PM] Dan Watts: he has 50 verdicts of 1M+
[4/19/17, 5:56:34 PM] Dan Watts: so it's not the whos who of america who just takes any swinging dick who will pay to be in the book
[4/19/17, 5:56:37 PM] Launchpad: pretty super if you ask me
[4/19/17, 5:56:58 PM] Launchpad: nah they select you first, then you gotta pay up
[4/19/17, 5:57:37 PM] Dan Watts: you're still in superlawyers publication whether you pay up or not
[4/19/17, 5:57:56 PM] Dan Watts: you just have a more prominent space in their publication if you pay up
[4/19/17, 5:58:04 PM] Launchpad: same with whos who you just dont get to see the book
[4/19/17, 5:58:45 PM] Dan Watts: that's not true
[4/19/17, 5:59:17 PM] Dan Watts: and clearly this guy ben rubinowitz (hofstra law school btw) doesn't need to pay to be in a publication
[4/19/17, 5:59:17 PM] Steve: So basically you are both super lawyers

[4/19/17, 6:07:27 PM] Launchpad: so what was wrong with this basketball court??
[4/19/17, 6:07:43 PM] Launchpad: why aren't they suing the shoe company?
[4/19/17, 6:08:14 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/NaLvs2g1ADc?t=34 you can see the video of the incident
[4/19/17, 6:08:34 PM] Miller: thatrs a re-enactment
[4/19/17, 6:08:41 PM] Miller: but its essentially the same
[4/19/17, 6:09:15 PM] Miller: LD so hot he tore a guys ACL with his words

[4/19/17, 6:15:01 PM] Steve: Congrats?
[4/19/17, 6:15:05 PM] Launchpad: make us proud
[4/19/17, 6:15:24 PM] Steve: New title: super swiped
[4/19/17, 6:15:27 PM] Steve: *swiper
[4/19/17, 6:15:29 PM] Scott: No
[4/19/17, 6:15:33 PM] Scott: An attorney from court
[4/19/17, 6:15:37 PM] Miller: lol forgot about his swipe-athon
[4/19/17, 6:15:41 PM] Miller: how did that end up working out?
[4/19/17, 6:15:41 PM] Steve: Good move
[4/19/17, 6:15:48 PM] Scott: It's called real life guys. U know. When u talk to someone and ask them for their number in real life.
[4/19/17, 6:15:50 PM] Steve: Dating people you work with always works out
[4/19/17, 6:15:54 PM] Scott: U should try it. It's easier
[4/19/17, 6:15:56 PM] Launchpad: fyi swiping right on everyone DOES NOT HELP YOUR CHANCES OF MATCHING, it HURTS YOUR MATCHES
[4/19/17, 6:15:58 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/19/17, 6:16:05 PM] Scott: How so scottie
[4/19/17, 6:16:05 PM] Miller: lol cheese not content with just dating people he actually works with is now dating colleagues outside his work place
[4/19/17, 6:16:11 PM] Steve: Cheese lecturing me on picking up women
[4/19/17, 6:16:14 PM] Steve: I've reached hell
[4/19/17, 6:16:33 PM] Steve: It's dark and gloomy and I still work at people en espanol
[4/19/17, 6:16:35 PM] Miller: also you come at the king you best not miss nobody in the history of the world has dated more coworkers than steve
[4/19/17, 6:16:42 PM] Scott: True
[4/19/17, 6:16:50 PM] Launchpad: when you swipe right on everyone the Tinder algorithm flags you as an undesirable desperate loser and as a result shows you to less people
[4/19/17, 6:16:51 PM] Miller: well i should not say "dated"
[4/19/17, 6:16:57 PM] Scott: I'm still hooking up with this girl but I'm venturing outside
[4/19/17, 6:17:03 PM] Scott: How about on bumble scottie?
[4/19/17, 6:17:09 PM] Miller: lol damn tinder algorithim going HAM on you @16102201963
[4/19/17, 6:17:13 PM] Miller: you gonna take that?
[4/19/17, 6:17:14 PM] Launchpad: id imagine bumble is the same
[4/19/17, 6:17:18 PM] Scott: Damnit
[4/19/17, 6:17:26 PM] Miller: you got flagged as undesirable loser
[4/19/17, 6:17:29 PM] Miller: permanently
[4/19/17, 6:17:51 PM] Scott: Takes one to know one.
[4/19/17, 6:18:05 PM] Steve: Also, picking up someone you work with is not that impressive
[4/19/17, 6:18:06 PM] Miller: so the tinder algorthim is an undesirable loser?
[4/19/17, 6:18:08 PM] Miller: i guess
[4/19/17, 6:18:09 PM] Steve: And that's coming from me
[4/19/17, 6:18:18 PM] Scott: This girl I don't work with
[4/19/17, 6:18:27 PM] Steve: Is she a lawyer?
[4/19/17, 6:18:30 PM] Scott: Yes Miller that's my point
[4/19/17, 6:18:34 PM] Scott: She is a lawyer
[4/19/17, 6:18:35 PM] Steve: Was she in a courtroom?
[4/19/17, 6:18:38 PM] Scott: Yes

[4/19/17, 6:18:50 PM] Scott: This happened today
[4/19/17, 6:18:52 PM] Steve: Are you a lawyer?
[4/19/17, 6:18:55 PM] Scott: I am
[4/19/17, 6:18:59 PM] Steve: Sounds like a coworker
[4/19/17, 6:19:01 PM] Scott: I don't work with her
[4/19/17, 6:19:03 PM] Scott: She's not at my firn
[4/19/17, 6:19:05 PM] Scott: Firm
[4/19/17, 6:19:09 PM] Scott: So she's not my coworker
[4/19/17, 6:19:10 PM] Steve: Doesn't matter
[4/19/17, 6:19:14 PM] Scott: Right
[4/19/17, 6:19:17 PM] Steve: Is she a superlawyer?
[4/19/17, 6:19:22 PM] Scott: And all potatoes are French fries
[4/19/17, 6:19:29 PM] Steve: Is this the first time you've seen her?
[4/19/17, 6:19:30 PM] Scott: The mother of all arguments
[4/19/17, 6:19:39 PM] Scott: All potatoes are French fries
[4/19/17, 6:19:44 PM] Miller: is the only reason shes dating you b/c you are a superlawyer?
[4/19/17, 6:19:50 PM] Scott: Lol
[4/19/17, 6:19:52 PM] Scott: I can't even
[4/19/17, 6:20:04 PM] Steve: Is this the first time you've seen her?
[4/19/17, 6:20:07 PM] Dan Watts: Maybe we should scrap the tinder social group date idea
[4/19/17, 6:20:12 PM] Steve: Or do you see her fault regularly?
[4/19/17, 6:20:19 PM] Launchpad: i hope this is sarcasm
[4/19/17, 6:20:20 PM] Dan Watts: And just go out and pick up chicks mystery style
[4/19/17, 6:20:24 PM] Steve: *failry
[4/19/17, 6:20:31 PM] Scott: I've seen her a few times
[4/19/17, 6:20:32 PM] Miller: its not sarcasm
[4/19/17, 6:20:36 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/19/17, 6:20:38 PM] Steve: It's facts
[4/19/17, 6:20:40 PM] Scott: Not regularly
[4/19/17, 6:20:41 PM] Steve: Based on results
[4/19/17, 6:20:43 PM] Dan Watts: üé©
[4/19/17, 6:20:46 PM] Launchpad: lets do this in Austin so I can use my vacation pass
[4/19/17, 6:20:53 PM] Steve: Do what?
[4/19/17, 6:21:03 PM] Miller: yea this is not gonna end well for you
[4/19/17, 6:21:13 PM] Launchpad: And just go out and pick up chicks mystery style
[4/19/17, 6:21:41 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/19/17, 6:21:54 PM] Miller: ill place my bets on steve in normal clothes vs you in a feather boa and top hat
[4/19/17, 6:22:04 PM] Miller: issue is will i get anyone taking the other side
[4/19/17, 6:22:16 PM] Steve: I love how scott thinks because he picked up a 2 in Montreal that he's the new pickup artist
[4/19/17, 6:22:32 PM] Miller: canadian 2, you forgot about the exchange rate
[4/19/17, 6:22:47 PM] Steve: Is a New York 1/2?
[4/19/17, 6:22:49 PM] Launchpad: I love how you continually disrespect me even though you have no idea the girls I hook up with
[4/19/17, 6:22:51 PM] Miller: and forgot about one of the hansen brothers
[4/19/17, 6:22:55 PM] Dan Watts: Put some respek on LPs name
[4/19/17, 6:23:02 PM] Steve: I have an idea
[4/19/17, 6:23:06 PM] Steve: I saw her on Montreal
[4/19/17, 6:23:09 PM] Launchpad: I didn't hook up with this girl
[4/19/17, 6:23:14 PM] Steve: She wasn't anything to write home about
[4/19/17, 6:23:27 PM] Launchpad: you think thats the only girl I hooked up with?
[4/19/17, 6:23:38 PM] Steve: In Montreal? Yup
[4/19/17, 6:24:05 PM] Launchpad: yes in Montreal I hooked up with exactly 1 girl in 2 nights
[4/19/17, 6:24:20 PM] Launchpad: 3 if you count food poisoning night
[4/19/17, 6:24:20 PM] Miller: 3 nights?
[4/19/17, 6:24:32 PM] Scott: 3 nights
[4/19/17, 6:24:41 PM] Scott: Food poisoning night was a night.
[4/19/17, 6:24:43 PM] Miller: 1 night if you count KY breaking his ankle
[4/19/17, 6:24:51 PM] Miller: 0 nights if you count the night of the pub crawl
[4/19/17, 6:24:52 PM] Steve: That killed my bet really
[4/19/17, 6:24:56 PM] Scott: Lol
[4/19/17, 6:24:58 PM] Steve: And KY's ankle
[4/19/17, 6:25:37 PM] Steve: Damn you Kiyoon!
[4/19/17, 6:26:05 PM] Launchpad: Ive hooked up with more girls in the last year then I ever have but only Dan knows this cause hes in Super Smash Brothers chat that humble Steve refuses to join
[4/19/17, 6:26:12 PM] Launchpad: hes not a team player
[4/19/17, 6:26:39 PM] Steve: I'm sure you have scott
[4/19/17, 6:26:40 PM] Launchpad: us brothers in -kai- will share an effective text messages if it gets a girl wet
[4/19/17, 6:27:00 PM] Steve: I'm not doubting your last year
[4/19/17, 6:27:07 PM] Steve: From all accounts you've done well
[4/19/17, 6:27:13 PM] Steve: I just like larger sample sizes
[4/19/17, 6:27:18 PM] Steve: Like the last 10 years
[4/19/17, 6:27:21 PM] Steve: For example
[4/19/17, 6:27:48 PM] Launchpad: you mean when I was in a relationship for 6.5 years...
[4/19/17, 6:28:00 PM] Steve: Sounds like a personal problem
[4/19/17, 6:28:11 PM] Steve: I was also in about 4 relationships
[4/19/17, 6:28:15 PM] Steve: Excuses?
[4/19/17, 6:28:38 PM] Launchpad: excuses? I don't even know what we're arguing about
[4/19/17, 6:28:53 PM] Steve: That you aren't better at picking up women
[4/19/17, 6:29:00 PM] Steve: Did we lose you that quickly?
[4/19/17, 6:29:02 PM] Steve: Shit
[4/19/17, 6:29:16 PM] Launchpad: still debatable
[4/19/17, 6:29:24 PM] Steve: Lol ok
[4/19/17, 6:29:32 PM] Steve: That's fine
[4/19/17, 6:29:33 PM] Launchpad: and you were hitting on that same drunk MTL girl
[4/19/17, 6:29:34 PM] Steve: You win
[4/19/17, 6:29:37 PM] Steve: You are better
[4/19/17, 6:29:40 PM] Steve: I was not
[4/19/17, 6:29:57 PM] Steve: I was only talking to her because she was on the bar crawl
[4/19/17, 6:29:58 PM] Launchpad: clearly this is a argument based on nothing
[4/19/17, 6:30:03 PM] Steve: Big difference
[4/19/17, 6:30:06 PM] Launchpad: we don't have any data to back this up
[4/19/17, 6:30:22 PM] Steve: I mean, I have people who have witnessed
[4/19/17, 6:30:25 PM] Steve: You have you
[4/19/17, 6:30:29 PM] Steve: And your brother
[4/19/17, 6:30:36 PM] Steve: Who I'm sure is unbiased
[4/19/17, 6:30:36 PM] Launchpad: i live in another state bro...
[4/19/17, 6:30:53 PM] Steve: Is that another excuse?
[4/19/17, 6:32:03 PM] Launchpad: you dont make any sense
[4/19/17, 6:32:27 PM] Steve: Never do
[4/19/17, 6:33:44 PM] Launchpad: i don't know what my brother has to do with anything
[4/19/17, 6:34:22 PM] Steve: Because he lives with you
[4/19/17, 6:39:18 PM] Brian Katz: Congrats to Watts and Cheese being super lawyers!
Scotty you've done well for yourself this last year. Be humble and a dick about things and people will stop hating. 
Steve stop hating. Lol
[4/19/17, 6:39:31 PM] Brian Katz: Not*
[4/19/17, 6:39:58 PM] Dan Watts: The humble dick approach is the way to go
[4/19/17, 6:41:00 PM] Miller: Bitch be humble, sit down
[4/19/17, 6:43:45 PM] Launchpad: üíØ
[4/19/17, 6:49:25 PM] Steve: Lol

[4/19/17, 9:40:31 PM] Steve: I'm not defending anything
[4/19/17, 9:40:41 PM] Steve: I had sex with kat
[4/19/17, 9:40:47 PM] Steve: End of story
[4/19/17, 9:41:01 PM] Launchpad: lol I blacked that out for about 12 years, thanks herman
[4/19/17, 9:41:30 PM] Launchpad: have not thought about that a single time until you just brought that up
[4/19/17, 9:42:00 PM] Steve: And who wanted to fuck rich Jones' girl or friend?
[4/19/17, 9:42:03 PM] Justin: You're welcome. I remember because rich jones girl threatened to cut my dick off, pretty memorable
[4/19/17, 9:42:32 PM] Justin: Probably Tk and lp...at least lp
[4/19/17, 9:43:33 PM] Justin: Tk gonna...

[4/19/17, 10:36:36 PM] Dan Watts: #facts
[4/19/17, 10:58:41 PM] Scott: That went well
[4/19/17, 11:12:02 PM] Tk: Plead the fif!!
[4/20/17, 7:50:15 AM] Kiyoon: You gotta hit the gym cheese, or at least do some pushups
[4/20/17, 8:03:13 AM] Steve: Yo, how about we shoot a superlawyers commercial?
[4/20/17, 8:03:18 AM] Steve: I'll shoot and edit
[4/20/17, 8:03:25 AM] Steve: Just need the superlawyers to agree
[4/20/17, 9:04:00 AM] Miller: he needs to find out from @16316620763 how many pushups he needs to do at his bodyweight in order to get his bench up
[4/20/17, 9:08:24 AM] Kiyoon: lolol
[4/20/17, 9:08:32 AM] Dan Watts: I'm down for a commercial.
[4/20/17, 9:08:42 AM] Dan Watts: Lights camera action baby
[4/20/17, 9:09:00 AM] Miller: watts has commercial experience already
[4/20/17, 9:09:01 AM] Miller: probably gets top billing
[4/20/17, 9:09:11 AM] Steve: I will not pay you
[4/20/17, 9:09:16 AM] Steve: I'll buy you four nuggets
[4/20/17, 9:09:24 AM] Miller: as his lawyer we will take it
[4/20/17, 9:09:36 AM] Steve: God I love bird law
[4/20/17, 9:10:05 AM] Justin: Should be shot better call Saul black and white style.
[4/20/17, 9:10:15 AM] Steve: I just need cheese to agree
[4/20/17, 9:10:22 AM] Steve: I can edit that afterwards
[4/20/17, 9:10:59 AM] Miller: yea im sure the guy who is afraid to put a picture of himself on facebook or put his name down for an airbnb will willingly let you film him
[4/20/17, 9:11:01 AM] Miller: seems likely
[4/20/17, 9:11:21 AM] Steve: Who knows
[4/20/17, 9:11:29 AM] Steve: If he has final editing say
[4/20/17, 9:12:03 AM] Justin: Hes gonna make you sign a 20 page waiver.
[4/20/17, 9:12:26 AM] Miller: in the end no matter what happens with the commercial hes gonna own abuelas house
[4/20/17, 9:13:36 AM] Steve: Well that's impossible
[4/20/17, 9:13:39 AM] Steve: She'll never sign
[4/20/17, 9:19:45 AM] Brian Katz: Abuela will make grilled cheese
[4/20/17, 9:20:54 AM] Steve: Eat him for breakfast and then feed his sausage fingers to the opossums
[4/20/17, 9:21:00 AM] Steve: Too much?
[4/20/17, 9:23:18 AM] Brian Katz: No way, were talking abuela here
[4/20/17, 10:03:25 AM] Brian Katz: That's one game
[4/20/17, 10:03:26 AM] Launchpad: the last guy was probably a knick
[4/20/17, 10:03:45 AM] Brian Katz: You'd have to be in the playoffs for that Scotty
[4/20/17, 10:04:12 AM] Miller: lol im just fucking around
[4/20/17, 10:04:21 AM] Miller: he still finished +11 and the bench was -64 i think?
[4/20/17, 10:04:30 AM] Miller: its unreal, that team would not win 5 games w/o him
[4/20/17, 10:08:11 AM] Launchpad: well yeah the last guy was 20 seasons ago
[4/20/17, 10:09:34 AM] Brian Katz: lol Starks in the finals for sure
[4/20/17, 10:09:38 AM] Brian Katz: Game 7
[4/20/17, 10:12:24 AM] Steve: But James harden should be the MVP lol
[4/20/17, 10:13:16 AM] Miller: i mean idk enough about it, i dont follow the NBA closely enough but plenty of smart basketball ppl say he should be so ill take their word for it
[4/20/17, 10:15:09 AM] Launchpad: by the way this work from home thing is fucken great
[4/20/17, 10:15:13 AM] Launchpad: 420 today

[4/20/17, 10:51:44 AM] Brian Katz: Severino and pineda look good, Bullpen strong, bats are a cracking! And those Mets don't seem to have the same na na they had the last two years.
[4/20/17, 10:52:26 AM] Miller: sure
[4/20/17, 10:52:47 AM] Miller: i think i read a fangraphs article the other day talking about the mets decrease in na na
[4/20/17, 10:52:58 AM] Brian Katz: You too?
[4/20/17, 10:54:41 AM] Steve: It's an epidemic going around
[4/20/17, 10:54:56 AM] Steve: A lot less na na for everyone in the corona, queens area
[4/20/17, 10:55:03 AM] Steve: Also known as corona, Long Island
[4/20/17, 10:56:36 AM] Brian Katz: The Mets  are drastically low on na na
[4/20/17, 11:05:27 AM] Miller: Report: O'Reilly getting 'tens of millions' in Fox severance
[4/20/17, 11:19:06 AM] Miller: http://gizmodo.com/the-new-rick-and-morty-vr-game-is-just-great-1794488714?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow @16318489683 gonna buy an oculus now
[4/20/17, 11:22:51 AM] Brian Katz: Nah vr sucks
[4/20/17, 11:26:10 AM] Dan Watts: Pacers about to get a W tonight
[4/20/17, 11:30:17 AM] Launchpad: The PlayStation VR is sick.  I had no expectations for it and it blew me away
[4/20/17, 11:31:47 AM] Brian Katz: I've literally heard no good things about the PlayStation VR
[4/20/17, 11:32:00 AM] Launchpad: Resident Evil 7?
[4/20/17, 11:32:31 AM] Brian Katz: Heard it was okay with the vr
[4/20/17, 11:32:40 AM] Brian Katz: Just as good with out
[4/20/17, 11:34:10 AM] Miller: ive actually heard nothing but good things about psvr
[4/20/17, 12:59:02 PM] Launchpad: Sick
[4/20/17, 12:59:42 PM] Launchpad: He's doing that for character/ endorsement deals
[4/20/17, 1:01:42 PM] Miller: you know who that is?
[4/20/17, 1:03:11 PM] Dan Watts: google image searching hard right now
[4/20/17, 1:04:24 PM] Miller: figure being out in west coast theres a chance you knew it but was a setup for a punch line on duct tape
[4/20/17, 1:04:46 PM] Miller: .......na it was a setup that no non-baseball fans know who that is bc he doesnt do any endorsement deals
[4/20/17, 1:05:58 PM] Miller: weirdly i look down on bumgarner for being married to this woman but i respect kershaw for being married to a relatively attractive but certainly not supermodel wife
[4/20/17, 1:06:14 PM] Miller: (also kershaw is a cool dude and bumgarner is a douche)
[4/20/17, 1:06:44 PM] Launchpad: maybe she was once hot but got fat being a millionaire useless housewife
[4/20/17, 1:07:27 PM] Dan Watts: kershaw fucks with jesus heavy
[4/20/17, 1:07:35 PM] Miller: does he?
[4/20/17, 1:08:10 PM] Miller: its weird bc im not very religous myself, and i generally dislike super religous jews (and mostly super religous people to be fair) but i do like religous athletes
[4/20/17, 1:08:30 PM] Miller: makes sense, guy like spends his offseasons building homes in 3rd world countires
[4/20/17, 1:08:49 PM] Dan Watts: Kershaw and his wife, Ellen, co-authored a book named Arise: Live Out Your Faith and Dreams on Whatever Field You Find Yourself about their Christian faith and their humanitarian efforts. The book was released on January 10, 2012 through Regal Press
[4/20/17, 1:09:23 PM] Miller: hes one of my favorite athletes of any sport
[4/20/17, 1:09:43 PM] Miller: im continously amazed how under the radar he flys while basically statistically being the lebron james of baseball
[4/20/17, 1:19:06 PM] Dan Watts: thats true, and he's in LA which is a huge market
[4/20/17, 1:31:09 PM] Launchpad: 5 of 5 üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
[4/20/17, 1:37:24 PM] Dan Watts: AB apparently was dating some chick (also hot) for 6 years, they have 2 kids together and 1 on the way, and he bounced on her for this chick
[4/20/17, 1:38:00 PM] Dan Watts: shes def üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•/5 flames
[4/20/17, 2:23:36 PM] Miller: looks like anyone standing next to you tbh
[4/20/17, 2:23:48 PM] Scott: Huh
[4/20/17, 2:23:51 PM] Scott: That makes no sense
[4/20/17, 9:50:21 PM] Donk: Lol pacers
[4/20/17, 9:50:38 PM] Donk: 26pt lead, cant even hold it
[4/20/17, 9:51:13 PM] Miller: Only saving grace was he wasn't popping off when they had that big lead
[4/20/17, 9:51:58 PM] Donk: Still has been dead wrong
[4/20/17, 9:56:00 PM] Dan Watts: Down 200 in vegas but winning life on a daily basis
[4/20/17, 9:56:28 PM] Scott: üôåüèª
[4/20/17, 9:58:13 PM] Dan Watts: Dead wrong is a stretch
[4/20/17, 9:58:21 PM] Dan Watts: Pacers should be up 2-1
[4/20/17, 9:58:29 PM] Donk: How so?

[4/21/17, 11:39:35 AM] Miller: wonder if they still have a chance

[4/21/17, 12:07:00 PM] Brian Katz: *"struggling"
[4/21/17, 12:07:39 PM] Dan Watts: the average margin of win has been like 3 games
[4/21/17, 12:07:41 PM] Dan Watts: 3 points
[4/21/17, 12:08:20 PM] Dan Watts: pacers covered 2 of 3 games, ironically they didnt cover the game they were winning by 26 poitns

[4/21/17, 3:21:12 PM] Dan Watts: at the outset these groups of girls suck so far
[4/21/17, 3:21:26 PM] Dan Watts: i'd say 75% are pairs, we need 3
[4/21/17, 3:21:47 PM] Scott: i have a good 3 im swiping right on when i get my swipes back in t-minus 40 minutes

[4/21/17, 3:43:49 PM] Dan Watts: @15165329107 may need to step up and take alejandro

[4/21/17, 4:13:24 PM] Miller: no cheating and using calculators or shit
[4/21/17, 4:13:31 PM] Miller: have to take your word for it
[4/21/17, 4:25:41 PM] Launchpad: Anyone want to set the under/ over line?
[4/21/17, 4:32:16 PM] Launchpad: no guesses?
[4/21/17, 4:32:25 PM] Dan Watts: 32
[4/21/17, 4:32:42 PM] Dan Watts: i'd take over
[4/21/17, 4:33:24 PM] Dan Watts: its not a hard test at all, the timing is what makes it difficult
[4/21/17, 4:34:32 PM] Miller: Anything less than a 50 is embarrassing tbh
[4/21/17, 4:35:02 PM] Launchpad: First time taking it, while dropping a duece
[4/21/17, 4:35:26 PM] Donk: 12 min deuce?
[4/21/17, 4:35:29 PM] Donk: Thats serious
[4/21/17, 4:35:34 PM] Miller: Barely beat fournette smh
[4/21/17, 4:36:01 PM] Launchpad: Spent too much time in the begining and ran out of time around question 42/43.  Now that I know the test entails, I bet I can probably avg 38-40
[4/21/17, 4:42:21 PM] Dan Watts: i should work in vegas the way i set that o/u tbh
[4/21/17, 4:43:12 PM] Dan Watts: Luck got 38
[4/21/17, 4:43:22 PM] Launchpad: when you're on the clock, every deuce is 12 minutes
[4/21/17, 4:43:36 PM] Launchpad: I could definitely get a 38 if I were to do it again
[4/21/17, 4:44:06 PM] Miller: That's what fournette said also
[4/21/17, 4:45:05 PM] Launchpad: I bet he did
[4/21/17, 4:45:13 PM] Launchpad: probably also his first time even looking at it...

[4/21/17, 5:05:20 PM] Brian Katz: So lame
[4/21/17, 5:05:55 PM] Miller: I admit this was my first thought when I saw that headline
[4/21/17, 5:23:41 PM] Justin: Miller why did t you post the Harvard study which proved sanders has higher levels of support among blacks and Hispanics than whites. Alongside the idea Tom Perez, then secretary of labor, orchestrated the Bernie bro slogan/ campaign you watts and company so gleefully bought into.
[4/21/17, 5:24:40 PM] Miller: Too bad that support didn't translate into votes
[4/21/17, 5:25:12 PM] Justin: Too bad it was also a marketing gimmick which effected real voting
[4/21/17, 5:25:39 PM] Justin: But yeh tracing results after a corrupt process makes sense
[4/21/17, 5:29:59 PM] Justin: Also not gonna blindly defend Bernie, I know nothing of the candidate. Just figured like a good time considering how "brainwashed " Bernie bros were over the anti Clinton propaganda campaign to point out some hypocrisy.
[4/21/17, 5:32:38 PM] Justin: Bernie is after all touring the country with Perez after Perez created the Bernie bro slogan, so it's not exactly like Bernie is an infallible idol
[4/21/17, 5:33:22 PM] Justin: https://www.facebook.com/TheYoungTurks/videos/10154581376304205/
[4/21/17, 5:33:26 PM] Justin: For some laughs
[4/21/17, 5:34:06 PM] Justin: Last 2 minutes pretty golden as he advertises his own brazillian nuts campaign  by taking his pants off
[4/21/17, 5:36:21 PM] Steve: @16318489683 worst nightmare just came true

[4/22/17, 8:28:24 AM] Brian Katz: How did your date go btw?
[4/22/17, 8:30:05 AM] Scott: Not bad  probably will see her again. Just two different ppl even though both lawyers  so long term who knows.
[4/22/17, 8:30:37 AM] Brian Katz: That's good though, you just looking to savage her then?
[4/22/17, 8:35:32 AM] Scott: Haha I realized when I was out with her that I see her more often than I thought. So yea but I can't be a complete putz about it.
[4/22/17, 9:17:23 AM] Steve: Congrats to all you boys for the weight loss

[4/23/17, 3:36:00 PM] Donk: I was way off giving them a 25% chance to win more than 1 game
[4/23/17, 3:36:31 PM] Brian Katz: Betting against Lebron in the the east, liketheguy would ever drop a first round game, stop it
[4/23/17, 4:21:24 PM] Miller: Le pen and macron it is
[4/23/17, 4:21:31 PM] Miller: Best case scenario relatively speaking
[4/23/17, 4:55:58 PM] Steve: Hopefully the latest terror attack doesn't sway the voters in the wrong direction
[4/23/17, 4:57:08 PM] Miller: Already gave her about a half a point boost but if these runoff polls are remotely accurate she has basically no chance
[4/23/17, 4:57:36 PM] Steve: Let's hope they are
[4/23/17, 4:57:46 PM] Steve: Have you ever seen video of her father?
[4/23/17, 4:57:54 PM] Steve: It's basically trump on steroids
[4/23/17, 4:57:55 PM] Miller: I have not
[4/23/17, 4:58:07 PM] Miller: Don't know much about her or any of the candidates
[4/23/17, 5:07:19 PM] Dan Watts: @19732079889 @16318489683 I'll never avoid accountability. You both didn't really go on a limb but I have to respectfully bow to you both
[4/23/17, 5:07:39 PM] Steve: Fuck that shit watts
[4/23/17, 5:07:44 PM] Steve: Fight the man!
[4/23/17, 5:08:56 PM] Miller: Idk katz def did, cavs up 1 0 coming off a 1 possession win calling a sweep is definitely worse than 1 1 odds
[4/23/17, 5:09:18 PM] Dan Watts: I'll take that bet every time
[4/23/17, 5:10:01 PM] Dan Watts: Someone was talking about the trump election and him being down 75-25, and the analyst was like 25% comes up more than your think
[4/23/17, 5:10:05 PM] Dan Watts: Same thing here
[4/23/17, 5:30:09 PM] Brian Katz: Hasn't the French people elected the white flag every election since 1940?
[4/23/17, 5:31:15 PM] Miller: But saying she has a 25 percent chance is very different than saying she's expected to get 25 percent of the vote
[4/23/17, 5:37:57 PM] Justin: Yeh trump starts with 46% vote at bottom end
[4/23/17, 5:39:05 PM] Justin: Pretty sure she has no chance but who knows.
[4/23/17, 5:42:25 PM] Justin: But it's funny you bring up white flag katz. I thought about that when I was in Paris. Pretty much they said no to Iraq war-a position viewed as correct by like 90% of Americans at this point yet we still think they are pussies
[4/23/17, 6:05:13 PM] Dan Watts: Wasn't making correlation to French election, just talking about my own loss
[4/24/17, 7:28:13 AM] Miller: Happy birthday again @16102201963

[4/24/17, 12:26:58 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/24/17, 12:27:12 PM] Steve: Hey cheese, she move out yet?
[4/24/17, 12:27:26 PM] Scott: Rhetorical question
[4/24/17, 12:27:28 PM] Scott: Lol
[4/24/17, 12:27:35 PM] Steve: #notworthit
[4/24/17, 12:28:08 PM] Scott: We shall see...im still dating at the same time anyway.
[4/24/17, 12:28:24 PM] Steve: Who did you have birthday sex with?
[4/24/17, 12:28:25 PM] Miller: lol how is that a rhetorical question
[4/24/17, 12:28:37 PM] Steve: And I'm sure she took you out to dinner, right?
[4/24/17, 12:28:37 PM] Scott: With her
[4/24/17, 12:28:40 PM] Scott: The girl from work
[4/24/17, 12:28:46 PM] Scott: Nope.
[4/24/17, 12:28:58 PM] Steve: So it was just straight sex and then she bounced?
[4/24/17, 12:29:05 PM] Scott: She came over I poured a glass of wine barely took two sips hooked up and had sex for like 4 hours and that was it.
[4/24/17, 12:29:16 PM] Steve: And she bounced?
[4/24/17, 12:29:30 PM] Scott: Yeah
[4/24/17, 12:29:41 PM] Scott: Was over afternoon into the evening
[4/24/17, 12:29:45 PM] Launchpad: 17 years later, he finally becomes a man üòÇ
[4/24/17, 12:29:51 PM] Steve: That's a little better
[4/24/17, 12:30:14 PM] Miller: of all people never thought cheese would be a homewrecker
[4/24/17, 12:30:26 PM] Launchpad: ?
[4/24/17, 12:30:32 PM] Launchpad: does she have a bf?
[4/24/17, 12:30:33 PM] Scott: She's in love with me...what can I say. Lol
[4/24/17, 12:30:33 PM] Miller: wait until the rabbis hear about this, gonna get a 2nd roast
[4/24/17, 12:30:35 PM] Steve: She's got a man who she lives with
[4/24/17, 12:30:49 PM] Launchpad: lmao
[4/24/17, 12:30:54 PM] Launchpad: wow
[4/24/17, 12:30:59 PM] Steve: And cheese gave her an ultimatum and then still sleeps with her and hangs out
[4/24/17, 12:31:01 PM] Steve: But he's fine
[4/24/17, 12:31:04 PM] Steve: Everything is fine
[4/24/17, 12:31:06 PM] Scott: She lives with a guy for the time being. Their relationship is in the shitter. I'm just doing me
[4/24/17, 12:31:10 PM] Steve: Can I get a house fire meme?
[4/24/17, 12:31:24 PM] Launchpad: ultimatum??
[4/24/17, 12:31:28 PM] Launchpad: those usually dont work out
[4/24/17, 12:31:33 PM] Scott: Haha the ultimatum ends in 2 weeks when there are literally zero excuses left and I'm done but still hanging anyway
[4/24/17, 12:31:38 PM] Scott: Banging
[4/24/17, 12:31:44 PM] Steve: Well in this case they aren't working either
[4/24/17, 12:31:46 PM] Steve: Clearly
[4/24/17, 12:31:56 PM] Scott: She's as close to a 10 as I've ever seen I'm okay with sleeping with her right now.
[4/24/17, 12:31:58 PM] Steve: That's what cheese said last week
[4/24/17, 12:32:00 PM] Launchpad: whats the ultimatum
[4/24/17, 12:32:04 PM] Scott: And we'll c eventually I'll cut thus off
[4/24/17, 12:32:15 PM] Steve: Right
[4/24/17, 12:32:59 PM] Scott: Sex was pretty nuts. But I'll cut it off at some point.
[4/24/17, 12:33:11 PM] Scott: Time indeterminate
[4/24/17, 12:33:26 PM] Steve: Right
[4/24/17, 12:33:38 PM] Scott: K.
[4/24/17, 12:33:56 PM] Launchpad: why?
[4/24/17, 12:34:09 PM] Scott: Emotionally I can't do this much longer.
[4/24/17, 12:34:14 PM] Scott: Or so I've said.
[4/24/17, 12:34:45 PM] Steve: Miller def saw watts and I at the top of his home wrecker list
[4/24/17, 12:34:56 PM] Steve: Now cheese is top on that draft board
[4/24/17, 12:34:56 PM] Scott: Flip it upside down
[4/24/17, 12:35:17 PM] Steve: Pretty much the only draft board where he is the number one pick
[4/24/17, 12:35:18 PM] Scott: Cheese 2.0? I hope not for so long.
[4/24/17, 12:35:31 PM] Scott: Not true
[4/24/17, 12:35:40 PM] Steve: And insanely large hands
[4/24/17, 12:35:44 PM] Scott: On the draft board of awesomeness I'm number 1
[4/24/17, 12:35:57 PM] Scott: Rest of u are 2nd round picks
[4/24/17, 12:36:03 PM] Scott: üé§
[4/24/17, 12:36:14 PM] Steve: Weak
[4/24/17, 12:36:31 PM] Steve: #sticktohomewrecking
[4/24/17, 12:36:45 PM] Scott: I don't like being that guy. Damn.
[4/24/17, 12:39:23 PM] Launchpad: you're forgetting someone
[4/24/17, 12:40:46 PM] Scott: U?
[4/24/17, 12:42:15 PM] Launchpad: si
[4/24/17, 12:44:09 PM] Steve: Are you though?
[4/24/17, 12:44:31 PM] Steve: Have you dated women with a BF/husband?
[4/24/17, 12:44:47 PM] Launchpad: I banged a girl I met at a club a month ago who had a boyfriend
[4/24/17, 12:45:00 PM] Steve: Then you are also a home wrecker
[4/24/17, 12:45:18 PM] Launchpad: then they broke up 'unrelated to me' ...sure...now they're back together
[4/24/17, 12:45:31 PM] Launchpad: home disruptor?
[4/24/17, 12:46:07 PM] Donk: Cheese trying to wife this girl?
[4/24/17, 12:46:27 PM] Donk: Otherwise who cares if she has a bf?
[4/24/17, 12:47:46 PM] Kiyoon: Cheese def trying to wife this girl up
[4/24/17, 12:49:15 PM] Miller: easy for me to say on account i havent been single since before facebook was invented but seems like bad karma, also too old for that kind of drama
[4/24/17, 12:50:15 PM] Steve: He is def trying to wife up
[4/24/17, 12:52:55 PM] Miller: thats the other issue, good luck ever trusting that person considering how you met
[4/24/17, 12:54:21 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese cut this chick off and move to the next, and become a true "stickman"
[4/24/17, 1:02:09 PM] Launchpad: even the nicest most innocent girl will cheat if shes in a bad relationshpu
[4/24/17, 1:02:42 PM] Launchpad: the way to prevent your girl from cheating -- is being so fucken awesome its not even a thought in her mind
[4/24/17, 1:03:20 PM] Kiyoon: think its about being awesome together
[4/24/17, 1:03:35 PM] Launchpad: of course
[4/24/17, 1:03:58 PM] Launchpad: but if you're worried your girl is cheating, you should be worrying that you're not awesome enough
[4/24/17, 1:04:14 PM] Miller: üôÑ
[4/24/17, 1:04:24 PM] Miller: hope thats an eye roll
[4/24/17, 1:04:25 PM] Miller: cant really tell
[4/24/17, 1:04:39 PM] Donk: Yeah, imo you just have to assume that if a girl cheated on her bf with you, that she will cheat on you too
[4/24/17, 1:05:01 PM] Launchpad: maybe
[4/24/17, 1:06:11 PM] Launchpad: but if shes cheating, chances are shes missing something in the relationship that you're not providing
[4/24/17, 1:06:49 PM] Donk: Agreed
[4/24/17, 1:07:09 PM] Donk: But once a cheater...
[4/24/17, 1:08:26 PM] Miller: crazy idea is dont date people who are immature enough to handle their relationships in that manner
[4/24/17, 1:08:38 PM] Miller: not happy in a relationship? try to fix it or leave
[4/24/17, 1:10:48 PM] Launchpad: there was a really great line - I think it was from Californication -- where Marcy says to Charlie after his new gf was cheating on him "You are so the kind of guy this stuff happens to"
[4/24/17, 1:11:20 PM] Launchpad: the idea being that if you are a loser who doesn't command respect, girls will cheat on you
[4/24/17, 1:11:25 PM] Miller: sure
[4/24/17, 1:11:35 PM] Miller: and if you dress a certain way you will get raped
[4/24/17, 1:11:42 PM] Donk: Girls dont cheat on guys with high t levels
[4/24/17, 1:11:48 PM] Miller: no chance bro
[4/24/17, 1:11:55 PM] Miller: look at that girl that cheated on war machine
[4/24/17, 1:11:59 PM] Miller: she got what was coming to her
[4/24/17, 1:12:05 PM] Miller: amirite?
[4/24/17, 1:13:21 PM] Launchpad: no
[4/24/17, 1:13:42 PM] Launchpad: I didn't say beat the shit out of the girl if she cheats
[4/24/17, 1:14:06 PM] Launchpad: suffice to say, that guy is a loser and will be spending a long time in jail
[4/24/17, 1:14:16 PM] Justin: so if you used your hall pass, is it cheating?
[4/24/17, 1:14:23 PM] Miller: loser? bet that guys next gf wont cheat on him bc she now knows how awesome he is
[4/24/17, 1:14:24 PM] Launchpad: no
[4/24/17, 1:14:30 PM] Justin: why not?
[4/24/17, 1:14:40 PM] Justin: is your grilfreind not awesome enough?>
[4/24/17, 1:14:42 PM] Launchpad: that guy was insecure as fuck
[4/24/17, 1:15:36 PM] Launchpad: no but I give her the best dick
[4/24/17, 1:15:48 PM] Launchpad: I've incentivized her not to cheat
[4/24/17, 1:15:55 PM] Justin: ok has she incentivized you?
[4/24/17, 1:16:17 PM] Launchpad: yeah she empties my load every day
[4/24/17, 1:16:29 PM] Justin: so would you use hall pass?
[4/24/17, 1:16:38 PM] Launchpad: sure
[4/24/17, 1:16:47 PM] Justin: which clearly indicates your logic is flawed
[4/24/17, 1:16:58 PM] Kiyoon: lol
[4/24/17, 1:17:01 PM] Justin: you are satisfied, she is satisfied but all ti takes is permissiona nd you will fuck another girl
[4/24/17, 1:16:59 PM] Launchpad: Im different
[4/24/17, 1:17:04 PM] Launchpad: I don't really care about mongomy
[4/24/17, 1:17:21 PM] Justin: because there is no awesome link to getting laid and relationships
[4/24/17, 1:17:23 PM] Launchpad: of course, cause I have a different perspective on seduction
[4/24/17, 1:18:03 PM] Launchpad: & monogomy
[4/24/17, 1:18:26 PM] Justin: cealry there is apyschological baggage and ideas of human nature involved in cheating, but int hose cases "being awesome" isnt the answer
[4/24/17, 1:22:30 PM] Launchpad: what do you mean
[4/24/17, 1:23:05 PM] Launchpad: I think there is pyschological baggage in the idea of being cheating on to some people is a fate worse than death
[4/24/17, 1:24:24 PM] Launchpad: if you're not making your girl cum, she will cheat on you, because she deserves someone who will
[4/24/17, 1:24:53 PM] Justin: lol
[4/24/17, 1:25:26 PM] Justin: you are making the assumption that all human interaction revolves around cumming and you dont realize how terrible an oversimplification that is
[4/24/17, 1:26:05 PM] Launchpad: no im making the assumption that if you can't make your girl cum, she will find someone who will
[4/24/17, 1:26:13 PM] Launchpad: otherwise, you two are just friends
[4/24/17, 1:26:18 PM] Justin: even if i grant you that assumption(which is asinine)... how many times does she have to cum? when does she need to cum? Is she cumming enough when she cums?
[4/24/17, 1:26:33 PM] Justin: i mean its such a stupid oversimplification
[4/24/17, 1:26:35 PM] Launchpad: those are questions for her
[4/24/17, 1:26:36 PM] Miller: literally as stupid as if you dont have hair your girl will cheat on you, she deserves someone who has hair
[4/24/17, 1:26:48 PM] Launchpad: no
[4/24/17, 1:27:08 PM] Justin: but those quesrtions show, she could be cumming and still cheat
[4/24/17, 1:27:10 PM] Justin: .....
[4/24/17, 1:27:29 PM] Sean: @16195657200 you've got this all wrong my dude
[4/24/17, 1:27:33 PM] Brian Katz: Girls I hear dig the long ball. So if you don't swing for the fences they out?
[4/24/17, 1:27:52 PM] Launchpad: I dont think I have this wrong at all
[4/24/17, 1:28:04 PM] Launchpad: I think I'm realistic
[4/24/17, 1:28:23 PM] Launchpad: you guys think loyalty is something you're entitled to, and not something you gotta earn
[4/24/17, 1:28:34 PM] Justin: and you earn it by cum...i get it
[4/24/17, 1:28:34 PM] Brian Katz: I think there's way more to it than cumming Scotty
[4/24/17, 1:28:52 PM] Sean: You can't seriously think that loyalty comes from an orgasm?
[4/24/17, 1:29:41 PM] Dan Watts: Just catching up on this. Cheese has MAD feelings for this girl. He got it he got it bad
[4/24/17, 1:29:58 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/24/17, 1:30:01 PM] Sean: If you're with a girl who cheats and is not a swinger or in an open relationship she is just a shitty person
[4/24/17, 1:30:02 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/24/17, 1:30:06 PM] Steve: Schechter is proving me right
[4/24/17, 1:30:06 PM] Dan Watts: Definitely in marvins room
[4/24/17, 1:30:09 PM] Steve: It's amazing
[4/24/17, 1:30:28 PM] Steve: #seanfacts
[4/24/17, 1:30:32 PM] Steve: Also the truth
[4/24/17, 1:30:33 PM] Miller: hes right
[4/24/17, 1:30:39 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[4/24/17, 1:30:56 PM] Steve: But LP is dead wrong and is over simplifying life
[4/24/17, 1:31:25 PM] Miller: or maybe your brain is not awesome enough to comprehend it
[4/24/17, 1:31:31 PM] Miller: which is really on you tbh
[4/24/17, 1:31:37 PM] Steve: That's probably what it is
[4/24/17, 1:32:07 PM] Sean: Plenty of people have shitty relationships in the bed room or not satisfying enough, and decide to open up there relationship for sex. Still remain very loyal and honest with each other even though they're not making each other orgasm
[4/24/17, 1:32:41 PM] Sean: Whole thing is just dumb. You make it seem bc you don't believe in misogamy that you have the right to be an awful human being
[4/24/17, 1:33:20 PM] Launchpad: what makes me aweful?
[4/24/17, 1:33:46 PM] Miller: your spelling rn
[4/24/17, 1:33:46 PM] Sean: I'm also not trying to sound like a dick here but I have fucked 100x the people you have in a life time and let me tell you #TheseHoesAintLoyal
[4/24/17, 1:33:49 PM] Brian Katz: Chicks dig scars I hear
[4/24/17, 1:34:21 PM] Launchpad: how many?
[4/24/17, 1:34:25 PM] Sean: You just tried justifying a women cheating on her man bc he can't make her cum so bitches need to go out and find you so they can come
[4/24/17, 1:34:27 PM] Steve: You aren't awful
[4/24/17, 1:34:33 PM] Steve: You just don't seem to get it
[4/24/17, 1:34:42 PM] Sean: I wasn't saying you I'm saying you justified women cheating
[4/24/17, 1:34:43 PM] Steve: But hopefully one day you will
[4/24/17, 1:34:45 PM] Steve: Or not
[4/24/17, 1:34:50 PM] Steve: Probably not
[4/24/17, 1:35:11 PM] Brian Katz: Chicks dig flashy cars too
[4/24/17, 1:35:13 PM] Dan Watts: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nwyjxsOYnys
[4/24/17, 1:35:16 PM] Launchpad: in some cases...I am not saying its right...Im saying thats why it happens
[4/24/17, 1:35:28 PM] Steve: It still doesn't justify cheating
[4/24/17, 1:35:39 PM] Steve: Regardless of whether it happens or not
[4/24/17, 1:35:43 PM] Launchpad: neither does you existing justify loyalty
[4/24/17, 1:35:46 PM] Steve: A real woman would try to work it out
[4/24/17, 1:35:54 PM] Launchpad: you need to keep her happy & satisfied
[4/24/17, 1:35:54 PM] Steve: And explain to the man what he could do better
[4/24/17, 1:35:59 PM] Steve: Not just cheat
[4/24/17, 1:36:03 PM] Sean: She can leave!
[4/24/17, 1:36:07 PM] Launchpad: And a real man will make his woman cum
[4/24/17, 1:36:08 PM] Miller: yea bro you dont make enough $ to be keeping her in designer shit? she gonna go looking for someone who will
[4/24/17, 1:36:08 PM] Sean: Welcome to America
[4/24/17, 1:36:13 PM] Sean: That's not true
[4/24/17, 1:36:30 PM] Sean: If you think being able to make someone else orgasm makes you a man
[4/24/17, 1:36:33 PM] Sean: That's crazy
[4/24/17, 1:36:35 PM] Launchpad: not all chicks dig flashy calls
[4/24/17, 1:36:39 PM] Launchpad: **cars
[4/24/17, 1:36:59 PM] Sean: So you only became a man when you started fucking??
[4/24/17, 1:37:22 PM] Brian Katz: I hear chicks dig musicians
[4/24/17, 1:37:23 PM] Kiyoon: and not all women just want to cum man
[4/24/17, 1:37:39 PM] Kiyoon: women get satisfaction outside the bedroom
[4/24/17, 1:37:53 PM] Dan Watts: That Colombian chick I dated would not allow penetration until she came first either by oral or manual. Shit got very annoying very fast
[4/24/17, 1:37:53 PM] Brian Katz: They love brunch bro
[4/24/17, 1:37:55 PM] Launchpad: I didn't say thats the only thing you have to do
[4/24/17, 1:37:56 PM] Kiyoon: for the most part, I would think satisfaction in the bedroom is like the 3,4,5th most important thing
[4/24/17, 1:38:03 PM] Justin: the idea of monagamy is fervently ingrained into women's heads through nature and culture and to ignore all those societal and evolutionary characteristics and say cumming equals satisfaction- is dumb dumb
[4/24/17, 1:38:18 PM] Launchpad: did I say that?
[4/24/17, 1:38:28 PM] Justin: well you are sayign cheating = not cumming
[4/24/17, 1:38:33 PM] Launchpad: you're talking about cheating...which is fucking
[4/24/17, 1:38:37 PM] Launchpad: so Im talking about fucking
[4/24/17, 1:38:44 PM] Sean: What?!
[4/24/17, 1:38:47 PM] Launchpad: fuck your girlfriend right and she wont cheat
[4/24/17, 1:38:55 PM] Sean: That's not true
[4/24/17, 1:38:55 PM] Kiyoon: lol
[4/24/17, 1:38:59 PM] Miller: ill take dumb things said today for $300
[4/24/17, 1:39:05 PM] Justin: ok im done being trolled on this topic
[4/24/17, 1:39:09 PM] Sean: If you're dating a shitty person who wants to act like a whore she will cheat
[4/24/17, 1:39:10 PM] Brian Katz: Chicks love flowers
[4/24/17, 1:39:19 PM] Launchpad: this is not troling
[4/24/17, 1:39:24 PM] Miller: you should write a book @16195657200
[4/24/17, 1:39:33 PM] Sean: There is plenty of women out there who are not having good sex and decide to stay in there marriage and not act like a whore
[4/24/17, 1:39:33 PM] Miller: REAL MANZ guide to not being cheated on like a cuck bitch
[4/24/17, 1:39:37 PM] Miller: will be a short book obviously
[4/24/17, 1:39:59 PM] Brian Katz: On page it reads make her cum, mic drop book out
[4/24/17, 1:39:59 PM] Launchpad: why is this hard?
[4/24/17, 1:40:05 PM] Brian Katz: One*
[4/24/17, 1:40:10 PM] Miller: maybe an ebook would be better
[4/24/17, 1:40:13 PM] Sean: Bc your justifying cheating
[4/24/17, 1:40:17 PM] Launchpad: you think girls have magical signs over their heads which label them cheaters or faithful?
[4/24/17, 1:40:31 PM] Launchpad: Im not justifying cheating -- Im telling you why it happens
[4/24/17, 1:40:36 PM] Launchpad: #fact
[4/24/17, 1:40:39 PM] Brian Katz: Or a tweet miller, it's less than 160 characteristics
[4/24/17, 1:40:46 PM] Justin: funny danielle feels same way about men
[4/24/17, 1:40:48 PM] Launchpad: oh wait...she only cheats cause shes a whore
[4/24/17, 1:40:57 PM] Sean: Yeah
[4/24/17, 1:41:02 PM] Justin: you two should discuss, steve give dnaielle LP number
[4/24/17, 1:41:10 PM] Miller: cheese get her in the chat
[4/24/17, 1:41:17 PM] Sean: ‚úåüèº
[4/24/17, 1:41:28 PM] Launchpad: only whores cheat, and they carry around signs with them that tell you if they're a cheating whore or so so you now whether or not you should be in a relathionship
[4/24/17, 1:41:54 PM] Miller: well one way to tell is if she is currently cheating on someone when you first hook up w/her
[4/24/17, 1:42:04 PM] Sean: Obviously if you think the girl is single that's not on you, but you made it seem earlier that you had no problem fucking a girl looking for dick regardless
[4/24/17, 1:42:04 PM] Miller: probably dont need a written sign for that one
[4/24/17, 1:42:09 PM] Launchpad: if you can't satisfy your woman sexually, it very much increases the probability that she cheats
[4/24/17, 1:42:26 PM] Sean: Yea bc she is a whore
[4/24/17, 1:42:34 PM] Sean: Or a coward
[4/24/17, 1:42:39 PM] Sean: And should just leave her man
[4/24/17, 1:42:39 PM] Miller: or immature
[4/24/17, 1:42:40 PM] Brian Katz: No way, if you make 100k a month it greatly drops that
[4/24/17, 1:42:45 PM] Miller: or has other emotional problems
[4/24/17, 1:43:05 PM] Sean: Fair points or those reasons as well
[4/24/17, 1:43:11 PM] Launchpad: I would prefer if she didn't have a bf, as Im not looking for drama -- but if shes cheating, I don't know the dynamics of the relationship or not
[4/24/17, 1:43:20 PM] Launchpad: technically, Cheese is married and fucking another girl...so....
[4/24/17, 1:43:21 PM] Sean: Haha who cares
[4/24/17, 1:43:25 PM] Sean: Cheating is cheating
[4/24/17, 1:43:25 PM] Brian Katz: Bitches are only loyal to the $$$. Your dick ain't every going to keep her icy
[4/24/17, 1:43:38 PM] Launchpad: not true
[4/24/17, 1:44:19 PM] Launchpad: girls will cheat on guys that make a lot of money, cause often times those guys are arrogant, selfish, only look out for themselves, and think their money is everything
[4/24/17, 1:44:23 PM] Justin: this is much closer
[4/24/17, 1:44:29 PM] Brian Katz: Donk stop what's up app calling me lol
[4/24/17, 1:44:48 PM] Justin: if you had led with if a women isnt sexually staisfied ...it INCREASES the chance she will cheat...sure
[4/24/17, 1:44:50 PM] Miller: as the good prophet kanye once said "you gon be hot a little while imma be rich forever"
[4/24/17, 1:45:06 PM] Brian Katz: Truth
[4/24/17, 1:45:09 PM] Donk: Ha, sorry, phone is going crazy
[4/24/17, 1:45:34 PM] Launchpad: except when hes asking mark z to lend him money üòÇ
[4/24/17, 1:45:45 PM] Brian Katz: Women ain't trying to go hungry LP, wealth stops cheating
[4/24/17, 1:45:54 PM] Launchpad: and whats the difference from what I said?
[4/24/17, 1:46:19 PM] Miller: b/c one is a relative basis
[4/24/17, 1:46:28 PM] Launchpad: I didn't say cheating is right, but I implied that some guys deserve to get cheated on if they don't satisfy their women and don't care to
[4/24/17, 1:46:30 PM] Miller: if youre bald it INCREASES the chances she will cheat
[4/24/17, 1:46:44 PM] Miller: if you are poor it INCREASES the chances she will cheat
[4/24/17, 1:46:58 PM] Miller: if you are fat it INCREASES the chances she will cheat
[4/24/17, 1:47:00 PM] Miller: etc.. etc...
[4/24/17, 1:47:11 PM] Miller: those are all relative statements
[4/24/17, 1:47:17 PM] Miller: there is a big difference
[4/24/17, 1:49:24 PM] Launchpad: if you are fat, bald & poor, the likelihood of you getting cheated on significantly decreases if you can satisfy your women in bed
[4/24/17, 1:49:32 PM] Launchpad: not rocket science
[4/24/17, 1:49:42 PM] Justin: lol
[4/24/17, 1:49:52 PM] Miller: how much does it decrease by?
[4/24/17, 1:49:55 PM] Justin: so physical appearance and welath are valued less than cumming
[4/24/17, 1:50:02 PM] Launchpad: and saying that women only care about money is misogynist
[4/24/17, 1:50:02 PM] Miller: wondering what you consider statistically significant
[4/24/17, 1:50:20 PM] Steve: Women care about many different things
[4/24/17, 1:50:27 PM] Launchpad: of course
[4/24/17, 1:50:33 PM] Steve: Not just cumming, wealth and appearance
[4/24/17, 1:50:39 PM] Steve: Unless she is a whore
[4/24/17, 1:50:45 PM] Steve: Then she is only interested in that
[4/24/17, 1:50:49 PM] Steve: Or a gold digger
[4/24/17, 1:51:55 PM] Launchpad: what makes a girl a whore?
[4/24/17, 1:52:22 PM] Steve: A girl that will cheat on you because you are not having good sex, you are "poor" or aren't the best looking
[4/24/17, 1:52:28 PM] Steve: She should break up with Yoh
[4/24/17, 1:52:30 PM] Steve: *you
[4/24/17, 1:52:35 PM] Steve: Or just never have dated you
[4/24/17, 1:52:41 PM] Steve: By date you and chest
[4/24/17, 1:52:44 PM] Steve: *cheat
[4/24/17, 1:53:29 PM] Steve: Especially if the girls doesn't make an effort to help you be better
[4/24/17, 1:53:41 PM] Steve: With the sex in particular
[4/24/17, 1:54:16 PM] Steve: Not every woman is the same and  they get pleasure in different ways
[4/24/17, 1:54:31 PM] Steve: It's not like one size fits all
[4/24/17, 1:56:03 PM] Justin: not true jackhammer= no cheating
[4/24/17, 1:57:47 PM] Steve: Or better put, on move fits all
[4/24/17, 1:57:53 PM] Steve: *one
[4/24/17, 1:58:14 PM] Justin: chicken dance?
[4/24/17, 1:58:34 PM] Justin: chicken wing*
[4/24/17, 1:58:36 PM] Steve: Even that doesn't work on all
[4/24/17, 1:58:41 PM] Steve: It's efficient though
[4/24/17, 1:58:46 PM] Justin: but high propability
[4/24/17, 1:59:03 PM] Steve: Until they realize I'm poor, then they cheat
[4/24/17, 1:59:09 PM] Steve: #LPlogic
[4/24/17, 2:18:19 PM] Launchpad: and they are miserable
[4/24/17, 2:18:42 PM] Launchpad: did I ever say that?
[4/24/17, 2:19:32 PM] Launchpad: Its almost comical how you guys completely misinterpret
[4/24/17, 2:19:50 PM] Launchpad: Miller seems to think Im ok with guys beating the shit out of girls
[4/24/17, 2:20:27 PM] Launchpad: Steve thinks I think you only need one magical move to satisfy every girl
[4/24/17, 2:20:37 PM] Launchpad: known to herman as the jackhammer
[4/24/17, 2:20:59 PM] Brian Katz: Girls love big balls I hear
[4/24/17, 2:21:10 PM] Justin: its funny how we amke one line jokes after presenting logical arguments and you present them strawmanning our entire argument
[4/24/17, 2:21:51 PM] Launchpad: what is your logical argument? that not all girls cheat?
[4/24/17, 2:22:08 PM] Justin: no that cumming isnt the predominant factor in why women cheat
[4/24/17, 2:22:37 PM] Justin: and that even if women are cumming they are probbaly almost as likely to cheat
[4/24/17, 2:23:05 PM] Justin: if you wnat to dig deeper, if sexual satisfaction is the predominant factor ina  relationship, it is extrememly likely that a woman will cheat
[4/24/17, 2:23:06 PM] Steve: That's not what I'm saying at all
[4/24/17, 2:23:14 PM] Steve: You clearly have some reading comprehension issues
[4/24/17, 2:23:44 PM] Steve: My point with the one move fits all is that sex with any partner takes time to develop
[4/24/17, 2:23:58 PM] Steve: You don't just jump into bed and know that the other person likes
[4/24/17, 2:25:10 PM] Sean: Also bc a guy has a big dick means absolutely nothing
[4/24/17, 2:25:35 PM] Launchpad: I never suggested thats all a guy needs
[4/24/17, 2:27:04 PM] Steve: You keep telling us what you haven't said
[4/24/17, 2:27:17 PM] Steve: But all I've heard you actually said was women cheat because their men are bad in bed
[4/24/17, 2:27:23 PM] Launchpad: of course sex better as you become more familiar with someone, I wouldn't claim otherwise.
[4/24/17, 2:27:36 PM] Steve: Which is oversimplifying the issues
[4/24/17, 2:28:23 PM] Steve: If a woman truly cares and wants to make the relationship work, she won't just cheat
[4/24/17, 2:28:28 PM] Steve: She'll try to work it out
[4/24/17, 2:28:38 PM] Steve: If she doesn't, she'll use it as an excuse
[4/24/17, 2:32:07 PM] Launchpad: You guys are wrongly oversimplifying everything I say by turning it into a binary / black & white statement.  And always works out that way in group chat
[4/24/17, 2:32:35 PM] Launchpad: great sex is a major part of being awesome...but not everything
[4/24/17, 2:32:39 PM] Steve: Again, that is ou oversimplifying
[4/24/17, 2:32:42 PM] Steve: Not us
[4/24/17, 2:33:04 PM] Steve: Yea^agreed
[4/24/17, 2:34:05 PM] Launchpad: but, if you, as a man, ignore the issues in your relationship and aren't making your girl happy, it will make her much more likely to cheat
[4/24/17, 2:34:15 PM] Steve: Agreed
[4/24/17, 2:34:26 PM] Steve: That is not what we're were arguing he entire time
[4/24/17, 2:34:41 PM] Steve: We all agreed that you not bein a good boyfriend will make your girlfriend more likely to cheat
[4/24/17, 2:35:05 PM] Steve: But that's not what you said originally or what you maintained throughout most of the discussion
[4/24/17, 2:35:19 PM] Launchpad: whats your point? If she cheats shes a whore?
[4/24/17, 2:35:25 PM] Launchpad: she should want to work things out with you first? Who says she hasn't?
[4/24/17, 2:35:41 PM] Steve: My point is if your boyfriend sucks, break up
[4/24/17, 2:35:47 PM] Steve: No reason to ever cheat
[4/24/17, 2:35:57 PM] Sean: I have never agreed with Stephen more
[4/24/17, 2:36:00 PM] Sean: üôåüèª
[4/24/17, 2:36:05 PM] Steve: Period
[4/24/17, 2:36:20 PM] Steve: If he sucks in bed, and you've tried to work it out, break up
[4/24/17, 2:37:43 PM] Launchpad: easier said than done...what if shes living with him?
[4/24/17, 2:37:52 PM] Steve: If she decides not to try and work it out and just incessantly cheats, then yes, she (as well as any man who does the same) is a whore. Men also need to try and work things out without resorting to cheating.
[4/24/17, 2:37:55 PM] Sean: Not his ducking problem
[4/24/17, 2:37:58 PM] Launchpad: Again, Im not saying its right - Im being real about it
[4/24/17, 2:38:00 PM] Steve: Sure, life is hard scott
[4/24/17, 2:38:05 PM] Steve: Situations vary
[4/24/17, 2:38:17 PM] Steve: Still doesn't make it ok to cheat because you are living with a guy who sucks
[4/24/17, 2:38:27 PM] Launchpad: you expect women to behave ideally, the reality is that not all of them will
[4/24/17, 2:38:28 PM] Steve: Beak up and then eventually move out
[4/24/17, 2:38:47 PM] Steve: I expect people to be courteous after a certain age
[4/24/17, 2:39:00 PM] Steve: And by that I mean at least break up with a person who you don't want to be wth
[4/24/17, 2:39:02 PM] Sean: Especially sharing a home
[4/24/17, 2:39:09 PM] Steve: Don't keep them around because it's easy
[4/24/17, 2:39:13 PM] Steve: Or it's convenient
[4/24/17, 2:39:41 PM] Steve: We all have made mistakes in relationships but at a certain age you should be past that
[4/24/17, 2:39:55 PM] Launchpad: yet many woman can't be bothered to send you a text before they flake on a date
[4/24/17, 2:40:06 PM] Steve: And men do the same
[4/24/17, 2:40:09 PM] Steve: It's not just women
[4/24/17, 2:40:13 PM] Brian Katz: Damn he's still tight over that chick lol
[4/24/17, 2:40:15 PM] Sean: What?!
[4/24/17, 2:40:19 PM] Steve: Shit, I know people in this chat who have flaked on dates
[4/24/17, 2:40:28 PM] Miller: maybe youre just not being awesome enough for them to value you enough to text you before they flake
[4/24/17, 2:40:32 PM] Miller: ever consider that?
[4/24/17, 2:40:41 PM] Steve: You also have to move on pat that one chic
[4/24/17, 2:40:45 PM] Launchpad: yes
[4/24/17, 2:40:48 PM] Steve: *past
[4/24/17, 2:40:50 PM] Steve: It's over
[4/24/17, 2:40:50 PM] Launchpad: of course
[4/24/17, 2:40:53 PM] Steve: She's gone
[4/24/17, 2:41:17 PM] Launchpad: Im being a realist and recognizing what happens in relationships
[4/24/17, 2:41:43 PM] Launchpad: lol Im not obsessing over one chick
[4/24/17, 2:42:28 PM] Steve: Slightly
[4/24/17, 2:43:16 PM] Launchpad: no Im not
[4/24/17, 2:43:21 PM] Steve: And you aren't a realist you have cynical view
[4/24/17, 2:43:38 PM] Steve: Which is probably based off of your relationships
[4/24/17, 2:43:43 PM] Steve: Like all of us
[4/24/17, 2:43:49 PM] Launchpad: not really
[4/24/17, 2:43:54 PM] Miller: i mean maybe if your e-game was better bitches wouldnt be flaking on you
[4/24/17, 2:43:55 PM] Launchpad: its not cynical
[4/24/17, 2:44:18 PM] Launchpad: that is a true statement
[4/24/17, 2:44:26 PM] Miller: i think its your fault if poeple do not treat you with common courtesy or decency
[4/24/17, 2:44:36 PM] Launchpad: except people do
[4/24/17, 2:44:47 PM] Launchpad: but I don't tolerate it if they don't
[4/24/17, 2:46:04 PM] Steve: You have tolerated me for a while
[4/24/17, 2:46:27 PM] Launchpad: Im just trying to put balance to the perspective that girls own you loyalty and you don't need to constantly earn it
[4/24/17, 2:46:52 PM] Steve: Huh?
[4/24/17, 2:47:03 PM] Miller: its not about owing someone something, its about treating people with respect, which is something everyone should do
[4/24/17, 2:47:18 PM] Launchpad: *** that girls don't owe you loyalty
[4/24/17, 2:47:24 PM] Launchpad: of course
[4/24/17, 2:47:29 PM] Miller: despite what neil strauss may think its not a "game"
[4/24/17, 2:47:38 PM] Launchpad: and if you stop doing that to her in the relationship, she'll be tempted to cheat
[4/24/17, 2:47:55 PM] Steve: Couldn't agree with @15166335046 more
[4/24/17, 2:48:33 PM] Launchpad: including if you don't respect her sexual needs -- it will get  old if you blow your load and roll over and go to sleep without satisfying her
[4/24/17, 2:49:24 PM] Steve: We'll all know that being selfish in bed is not good scott
[4/24/17, 2:49:32 PM] Brian Katz: Respect is earned through orgasms
[4/24/17, 2:49:34 PM] Steve: You are literally telling us all what we already know
[4/24/17, 2:49:55 PM] Launchpad: lol.  funny as a joke...but its true though
[4/24/17, 2:50:50 PM] Miller: realistically speaking the easiest way to stop a woman from cheating on you is find her when she is cheating, hit her over the head with your club, and drag her back to your cave
[4/24/17, 2:50:55 PM] Steve: Don't know if I've ever had a bigger headache in my life
[4/24/17, 2:51:23 PM] Launchpad: then why are you disagreeing with me?
[4/24/17, 2:51:32 PM] Steve: And then sew her vagina shut
[4/24/17, 2:51:37 PM] Steve: Don't forget that part
[4/24/17, 2:51:45 PM] Steve: Because that's not what you said before
[4/24/17, 2:52:04 PM] Steve: You said "a women cheat because you aren't giving her orgasms"
[4/24/17, 2:52:24 PM] Launchpad: please highlight that exact quote
[4/24/17, 2:54:09 PM] Steve: if you're not making your girl cum, she will cheat on you, because she deserves someone who will
[4/24/17, 2:54:14 PM] Steve: ^exact quote
[4/24/17, 2:54:24 PM] Steve: I'll get other instances if that doesn't suffice
[4/24/17, 2:54:47 PM] Steve: Because you said it several times
[4/24/17, 2:55:58 PM] Launchpad: ok, I said this exactly. Because I think women deserve good sex
[4/24/17, 2:56:13 PM] Steve: Great
[4/24/17, 2:56:22 PM] Steve: But do you realize that is oversimplifying it?
[4/24/17, 2:56:38 PM] Launchpad: sure
[4/24/17, 2:56:52 PM] Launchpad: but whats the problem, why are you so offended by that statement
[4/24/17, 2:57:03 PM] Steve: I'm not offended at all
[4/24/17, 2:57:43 PM] Steve: I just think it's a bit obtuse
[4/24/17, 2:57:47 PM] Steve: That's all
[4/24/17, 2:58:07 PM] Steve: You are smarter than that
[4/24/17, 2:58:09 PM] Steve: Basically
[4/24/17, 3:00:13 PM] Launchpad: let me rephrase that in a less oversimplified manner "if you're not making your girl cum, it will significantly increase the likelihood that she will cheat on you, because you don't care enough about her pleasure"
[4/24/17, 3:01:01 PM] Steve: Again, if she has tried to work on it, then she should just break up with that guy
[4/24/17, 3:01:05 PM] Steve: Rather than cheat
[4/24/17, 3:01:10 PM] Brian Katz: Unless you're filthy rich
[4/24/17, 3:01:19 PM] Miller: still didnt answer me, what is "significant" in this case?
[4/24/17, 3:01:48 PM] Launchpad: greater than 10%
[4/24/17, 3:04:06 PM] Miller: there is a 12% increase in her cheating chances if you are bald though
[4/24/17, 3:04:51 PM] Brian Katz: Or short
[4/24/17, 3:04:59 PM] Brian Katz: Women dig tall guys
[4/24/17, 3:05:07 PM] Miller: that number increases to 17% if you had hair when you met and then proceeded to lose it over the course of the relationship
[4/24/17, 3:05:46 PM] Launchpad: Now YOU are oversimplifying things  - yes she should try to work on it (and I never implied that she has or hasn't in my hypothetical case).  But, here's the (generalized most of the time true) reality:
Woman want a man who is a MAN.  A man who takes charge, is a leader, decisive - that stuff turns a woman on.  If a man can't satisfy her in bad, that is a major turn off.  She might try to work with you, but expecting her to tell you that your bad in bed puts her in an uncomfortable position
[4/24/17, 3:05:51 PM] Brian Katz: Women hate short bald guys
[4/24/17, 3:06:04 PM] Launchpad: unless you are awesome
[4/24/17, 3:06:38 PM] Brian Katz: Nah it's like cumming, 100% hate short bald guys
[4/24/17, 3:07:00 PM] Launchpad: unless that short bald guys got confidence and can back it up
[4/24/17, 3:07:08 PM] Miller: i checked the math, @16318489683 is right
[4/24/17, 3:07:10 PM] Brian Katz: Nah 100%
[4/24/17, 3:07:27 PM] Miller: i have a spreadsheet i can send you if you want
[4/24/17, 3:08:26 PM] Brian Katz: Your short to bald ratio can effect how much she cheats in you I hear. Miller can pull up the graph if necessary
[4/24/17, 3:08:53 PM] Launchpad: I don't know why this is freaking you guys out
[4/24/17, 3:08:57 PM] Miller: its simple you just enter your height, salary, weight, dick size, awesomeness and baldness level and it calculates the likelihood of you being cheated on
[4/24/17, 3:09:03 PM] Launchpad: why you feel the need to get defensive
[4/24/17, 3:09:31 PM] Miller: pointing out logistical flaws with your statements is not being defensive
[4/24/17, 3:09:35 PM] Launchpad: all of these things are irrelevant if you know how to really satisfy a woman (including in bed)
[4/24/17, 3:09:46 PM] Miller: although anytime i do that i do get labeled a "hater" so sure, w/e, i am a defensive hater
[4/24/17, 3:09:57 PM] Launchpad: what is the logistical flaw in my statements?
[4/24/17, 3:10:07 PM] Miller: that one
[4/24/17, 3:10:34 PM] Miller: and that guys still got some of his hair, and hes super rich
[4/24/17, 3:10:46 PM] Brian Katz: Won multiple WS
[4/24/17, 3:11:09 PM] Brian Katz: His wife is good looking, but she should be way hotter
[4/24/17, 3:11:13 PM] Justin: https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&hl=en-us&q=salman+rushdie&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijjcTq5b3TAhWE4CYKHVg1DxIQBQgWKAA&biw=414&bih=628
[4/24/17, 3:11:17 PM] Dan Watts: jason statham is killing it
[4/24/17, 3:11:29 PM] Justin: Look at this guys ex wives and tell me woman are singleminded.
[4/24/17, 3:11:46 PM] Launchpad: how is that statement flawed...what your telling me is that you need status to keep a woman happy. Sounds mysoginistic
[4/24/17, 3:12:08 PM] Miller: b/c you made a completely baseless generalization of an entire gender?
[4/24/17, 3:12:09 PM] Dan Watts: that dude married PADMA?
[4/24/17, 3:13:13 PM] Miller: what about women who are asexual? is being good in bed the only thing they care about?
[4/24/17, 3:13:18 PM] Miller: what about women post-menopause?
[4/24/17, 3:14:46 PM] Miller: its mind bottling you dont realize making a sweeping generalization of a very complex subject is inherently wrong
[4/24/17, 3:15:11 PM] Justin: Apprently he oversexed her -complete opposite of lp argument
[4/24/17, 3:15:33 PM] Steve: You clearly down understand what oversimplifying means
[4/24/17, 3:15:35 PM] Steve: I'm done
[4/24/17, 3:15:38 PM] Steve: You win LP
[4/24/17, 3:27:37 PM] Launchpad: it says women 'prefer' - not that they exclusively date
[4/24/17, 3:28:27 PM] Launchpad: you're talking about 1% of the population, and that more than likely 1% of the population that no one in group chat wants to date
[4/24/17, 3:31:53 PM] Launchpad: you've been way to quiet during all of this
[4/24/17, 3:33:11 PM] Dan Watts: making $
[4/24/17, 3:33:59 PM] Dan Watts: i've got a lot failed relationships under my belt, not one to be giving advice
[4/24/17, 3:36:38 PM] Launchpad: here's the premise of the last two hours: these guys seem to take offense to me pointing out the fact that girls will cheat if you can't satisfy them in bed
[4/24/17, 3:36:57 PM] Launchpad: its not rocket science
[4/24/17, 3:39:39 PM] Dan Watts: sure but isn't the more likely scenario an adjustment to the agreement e.g. open relationship or a decision to break up
[4/24/17, 3:41:17 PM] Launchpad: that forces her into making a difficult decision
[4/24/17, 3:42:41 PM] Launchpad: one that is easily avoided by cheating
[4/24/17, 3:43:09 PM] Launchpad: we already know that many women can be bothered with the inconvenience of messaging you before flaking on you
[4/24/17, 3:44:14 PM] Launchpad: you think she wants to readily admit you suck in bed and are not satisfying her? Sure she may break up with you -- but I doubt shes going to suggest an open relationship out of nowhere
[4/24/17, 3:46:29 PM] Brian Katz: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/science-backed-qualities-in-men-women-like-2016-5
[4/24/17, 3:47:40 PM] Brian Katz: No where in this article do they mention awesomeness or making them cum lol
[4/24/17, 3:48:06 PM] Miller: thats b/c business insider is fake news
[4/24/17, 3:48:20 PM] Miller: you need to look at awesomebroswithhightlevelsinsider.com
[4/24/17, 3:48:37 PM] Launchpad: maybe try asking women?
[4/24/17, 3:49:54 PM] Miller: look everything i need to know about keeping women happy i learned here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcdgExRatrA
[4/24/17, 3:49:58 PM] Brian Katz: https://www.google.com/amp/www.menshealth.com/sex-women/top-20-traits-she-wants%3Famp
[4/24/17, 3:50:01 PM] Scott: Wow I missed alot jeez
[4/24/17, 3:50:15 PM] Brian Katz: Sex is listed as third important under physical traits
[4/24/17, 3:50:55 PM] Brian Katz: I'm trying to ask women on twitter but apparently my followers are all dudes lol
[4/24/17, 3:51:15 PM] Miller: tbh if you do not bust your gun you deserved to get cheated on as well
[4/24/17, 3:51:33 PM] Miller: what woman is going to be faithful to a guy who isnt busting his gun?
[4/24/17, 3:51:41 PM] Miller: its called demonstrating value people
[4/24/17, 3:52:04 PM] Launchpad: why is this concept so offensive?
[4/24/17, 3:52:12 PM] Launchpad: women like sex just as much as men do
[4/24/17, 3:52:20 PM] Miller: why do i suddenly sound like a moron when i make similar statements?
[4/24/17, 3:53:16 PM] Steve: No one is offended
[4/24/17, 3:53:21 PM] Steve: Literally no one
[4/24/17, 3:53:39 PM] Launchpad: but you guys are so defensive
[4/24/17, 3:53:54 PM] Launchpad: yes obviously there are many reasons why women cheat
[4/24/17, 3:54:07 PM] Miller: #1 not busting your gun
[4/24/17, 3:54:11 PM] Miller: #2 not fucking em till they cum
[4/24/17, 3:54:12 PM] Launchpad: but if you keep her happy in bed you get more leeway everywhere else
[4/24/17, 3:54:21 PM] Miller: #3 not stop dropping rolling or even opening up shop
[4/24/17, 3:54:44 PM] Steve: I've been cheated on and none of them cheated because the sex wasn't good. In case your next question is "how do I know?"
[4/24/17, 3:54:48 PM] Steve: I asked them
[4/24/17, 3:55:41 PM] Steve: But I was clearly lacking in other areas
[4/24/17, 3:56:00 PM] Miller: not 1 gun was busted
[4/24/17, 3:56:09 PM] Steve: But to my point, one last time. They could have just broken up with me.
[4/24/17, 3:56:22 PM] Steve: Cheating is never the solution and this is coming from a guy who has cheated
[4/24/17, 3:56:28 PM] Steve: Man up and break up
[4/24/17, 3:56:31 PM] Steve: Period
[4/24/17, 3:56:38 PM] Steve: No matter how hard it is
[4/24/17, 3:56:42 PM] Steve: Life is hard
[4/24/17, 3:57:08 PM] Brian Katz: Were going north 
South 
East 
West
[4/24/17, 3:57:15 PM] Steve: Yea
[4/24/17, 3:57:20 PM] Steve: It's been like this for hours
[4/24/17, 3:57:26 PM] Sean: Yeah I'm 100% not offended by your comments
[4/24/17, 3:57:55 PM] Miller: yes you are, anyone who disagrees is an offended hater snowflake
[4/24/17, 3:57:59 PM] Steve: No one is
[4/24/17, 4:38:19 PM] Launchpad: I am not saying its not wrong, I am saying they will often pick the path of least resistance.  Its easier to cheat than to have a difficult conversation - especially when that conversation is illustrating your shortcomings (shortcummings?)
[4/24/17, 4:40:09 PM] Steve: Again, it being easier is not a thug that should be used as an excuse. If we all had the easiest path we wouldn't be in reality.
[4/24/17, 4:40:25 PM] Steve: We'd live in a utopia where I am always fantasy champion
[4/24/17, 4:40:35 PM] Steve: (^had to throw that in)
[4/24/17, 4:44:26 PM] Launchpad: and while we're at it, we may as well start expecting girls to approach guys, to message first on Tinder, to lead conversations, to ask guys out....that would also be utopia -- but its not gonna happen.  And girls will often continue to cheat as its easier than the alternative
[4/24/17, 4:45:17 PM] Steve: Men cheat as much as women or more
[4/24/17, 4:45:21 PM] Steve: You realize that right?
[4/24/17, 4:45:25 PM] Launchpad: of course
[4/24/17, 4:45:29 PM] Steve: You seem to think that it's only women
[4/24/17, 4:45:39 PM] Steve: Or at least your words lead me to believe you think that
[4/24/17, 4:45:59 PM] Steve: And women should also not be afraid to ask a guy out
[4/24/17, 4:46:04 PM] Steve: Or talk to a guy on tinder
[4/24/17, 4:46:09 PM] Steve: It's actually called bumble
[4/24/17, 4:47:25 PM] Launchpad: You seem to put words in my mouth.  AT NO POINT DID I EVER INSINUATE MEN DON'T CHEWAT
[4/24/17, 4:47:52 PM] Steve: You keep only talk about how women cheat
[4/24/17, 4:48:08 PM] Steve: Sorry, find me a point where you said men cheat as well
[4/24/17, 4:48:11 PM] Steve: I'll wait
[4/24/17, 4:48:14 PM] Launchpad: cause that was the topic
[4/24/17, 4:48:27 PM] Steve: Are you really aware of the topic though?
[4/24/17, 4:48:35 PM] Steve: Because you seem to be confused
[4/24/17, 4:48:41 PM] Launchpad: nope
[4/24/17, 4:48:49 PM] Steve: Figured
[4/24/17, 4:49:20 PM] Launchpad: I also didn't say the sky is blue and grass is green
[4/24/17, 4:49:30 PM] Launchpad: that doesn't mean I believe grass is purple
[4/24/17, 4:49:57 PM] Steve: Depends if you are tripping at a music festival with white pants on or not
[4/24/17, 4:56:39 PM] Launchpad: so once again I will restate my main premise cause everyone has difficulty understanding:
If you suck in bed, you will increase the likelihood that your girl cheats.  If you are great in bed, you will increase the likelihood that you become 'the Other Guy'
[4/24/17, 4:56:39 PM] Dan Watts: all i have to say is i can't wait until austin
[4/24/17, 4:56:53 PM] Scott: nice
[4/24/17, 4:56:56 PM] Scott: ill take that second part scottie
[4/24/17, 4:56:59 PM] Launchpad: YES!
[4/24/17, 4:57:06 PM] Dan Watts: @16102201963 you buy your flight yet
[4/24/17, 4:57:19 PM] Scott: no
[4/24/17, 4:57:20 PM] Scott: i have to
[4/24/17, 4:57:21 PM] Scott: i will
[4/24/17, 4:57:26 PM] Dan Watts: smh
[4/24/17, 4:57:28 PM] Scott: tomorrow or later today
[4/24/17, 4:57:31 PM] Scott: yeah man, i really should have
[4/24/17, 4:59:04 PM] Launchpad: anyone have a room yet?
[4/24/17, 4:59:48 PM] Scott: scottie it may just be u and me lokoing for a plce
[4/24/17, 4:59:49 PM] Scott: but i'm nto sure
[4/24/17, 5:01:08 PM] Launchpad: whos not going on this trip?
[4/24/17, 5:01:27 PM] Launchpad: kiyoon? katz?
[4/24/17, 5:01:30 PM] Launchpad: anyone else?
[4/24/17, 5:01:48 PM] Dan Watts: donk james
[4/24/17, 5:02:16 PM] Steve: Also not your original argument
[4/24/17, 5:02:22 PM] Steve: I posted your original argument
[4/24/17, 5:02:26 PM] Steve: You have since changed
[4/24/17, 5:02:36 PM] Steve: #flipfloppingsonofabitch
[4/24/17, 5:05:51 PM] Launchpad: no you posted one statement I made and called that my argument
[4/24/17, 5:07:52 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/24/17, 5:07:53 PM] Steve: Ok
[4/24/17, 5:08:02 PM] Steve: Even though you repeated it over and over again
[4/24/17, 5:08:06 PM] Steve: But that wasn't your argument
[4/24/17, 5:08:17 PM] Launchpad: Let me rehash my arguments:
the way to prevent your girl from cheating -- is being so fucken awesome its not even a thought in her mind

but if shes cheating, chances are shes missing something in the relationship that you're not providing

there was a really great line - I think it was from Californication -- where Marcy says to Charlie after his new gf was cheating on him "You are so the kind of guy this stuff happens to"                        

the idea being that if you are a loser who doesn't command respect, girls will cheat on you
[4/24/17, 5:08:38 PM] Steve: Which is also wrong
[4/24/17, 5:08:43 PM] Steve: Commanding respect lol
[4/24/17, 5:08:49 PM] Steve: And basing your knowledge on a tv show
[4/24/17, 5:08:56 PM] Steve: All stupid
[4/24/17, 5:09:17 PM] Launchpad: you seem to think that if you suck as a boyfriend and you're girl isn't happy with you, she owes you  a 'talk'
[4/24/17, 5:09:29 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/24/17, 5:09:36 PM] Steve: She owed you break up
[4/24/17, 5:09:40 PM] Launchpad: it would be nice if she does, but not always practical
[4/24/17, 5:09:40 PM] Steve: *owes
[4/24/17, 5:09:50 PM] Steve: If she cares, she should talk to you
[4/24/17, 5:09:57 PM] Steve: If she doesn't, she should just end it
[4/24/17, 5:10:27 PM] Steve: You seem to think that people should cheat instead of caring or being compassionate to other humans
[4/24/17, 5:10:35 PM] Steve: Which is very, sad!
[4/24/17, 5:10:37 PM] Launchpad: No I didn't say that
[4/24/17, 5:10:50 PM] Launchpad: Im just saying this is the practical reality -- its easier to cheat than to break up
[4/24/17, 5:11:00 PM] Launchpad: and many will select that option
[4/24/17, 5:11:01 PM] Steve: What you are saying is not reality
[4/24/17, 5:11:14 PM] Steve: It's based on a tv show
[4/24/17, 5:11:14 PM] Launchpad: of course it is because it happens
[4/24/17, 5:11:35 PM] Launchpad: lol now you are obsessed with one quote I made
[4/24/17, 5:11:49 PM] Steve: No I'm taking it from everything you say
[4/24/17, 5:11:54 PM] Steve: And it's just sad
[4/24/17, 5:12:06 PM] Steve: Sure, a lot of things happen in life
[4/24/17, 5:12:12 PM] Steve: Doesn't mean that those are the rules
[4/24/17, 5:12:28 PM] Steve: And no other logical explanation exists
[4/24/17, 5:13:07 PM] Steve: But you are still but hurt about that girl ghosting you
[4/24/17, 5:13:16 PM] Steve: You should really talk that out with a professional
[4/24/17, 5:13:23 PM] Steve: Don't want to take that into your new relationship
[4/24/17, 5:13:24 PM] Launchpad: lol I don't even know what girl yhou are talking about
[4/24/17, 5:13:41 PM] Launchpad: Im not concerned with being cheated on
[4/24/17, 5:13:51 PM] Steve: Never said you were
[4/24/17, 5:14:01 PM] Steve: You seem to be more concerned with being ghosted on
[4/24/17, 5:14:20 PM] Steve: Not all women will ghost you
[4/24/17, 5:14:24 PM] Launchpad: you just keep saying random shit
[4/24/17, 5:14:26 PM] Steve: Just the ones you don't sex right
[4/24/17, 5:14:40 PM] Launchpad: and not all women will break up with you instead of cheating
[4/24/17, 5:15:21 PM] Steve: Which is cowardice and childish
[4/24/17, 5:15:24 PM] Launchpad: its a very real possibility that you get ghosted if you don't sex a girl right
[4/24/17, 5:15:43 PM] Launchpad: so is ghosting isn't it? But it still happens all the time
[4/24/17, 5:15:47 PM] Steve: Maybe that was the issue with you and that girl
[4/24/17, 5:16:05 PM] Steve: Ghosting is not the same as cheating
[4/24/17, 5:16:05 PM] Launchpad: what girl?
[4/24/17, 5:16:09 PM] Steve: They are both wrong
[4/24/17, 5:16:11 PM] Launchpad: you just made up an imaginary girl
[4/24/17, 5:16:19 PM] Steve: Not at all
[4/24/17, 5:16:30 PM] Steve: It's the girl you told us about
[4/24/17, 5:16:34 PM] Launchpad: which girl ghosted me that I'm obessed with
[4/24/17, 5:16:38 PM] Steve: Who ghosted you a couple of months ago
[4/24/17, 5:16:42 PM] Launchpad: when?
[4/24/17, 5:16:44 PM] Steve: And you keep bringing her up all mad
[4/24/17, 5:16:50 PM] Steve: About 2-3 months ago
[4/24/17, 5:16:58 PM] Steve: You brought her up twice just today
[4/24/17, 5:17:09 PM] Launchpad: quote it or it didn't happen
[4/24/17, 5:17:16 PM] Launchpad: quote it twice
[4/24/17, 5:20:07 PM] Steve: That's once
[4/24/17, 5:20:11 PM] Steve: I'll get the other one now
[4/24/17, 5:21:04 PM] Dan Watts: i can't believe this is still going on
[4/24/17, 5:21:13 PM] Steve: Scottie is in denial
[4/24/17, 5:21:20 PM] Launchpad: Are you fucken serious üòÇ üòÇüòÇ
[4/24/17, 5:21:23 PM] Steve: He is still hung up on that one girl who flaked
[4/24/17, 5:21:31 PM] Steve: We are trying to work it out
[4/24/17, 5:21:39 PM] Launchpad: No Im not
[4/24/17, 5:21:42 PM] Steve: Get to the root of his problem
[4/24/17, 5:22:10 PM] Donk: Im in west palm beach and its been providing entertainment in between pool trips/mini golf
[4/24/17, 5:22:21 PM] Donk: Please keep it up
[4/24/17, 5:22:21 PM] Launchpad: I made a generalized statement -- Im not hung up on ONE girl who flaked on me months ago.  You keep making up assumptions
[4/24/17, 5:22:23 PM] Steve: I want both of those things lol
[4/24/17, 5:22:35 PM] Steve: I along with everyone else in this group
[4/24/17, 5:23:00 PM] Launchpad: "many women can't be bothered to send a text before they flake"   Yes - this is proof that I can't get over that one girl.  I'm so butthurt
[4/24/17, 5:23:17 PM] Steve: It's ok Scottie
[4/24/17, 5:23:21 PM] Steve: We are here for you
[4/24/17, 5:23:27 PM] Launchpad: I keep bringing "her" up.  Too bad "her" is not a person
[4/24/17, 5:23:36 PM] Steve: Riiiight
[4/24/17, 5:23:42 PM] Miller: too bad robin williams is dead b/c i think he needs a session w/the shrink from goodwill hunting
[4/24/17, 5:24:06 PM] Miller: its not your fault lp
[4/24/17, 5:24:10 PM] Launchpad: have I been flaked on? Yes, of course.  Anyone who goes on dates get flaked on at some point.  However, the tighter your game is, the less flakes you'll get. Thats a fact
[4/24/17, 5:24:12 PM] Miller: its not your fault
[4/24/17, 5:24:29 PM] Launchpad: its not my fault hes fucken retarded and putting words in my mouth
[4/24/17, 5:24:34 PM] Miller: its not your fault
[4/24/17, 5:24:35 PM] Dan Watts: LOL
[4/24/17, 5:24:55 PM] Scott: Lol
[4/24/17, 5:25:03 PM] Launchpad: maybe hes just butthurt his girl cheated on him and thats why hes single
[4/24/17, 5:26:58 PM] Steve: She did not cheat on me
[4/24/17, 5:27:06 PM] Steve: We weren't right for each other
[4/24/17, 5:27:17 PM] Steve: But I have def been cheated on
[4/24/17, 5:27:27 PM] Steve: Just not this time
[4/24/17, 5:38:06 PM] Sean: Not gonna lie I have never been flaked on
[4/24/17, 5:38:19 PM] Sean: However, most were just sex and not dates
[4/24/17, 5:38:26 PM] Sean: So that could be the reason
[4/24/17, 5:38:45 PM] Steve: And because you lay such good pipe
[4/24/17, 5:38:51 PM] Steve: How could they flake?
[4/24/17, 5:39:41 PM] Launchpad: for the most part, Im talking about first dates
[4/24/17, 5:39:57 PM] Launchpad: if you get a girls number off tinder or meet her at a bar
[4/24/17, 5:40:01 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frvg9hfJYBo
[4/24/17, 5:40:07 PM] Dan Watts: @16195657200 tuning into goodman
[4/24/17, 5:40:16 PM] Launchpad: please
[4/24/17, 5:40:19 PM] Sean: I had a rule for a long time I would go on a date without having sex first so that's another reason
[4/24/17, 5:40:36 PM] Sean: Wouldn't**
[4/24/17, 5:41:34 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQybgJCswF0
[4/24/17, 5:41:36 PM] Dan Watts: me right now
[4/24/17, 5:41:45 PM] Steve: Like the girl that flaked on you @16195657200 'v
[4/24/17, 5:41:47 PM] Steve: ?
[4/24/17, 5:42:34 PM] Launchpad: I get it...you think theres one girl because Katz said "damn hes still tight over that chick"
[4/24/17, 5:42:49 PM] Launchpad: Katz just said that, he wasn't referring to a specific person
[4/24/17, 5:45:30 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFosUj6A22c
[4/24/17, 5:45:31 PM] Dan Watts: also cheese
[4/24/17, 5:47:38 PM] Brian Katz: @16195657200 I was referring to the chick that didn't text you and you were irate about. We discussed it at length in this chat
[4/24/17, 5:48:28 PM] Launchpad: that fact that I don't even remember who it was shows how much I still care about it
[4/24/17, 5:50:04 PM] Steve: Riiiiight
[4/24/17, 5:50:33 PM] Launchpad: so now you're calling me a liar
[4/24/17, 5:51:21 PM] Steve: And katz, we all made the same assumption from his anger
[4/24/17, 5:51:22 PM] Steve: You clearly are not the only one
[4/24/17, 5:53:11 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty c'mon bro, you knew who you were talking about, it was a very particular reference you made that we all picked up on.
[4/24/17, 5:53:12 PM] Steve: Never
[4/24/17, 5:53:38 PM] Launchpad: I don't even know what we're arguing about anymore.  All this is is you disagreeing with what I say then put words in my mouth that I didn't actually say
[4/24/17, 5:54:04 PM] Launchpad: I actually don't
[4/24/17, 5:54:22 PM] Steve: Pretty sure every time you asked me to show you saying that I have
[4/24/17, 5:54:22 PM] Steve: So that would putting your own words back in your own mouth?
[4/24/17, 5:54:27 PM] Launchpad: I wasn't referring to any one particular person
[4/24/17, 5:54:31 PM] Launchpad: people flake, this is not uncommon
[4/24/17, 5:55:15 PM] Launchpad: more like ONE time you actually quoted me word for word
[4/24/17, 5:56:53 PM] Steve: Twice actually
[4/24/17, 5:57:08 PM] Steve: But who's keeping count?
[4/24/17, 5:57:09 PM] Launchpad: no cause the second time you were completely off
[4/24/17, 5:57:16 PM] Steve: Lol ok
[4/24/17, 5:58:18 PM] Launchpad: you're delusional
[4/24/17, 5:58:39 PM] Brian Katz: C'maaaaaaaaan Scotty, you were fuming over this women not showing up to a date that you casually agreed on five days prior? You then sent her a scathing text about it, and crowd sourced with us. We told you that you should calm down and that she did nothing wrong, and that you should probably call or text the day before to confirm. I know you remember this bud
[4/24/17, 5:58:44 PM] Steve: Probably am
[4/24/17, 5:59:52 PM] Launchpad: yes now I remember....that was my very first Tinder date, with a girl I haven't met.  And that was last summer maybe? Much longer than 2-3 months ago
[4/24/17, 6:01:29 PM] Launchpad: And the irony is you guys were saying she did nothing wrong....as if her sending a confirmation text was such hard work....but you think she owes you a breakup over cheating??? The same who can't be bothered to send a single text message is probably not going to stand face to face and tell you that you suck in bed
[4/24/17, 6:02:02 PM] Launchpad: but no, I don't give a shit about that girl now, I really don't
[4/24/17, 6:02:03 PM] Launchpad: there have been many since her
[4/24/17, 6:03:09 PM] Brian Katz: But we all knew who you were talking about. No shame, ain't no one judging here
[4/24/17, 6:03:12 PM] Launchpad: I get mad when you say stupid shit and put words in my mouth that I never said
[4/24/17, 6:03:41 PM] Launchpad: all of us ü§î nah I don't think so.  I certainly didn't
[4/24/17, 6:03:58 PM] Launchpad: Steve hates all Jews and thinks all Jews should die
[4/24/17, 6:04:12 PM] Brian Katz: Damn steve calm down
[4/24/17, 6:04:19 PM] Launchpad: I know this for a fact because Steve never said that Jews shouldn't die
[4/24/17, 6:04:27 PM] Steve: Me? Never.
[4/24/17, 6:04:48 PM] Brian Katz: Steve you've got some explaining to do here
[4/24/17, 6:04:55 PM] Launchpad: You never said that Jews shouldn't die so therefore you think they should
[4/24/17, 6:04:56 PM] Steve: Not really
[4/24/17, 6:05:06 PM] Steve: Sure
[4/24/17, 6:05:25 PM] Brian Katz: Steve just say that all Jews shouldn't die, unless you want that, then say nothing
[4/24/17, 6:05:59 PM] Brian Katz: Damn steve that's cold
[4/24/17, 6:06:13 PM] Steve: You're reaching now Scottie. I'd settle down and just relax.
[4/24/17, 6:06:24 PM] Brian Katz: Just say it steve
[4/24/17, 6:07:21 PM] Steve: I don't need to do anything. And certainly because you are trolling and Scott's butt hurt a girl ghosted him.
[4/24/17, 6:07:28 PM] Steve: *not
[4/24/17, 6:07:47 PM] Brian Katz: Steves an antisemite
Antesemite
Antisiemite
Steve hates Jews
[4/24/17, 6:07:47 PM] Launchpad: #SteveLogic
[4/24/17, 6:08:12 PM] Launchpad: He never said that Jews shouldn't die so by his own logic he wants all Jews dead
[4/24/17, 6:08:15 PM] Launchpad: antisemite
[4/24/17, 6:08:31 PM] Brian Katz: Thank you Scotty, fuck that word
[4/24/17, 6:08:49 PM] Launchpad: Should we take this to the 'I Hate Joos' chat?
[4/24/17, 6:09:07 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/24/17, 6:09:07 PM] Steve: I'm an antisenite according to scott
[4/24/17, 6:09:09 PM] Steve: *antisemite
[4/24/17, 6:09:11 PM] Brian Katz: Oh no! There's one of those too
[4/24/17, 6:10:05 PM] Steve: Oh scott, I wonder sometimes how women are even attracted to you when you open your mouth
[4/24/17, 6:10:11 PM] Launchpad: You hate Jews and I don't think men cheat
[4/24/17, 6:10:35 PM] Launchpad: I wonder the same about you
[4/24/17, 6:11:06 PM] Brian Katz: I can't believe steve hates Jews
[4/24/17, 6:11:49 PM] Steve: It's mind bottling
[4/24/17, 6:11:50 PM] Steve: Then I realize you mainly date old women and women with kids and I understand a little bit more.
[4/24/17, 6:12:10 PM] Steve: Lol @16318489683
[4/24/17, 6:12:20 PM] Launchpad: actually I date women of all ages

[4/24/17, 6:12:42 PM] Steve: How many kids does your current GF have?
[4/24/17, 6:12:44 PM] Brian Katz: I hear that you exclusively date old broads
[4/24/17, 6:12:46 PM] Launchpad: she was older wow

[4/24/17, 6:12:55 PM] Steve: How much older?
[4/24/17, 6:13:05 PM] Launchpad: doesn't matter
[4/24/17, 6:13:43 PM] Launchpad: also, women aged 35-40 are at the peak of their sex drive
[4/24/17, 6:13:43 PM] Brian Katz: You can call em broads because that was the term used when they were young
[4/24/17, 6:13:59 PM] Brian Katz: Did she invent the hand job?
[4/24/17, 6:14:06 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/24/17, 6:14:18 PM] Miller: no but she did invent the finger in the ass
[4/24/17, 6:14:39 PM] Brian Katz: A true trailblazer
[4/24/17, 6:15:00 PM] Donk: Sweet car bed
[4/24/17, 6:15:10 PM] Brian Katz: So is it the kid or the age that gets you going?

[4/24/17, 6:16:34 PM] Brian Katz: What is the preferred pussy hair type of an old broad?
[4/24/17, 6:16:51 PM] Donk: My roomates said they would get me rims for christmas
[4/24/17, 6:16:55 PM] Brian Katz: I would say full bush, but I'm old now so landing strip?
[4/24/17, 6:17:00 PM] Brian Katz: lol Donk

[4/24/17, 6:21:19 PM] Brian Katz: But you'd put up with a 50 year broad with kids? Just deal with the pussy hair than Scotty
[4/24/17, 6:21:45 PM] Launchpad: no I wouldn't put up with a 50 year old broad
[4/24/17, 6:22:05 PM] Brian Katz: 40?

[4/24/17, 6:24:29 PM] Miller: def gonna plead the fif
[4/24/17, 6:24:36 PM] Miller: cant self incriminate yourself
[4/24/17, 6:24:43 PM] Launchpad: I made out with a girl at a club who was probably 19-20
[4/24/17, 6:24:56 PM] Launchpad: and lied about being 21 (but she didn't have the 21 stamp)
[4/24/17, 6:25:08 PM] Miller: so youngest is 15

[4/24/17, 6:32:28 PM] Brian Katz: My little birds have told me that she was over forty when you met. So is that why you dumped her, because you don't do 50?
[4/24/17, 6:32:55 PM] Miller: your twitter followers know launchpad?
[4/24/17, 6:33:05 PM] Launchpad: Your little birds are wrong/fucken liars

[4/24/17, 6:38:54 PM] Brian Katz: Steve you terrible racist
[4/24/17, 6:38:55 PM] Steve: That never happened
[4/24/17, 6:39:02 PM] Scott: We know it didn't happen
[4/24/17, 6:39:04 PM] Scott: It was a rumor
[4/24/17, 6:39:08 PM] Scott: Or do we

[4/24/17, 6:41:47 PM] Steve: They make shitty pizza and half horrific accents
[4/24/17, 6:42:03 PM] Steve: And they pretend they are from Long Island when they are really from the borough of queens
[4/24/17, 6:42:18 PM] Brian Katz: Full of hate steve, you can march for women's rights but you got no love for the Ities or the heebs?
[4/24/17, 6:42:40 PM] Steve: I don't know what either of those terms refer to
[4/24/17, 6:43:02 PM] Brian Katz: Italians and Hebrews
[4/24/17, 6:43:11 PM] Steve: Never heard of that
[4/24/17, 6:43:26 PM] Steve: But also Hebrew is a language
[4/24/17, 6:43:49 PM] Steve: I guess you can hate the language
[4/24/17, 6:43:50 PM] Brian Katz: You see heebs is an old word that was used by people that are of a certain age. Like scottys ex lol

[4/24/17, 9:16:32 PM] Miller: http://www.salon.com/2017/04/24/bye-bye-bernie-the-self-appointed-captain-of-the-democratic-ship-needs-to-stop-chasing-the-great-white-male/
[4/24/17, 9:24:48 PM] Justin: cool story
[4/24/17, 9:25:08 PM] Justin: 75% of workers of color voted for hilary--- cool fact
[4/24/17, 9:28:08 PM] Dan Watts: I personally think Bernie supporting moderate candidates in the Midwest is smart
[4/24/17, 9:29:07 PM] Justin: yeh article is hot garbage
[4/24/17, 9:29:23 PM] Justin: if you wnat to protect a womens right to choose win elections
[4/24/17, 9:29:47 PM] Dan Watts: If dems continue to push a progressive identity based platform it's going to be a bi-costal party that's never going to win a general election unless the rules concerning the electoral college change
[4/24/17, 9:29:57 PM] Justin: and you cnat win elections by just cmapaigning on a womans right to choose
[4/24/17, 9:31:56 PM] Justin: well i mean it boils down to its the economy stupid.  You cant keep yelling at people living day to day with bills piling up about how they arent being inclusive and expect to win elecitons
[4/24/17, 9:32:19 PM] Miller: Would love to see a Bernie vs Tim ferret ufc fight
[4/24/17, 9:34:38 PM] Justin: salon article is a huge strawman. its claiming that somehow putting economics first, is abandoning issues of race and gender.  Of course the author also adds to this asinine assumption by indicating that putting identiy politics first, doesn't mean you abandon an economic message
[4/24/17, 9:36:21 PM] Miller: Someone has been watching too much Bernie porn
[4/24/17, 9:36:40 PM] Justin: article is hot garbage
[4/24/17, 9:36:45 PM] Justin: shocked you read whole thing
[4/24/17, 9:36:56 PM] Miller: Just read the headline
[4/24/17, 9:37:02 PM] Miller: Figured that was enough
[4/24/17, 9:37:04 PM] Justin: makes more sense
[4/24/17, 9:37:21 PM] Miller: A wise man told me don't need to read anything more
[4/24/17, 9:40:15 PM] Dan Watts: What's wrong with appealing to white voters?
[4/24/17, 9:40:31 PM] Justin: with an economic message...nothing
[4/24/17, 9:40:37 PM] Dan Watts: Doesn't mean your not including others
[4/24/17, 9:40:58 PM] Justin: agreed
[4/24/17, 9:43:51 PM] Justin: take a look at kansas-no support from dmeocratic party in disctrict trump carreid by 26 a gun toting prgoressive democrat lost by 6 points..... Georgie osslof got 8 million form DNC and ran on same old bullshit and received  1% less of the vote than hilary got
[4/24/17, 9:44:36 PM] Justin: its not  rocket science that you cant appeal to poor white voters unless you talk about the fact that they are poor and what you will do about it
[4/24/17, 9:45:03 PM] Justin: although I think Goergia district was more middle class/wealthy overall
[4/24/17, 9:48:53 PM] Justin: being that i never posted this to the group http://resistancereport.com/politics/harvard-poll-bernie-supporters/
[4/24/17, 9:49:52 PM] Justin: also on fake news front https://news.vice.com/story/social-media-filter-bubbles-arent-actually-a-thing-research-suggests
[4/24/17, 9:52:29 PM] Miller: Yea social media bubble not a thing, I'm sure you don't see all Bernie and occupy Democrats shit, plenty of Pamela geller and Liz wheeler right?
[4/24/17, 10:37:38 PM] Kiyoon: 690 missed messagea

[4/24/17, 10:37:53 PM] Scott: Got alot of reading to do
[4/24/17, 10:38:11 PM] Kiyoon: Nope
[4/24/17, 10:38:20 PM] Kiyoon: Scrolled down and moving on with my life
[4/25/17, 12:41:29 AM] Justin: Oh man I just caught up on all of that. Katz amazing. Miller that Ruff rider stuff had me dying. A+ worth more than a scroll down Kiyoon.
[4/25/17, 7:42:18 AM] Steve: No way Herman read anything

[4/25/17, 7:42:35 AM] Steve: Not so much for Donk
[4/25/17, 7:50:19 AM] Donk: I dont see how its better for ap than ingram. Fucks both of them really
[4/25/17, 8:02:33 AM] Brian Katz: Donk you need that 2nd pick?
[4/25/17, 8:02:51 AM] Donk: For free?
[4/25/17, 8:02:56 AM] Brian Katz: Come see me lol
[4/25/17, 8:03:40 AM] Steve: I think AP vultures for days
[4/25/17, 8:03:46 AM] Steve: Hurts Ingram more
[4/25/17, 8:04:08 AM] Steve: But no worries, you have the browns RB's m.
[4/25/17, 8:08:54 AM] Donk: That i do
[4/25/17, 9:36:34 AM] Justin: Yeh sucks because I have Ingram in my other league
[4/25/17, 10:13:31 AM] Brian Katz: AP is a saint officially?
[4/25/17, 10:16:32 AM] Justin: Yeh pretty weak
[4/25/17, 10:59:25 AM] Brian Katz: That's good for you Herm
[4/25/17, 10:59:33 AM] Brian Katz: And bad in your league
[4/25/17, 11:01:11 AM] Justin: not sure it existed but would rather him landed in a soft spot will locked in rb 2/3 production
[4/25/17, 11:01:24 AM] Justin: defintiely higher upside on the saints
[4/25/17, 11:02:39 AM] Justin: i suppose only real option for that would be oakland
[4/25/17, 11:05:10 AM] Brian Katz: The Giants
[4/25/17, 11:12:52 AM] Miller: WAS?
[4/25/17, 11:13:04 AM] Miller: PHI?
[4/25/17, 11:13:37 AM] Justin: im in agremeent, also went with raiders after looking at an article on 6 most likely landing spots
[4/25/17, 11:14:04 AM] Justin: washington got drip drip kelly though
[4/25/17, 11:14:11 AM] Justin: as does james
[4/25/17, 11:15:06 AM] Justin: overall pretty shitty landing spot..better than minnesota or texas though
[4/25/17, 11:16:49 AM] Miller: payton hates ingram, so you got that going for you
[4/25/17, 11:17:08 AM] Miller: they could also draft a spiller replacement though
[4/25/17, 11:17:23 AM] Justin: would think maybe ingram takes over that roll
[4/25/17, 11:17:33 AM] Justin: role*
[4/25/17, 11:17:46 AM] Miller: yea its possible but ingram also on his last yr of his deal i believe
[4/25/17, 11:17:58 AM] Miller: so wouldnt be surprised to see them add a RB in mid rounds
[4/25/17, 11:35:38 AM] Kiyoon: I think I just need to start posting questions while reading
1. Holy shit had no idea Sandy was over 40
[4/25/17, 11:35:55 AM] Kiyoon: 2. I think women actually peak sexually in their mid 20s, and men in their early 30s
[4/25/17, 12:10:54 PM] Brian Katz: Everything I've ever heard says the opposite
[4/25/17, 12:11:45 PM] Dan Watts: I think the sexual peak is a myth
[4/25/17, 12:13:10 PM] Dan Watts: Speaking from personal experience girls of all ages young and all just want to smash all the time when with me @16195657200
[4/25/17, 12:13:24 PM] Dan Watts: Young and old*
[4/25/17, 12:14:01 PM] Kiyoon: lolol
[4/25/17, 12:14:17 PM] Kiyoon: I wish I was there in Austin so I could see the arguments that Steve and Scotty get into
[4/25/17, 12:14:26 PM] Kiyoon: definitely at least 2 Scotty schecter blowups
[4/25/17, 12:14:38 PM] Steve: No arguments in person
[4/25/17, 12:14:45 PM] Steve: I only do it over the chat
[4/25/17, 12:15:01 PM] Steve: Scottie and I will have a great time in austin along with everyone else
[4/25/17, 12:22:06 PM] Launchpad: üíØ
[4/25/17, 12:22:36 PM] Launchpad: no arguments, only wingmanning
[4/25/17, 12:22:59 PM] Launchpad: Ill take the 32 year olds, Steve can have the 25 year olds
[4/25/17, 12:25:39 PM] Steve: I'm good with either as well
[4/25/17, 12:25:52 PM] Steve: I think 35+ is where I draw he line
[4/25/17, 1:56:12 PM] Brian Katz: Anyone in for baseball this Sunday?
[4/25/17, 1:56:33 PM] Justin: keep me updated with a acount
[4/25/17, 1:56:47 PM] Brian Katz: We got 12 as of now
[4/25/17, 2:12:41 PM] Miller: im down
[4/25/17, 2:13:20 PM] Brian Katz: Cool 9:30 at west hollow middle school
[4/25/17, 2:14:23 PM] Steve: I'll be there
[4/25/17, 2:14:47 PM] Brian Katz: Cool
[4/25/17, 2:16:30 PM] Miller: i might have to go to evans soccer nonsense at 11
[4/25/17, 2:16:45 PM] Miller: also literally 0% chance of getting anyone more than like 3 ppl there at 930
[4/25/17, 2:17:10 PM] Brian Katz: We try
[4/25/17, 2:17:15 PM] Miller: oh shit
[4/25/17, 2:17:16 PM] Miller: nm
[4/25/17, 2:17:18 PM] Miller: you said baseball
[4/25/17, 2:17:19 PM] Miller: im out
[4/25/17, 2:17:21 PM] Miller: misread
[4/25/17, 2:17:30 PM] Miller: makes a lot more sense
[4/25/17, 2:17:39 PM] Brian Katz: Okay lol
[4/25/17, 2:17:47 PM] Miller: thought it said basketball
[4/25/17, 2:18:02 PM] Dan Watts: why don't you guys play softball like regular 30 year olds?
[4/25/17, 2:18:29 PM] Steve: We aren't regular 30 year olds
[4/25/17, 2:18:44 PM] Brian Katz: Why don't you come out and play watts
[4/25/17, 2:19:37 PM] Dan Watts: no disrespects but the scouts aren't coming to west hollow middle school
[4/25/17, 2:20:04 PM] Brian Katz: I bet you stink watts
[4/25/17, 2:20:14 PM] Dan Watts: absolutely untrue
[4/25/17, 2:20:28 PM] Brian Katz: You said you were a great tennis player
[4/25/17, 2:20:36 PM] Dan Watts: never said
[4/25/17, 2:21:02 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah you did, last summer, then I saw you play. You okay
[4/25/17, 2:21:16 PM] Dan Watts: i said i could compete with my ex-girlfriend
[4/25/17, 2:21:34 PM] Brian Katz: What does that mean? Lol
[4/25/17, 2:23:49 PM] Steve: Also, the fact that you think we play sports because we think we have a chance to play for scouts is comical.
[4/25/17, 2:23:55 PM] Steve: This isn't super law
[4/25/17, 2:24:07 PM] Steve: We like playing baseball, we play baseball
[4/25/17, 2:24:42 PM] Steve: With all due respect üòé
[4/25/17, 2:24:47 PM] Brian Katz: What better way to spend a Sunday then getting out there and playing sports with some friends
[4/25/17, 2:25:28 PM] Dan Watts: i'm not driving to long island to play hardball, but if you doubt my ability we can find a batting cage at a mutually agreeable location at any time
[4/25/17, 2:27:48 PM] Dan Watts: does someone pitch 65mph or higher from a mound? if not it's basically BP and i don't understand why not play softball and throw the ball underhand and drink beer
[4/25/17, 2:28:20 PM] Justin: drink beer and play hard ball then?
[4/25/17, 2:29:08 PM] Justin: other than the ball being smaller and the field beign bigger not that much a difference
[4/25/17, 2:30:00 PM] Brian Katz: Why do you want to play pussy ass softball? It's for bitches
[4/25/17, 2:31:02 PM] Dan Watts: is it?
[4/25/17, 2:31:33 PM] Dan Watts: there has to be a reason that mens recreational softball leagues outnumber hardball leagues 50 to 1
[4/25/17, 2:31:47 PM] Dan Watts: i made that number up, but i'm sure its in that ballpark (no pun intended)
[4/25/17, 2:31:47 PM] Brian Katz: Most men must be butches
[4/25/17, 2:31:52 PM] Brian Katz: Bitches*
[4/25/17, 2:31:58 PM] Dan Watts: yes that's definitely the reason
[4/25/17, 2:32:02 PM] Justin: probably the throwing the ball 70 mph plus factor
[4/25/17, 2:32:11 PM] Dan Watts: they all must lack the requisite manliness
[4/25/17, 2:32:19 PM] Brian Katz: I can see that
[4/25/17, 2:32:36 PM] Justin: also cost alot more for some reason
[4/25/17, 2:32:51 PM] Dan Watts: if you can't pitch competently theres no reason to play hardball
[4/25/17, 2:32:55 PM] Kiyoon: how many hits do you guys get
[4/25/17, 2:33:00 PM] Dan Watts: bc then you're playing softball
[4/25/17, 2:33:11 PM] Justin: yeh it spretty much softball but with a hardball
[4/25/17, 2:33:11 PM] Dan Watts: on a baseball field, SAD
[4/25/17, 2:33:20 PM] Kiyoon: I'm with Watts here, I'd 100% play softball over hardball
[4/25/17, 2:33:23 PM] Brian Katz: Hits without errors? Lol
[4/25/17, 2:33:26 PM] Justin: and some guys try to throw hard and crank it into the 50's
[4/25/17, 2:33:41 PM] Brian Katz: Well Kiyoon and watts are a little bit Bitch I see
[4/25/17, 2:34:04 PM] Kiyoon: are you guys just lobbing a baseball over the plate
[4/25/17, 2:34:14 PM] Kiyoon: or actually trying to strike em out
[4/25/17, 2:34:20 PM] Brian Katz: Lobbing
[4/25/17, 2:34:28 PM] Kiyoon: oh ok
[4/25/17, 2:34:32 PM] Brian Katz: But people try and strike out some time
[4/25/17, 2:34:40 PM] Kiyoon: still at like 90% softball over here then
[4/25/17, 2:35:51 PM] Justin: im just trying to understand the logic
[4/25/17, 2:36:06 PM] Justin: is it form an injury perspective?
[4/25/17, 2:36:08 PM] Miller: im #teamsoftball
[4/25/17, 2:36:12 PM] Kiyoon: logic is, I can't hit a baseball
[4/25/17, 2:36:13 PM] Kiyoon: like
[4/25/17, 2:36:13 PM] Kiyoon: at all
[4/25/17, 2:36:28 PM] Kiyoon: even if you lobbed it at like 50
[4/25/17, 2:36:45 PM] Justin: weird
[4/25/17, 2:37:06 PM] Kiyoon: I've never been able to hit
[4/25/17, 2:37:22 PM] Kiyoon: I was able to hit 65 in middle school
[4/25/17, 2:37:36 PM] Kiyoon: but didnt make the team cause I missed every single pitch that was thrown at me
[4/25/17, 2:37:40 PM] Kiyoon: I didnt make contact once lol
[4/25/17, 2:38:11 PM] Justin: not really relevant jsut felt like it was needed
[4/25/17, 2:38:16 PM] Kiyoon: the only way I ever got on base in little league was HBP or walking
[4/25/17, 2:41:02 PM] Dan Watts: wait so you're admitting to playing what is esssentially softball on a hardball field, recognize  that it is far less popular among our age group, and my logic is questioned?
[4/25/17, 2:41:54 PM] Justin: yeh
[4/25/17, 2:42:07 PM] Brian Katz: The word soft is in the sport you want to play
[4/25/17, 2:42:34 PM] Miller: the word ball is in the sport you want to play
[4/25/17, 2:42:35 PM] Miller: sounds pretty gay
[4/25/17, 2:42:39 PM] Justin: becuase if we are essnetially palying softball and your asnwer is jsut paly softball and ill come down, well then what is the actual difference?
[4/25/17, 2:42:38 PM] Miller: and the word HARD
[4/25/17, 2:42:39 PM] Miller: omg
[4/25/17, 2:42:41 PM] Miller: so gay
[4/25/17, 2:43:43 PM] Dan Watts: i'm not going to play an admittedly compromised version of baseball when it makes much more sense to just play softball
[4/25/17, 2:43:54 PM] Justin: but why does it make more sense
[4/25/17, 2:43:58 PM] Dan Watts: if that makes me a bitch that's fine
[4/25/17, 2:44:03 PM] Justin: glvoes bats baseballs
[4/25/17, 2:44:04 PM] Justin: same shit
[4/25/17, 2:44:42 PM] Dan Watts: it's not the same shit which is why it's 2 different thigns
[4/25/17, 2:44:57 PM] Justin: its not like there is a higher injury risk in baseball
[4/25/17, 2:45:06 PM] Miller: @feinberg
[4/25/17, 2:45:14 PM] Justin: coudlnt remember that was baseball or sfoteball
[4/25/17, 2:45:22 PM] Miller: oh it was baseball
[4/25/17, 2:45:33 PM] Justin: i eman a softball to the nose would done same thing
[4/25/17, 2:45:34 PM] Miller: only person i ever seen get injured in softball was your brother
[4/25/17, 2:45:44 PM] Justin: and hgihger chance it hits its target
[4/25/17, 2:47:18 PM] Dan Watts: there's a reason there's not a sigle slow pitch baseball league
[4/25/17, 2:47:25 PM] Dan Watts: i don't think i have to explain the reasons why
[4/25/17, 2:48:18 PM] Justin: yeh ebcuase you cant regulate mph
[4/25/17, 2:48:26 PM] Justin: thats literally the reason
[4/25/17, 2:48:50 PM] Justin: hwo coudl you competitively  enforce a speed limit on pitching
[4/25/17, 2:49:21 PM] Dan Watts: LOL that's definitely not the reason
[4/25/17, 2:49:23 PM] Justin: its impractical- but for our purposes that doesnt matter
[4/25/17, 2:49:41 PM] Justin: thats compltely the reason
[4/25/17, 2:49:49 PM] Justin: insoftball there are regulations on hieght ball must travel
[4/25/17, 2:50:03 PM] Dan Watts: also scores would be like 48-37 and games would last 8 hours
[4/25/17, 2:50:05 PM] Justin: unless you play windmill fast pitch league where thertee are no limitations
[4/25/17, 2:50:17 PM] Justin: and softball is any differnet?
[4/25/17, 2:50:23 PM] Dan Watts: yes
[4/25/17, 2:50:28 PM] Justin: bases are shorter
[4/25/17, 2:50:33 PM] Justin: battting average would be higher
[4/25/17, 2:50:39 PM] Justin: scores would be higher
[4/25/17, 2:50:49 PM] Dan Watts: i played in like 8 softball leagues
[4/25/17, 2:50:54 PM] Dan Watts: games never go beyond 2 horus
[4/25/17, 2:50:59 PM] Justin: there are also homerun limitations in softball leagues because of that
[4/25/17, 2:51:16 PM] Dan Watts: ive never played in a league with home run limitations
[4/25/17, 2:51:18 PM] Justin: 7 innings also
[4/25/17, 2:51:27 PM] Justin: i think usually cnat rmemeber been a while
[4/25/17, 2:51:32 PM] Dan Watts: do you honestly know what you are talking about or are you just making thigns up on the fly
[4/25/17, 2:51:42 PM] Justin: bt our games dont go past two hours either and we fuck around without an umpire regulating it
[4/25/17, 2:51:47 PM] Miller: how many article headlines have you read?
[4/25/17, 2:52:12 PM] Justin: honestly im not the one who was askeed a question of why and is flustered to answer
[4/25/17, 2:52:32 PM] Justin: you siad scores are hgiher in baseball... i explained that is factualyl untrue
[4/25/17, 2:53:14 PM] Justin: a groundball to 2nd base can be a clean hit in softball with fast runner
[4/25/17, 2:53:20 PM] Justin: no chance in baseball
[4/25/17, 2:53:40 PM] Justin: only advantage in softball is extra fielder
[4/25/17, 2:53:53 PM] Justin: which is there becuase games would last forever if you didnt have ten guys in the field
[4/25/17, 2:55:11 PM] Justin: literally the only thing you have going for your argument is there arent slow pitch adult baseball leagues
[4/25/17, 2:57:50 PM] Justin: i explained why it would be impossible to regulate and define slow pitch in a competitive setting....repsond with same image....rinse repeat
[4/25/17, 2:58:38 PM] Miller: pls leave the memeing to the pros and stay in your lane
[4/25/17, 3:02:00 PM] Launchpad: lol cant believe this argument is still going on
[4/25/17, 3:02:05 PM] Launchpad: oh wait nevermind, yeah, I can
[4/25/17, 3:05:43 PM] Miller: jeb bush is buying the marlins
[4/25/17, 3:06:02 PM] Miller: may he run the team as well as he ran his presidential campaign
[4/25/17, 3:08:13 PM] Brian Katz: Would it bother you if he made them into a power house
[4/25/17, 3:08:33 PM] Miller: i mean i hate them so yea it would not be ideal
[4/25/17, 3:08:55 PM] Miller: and the fact all you guys would be sucking jeters dick over it would be a nice bonus
[4/25/17, 3:09:54 PM] Scott: what if it was solely b/c of jeb bush and not jeter that they were a powerhouse
[4/25/17, 3:09:54 PM] Scott: ?
[4/25/17, 3:10:23 PM] Miller: as if that would matter
[4/25/17, 3:10:27 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/25/17, 3:10:36 PM] Miller: anything good that ever happens from now on to the marlins will 100% be attributed to jeter
[4/25/17, 3:10:38 PM] Miller: you know this
[4/25/17, 3:10:44 PM] Steve: I love how when we appreciate and respect our legends we are "sucking their dicks"
[4/25/17, 3:11:02 PM] Miller: you spelled re2pect wrong tbh
[4/25/17, 3:11:10 PM] Justin: that family knows cocaine and baseball
[4/25/17, 3:11:17 PM] Justin: great combination for the mets in the 80's
[4/25/17, 3:11:23 PM] Miller: ha
[4/25/17, 3:11:29 PM] Steve: Yet when you and your fellow met fans were talking about wright and Reyes when they were younger as the next great thing, you are just being an acid fan
[4/25/17, 3:11:40 PM] Steve: Or when you tell us a story of Cespedes home run
[4/25/17, 3:11:41 PM] Miller: not a huge fan of acid rap
[4/25/17, 3:11:49 PM] Steve: "He hits it so far!!"
[4/25/17, 3:11:52 PM] Steve: Oooouuuuui
[4/25/17, 3:12:01 PM] Steve: *avid
[4/25/17, 3:12:10 PM] Brian Katz: The Mets are lame
[4/25/17, 3:12:17 PM] Miller: ah yes remember when i gathered everyone around the camp fire to tell the story of the cespedes HR
[4/25/17, 3:12:20 PM] Brian Katz: Yankees for life
[4/25/17, 3:12:25 PM] Miller: i think we all remember that night
[4/25/17, 3:12:29 PM] Miller: it was truly unforgettable
[4/25/17, 3:12:29 PM] Steve: You do
[4/25/17, 3:12:36 PM] Steve: In the group chats
[4/25/17, 3:12:46 PM] Steve: "Guys, he just hit a moon shot"
[4/25/17, 3:13:03 PM] Steve: Sorry Miller, couldn't hear that clearly with his dick shoved down your throat.
[4/25/17, 3:13:14 PM] Miller: sorry did i interrupt some important discussions about the nuances of softball vs hardball or when it is okay for women to cheat?
[4/25/17, 3:15:30 PM] Steve: Or how about the "happy Harvey day" posts
[4/25/17, 3:15:42 PM] Steve: For a guy who is literally a .500 pitcher
[4/25/17, 3:15:43 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/25/17, 3:15:57 PM] Miller: b/c wins and losses are the way we judge pitchers
[4/25/17, 3:15:58 PM] Miller: what year is it?
[4/25/17, 3:16:01 PM] Steve: He let Harvey, trying being good and healthy for an entire season
[4/25/17, 3:16:08 PM] Steve: Then you can have your own day
[4/25/17, 3:16:18 PM] Miller: career 2.9 ERA
[4/25/17, 3:16:20 PM] Miller: zomg he sucks
[4/25/17, 3:16:26 PM] Justin: always way cy young gets judged
[4/25/17, 3:16:26 PM] Steve: Never said he sucks
[4/25/17, 3:16:33 PM] Steve: Just needs to do more to have his own day
[4/25/17, 3:16:35 PM] Miller: is it herman?
[4/25/17, 3:16:50 PM] Miller: might have been the last time you watched baseball
[4/25/17, 3:16:55 PM] Justin: with all relative factors yeh
[4/25/17, 3:17:15 PM] Miller: in 2010 king felix won the cy young 13-12
[4/25/17, 3:17:18 PM] Justin: clearlly weighed significantly
[4/25/17, 3:17:23 PM] Steve: Since the day he basically was a thing "happy Harvey day" lol
[4/25/17, 3:17:27 PM] Miller: go subscribe to the YES network and then come back to me
[4/25/17, 3:17:30 PM] Justin: and there are outliers of course
[4/25/17, 3:18:02 PM] Miller: please tell me the last time the best pitcher did not win the CYA and it was given to the guy who didnt deserve it but had more wins
[4/25/17, 3:18:07 PM] Steve: Met fans: our players don't have to do anything and we give them a "day"
[4/25/17, 3:18:25 PM] Scott: picked up amed rosario #speculation
[4/25/17, 3:18:36 PM] Steve: Mets fans talking about Yankees fans: you celebrate a first ballot hall of famer with 5 rings? Sucking his dick!
[4/25/17, 3:18:48 PM] Steve: "Stop sucking his dick!"
[4/25/17, 3:18:50 PM] Justin: bad speculation this isnt cricket
[4/25/17, 3:18:50 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/25/17, 3:18:50 PM] Miller: get mad about something that a morning radio show started, that seems rational and totally not ridiculous
[4/25/17, 3:19:02 PM] Steve: Fucking joke of a fan base
[4/25/17, 3:19:10 PM] Steve: You were the one saying it
[4/25/17, 3:19:16 PM] Steve: Every time Harvey pitched
[4/25/17, 3:19:21 PM] Steve: In the group chats
[4/25/17, 3:19:28 PM] Miller: yankee fans were trying to get herpes to be more like jeter
[4/25/17, 3:19:30 PM] Steve: And I'm not mad
[4/25/17, 3:19:43 PM] Steve: It's just hilarious how the double standard works
[4/25/17, 3:20:11 PM] Steve: I'm sure two years ago you would have taken it in the ass from Harvey
[4/25/17, 3:20:25 PM] Steve: And today it would just be syndergaard
[4/25/17, 3:20:31 PM] Steve: And def Cespedes
[4/25/17, 3:20:31 PM] Miller: so far your entire basis for being mad is things ive said in the group chat
[4/25/17, 3:20:53 PM] Steve: I'm not mad
[4/25/17, 3:21:05 PM] Steve: I'm just stating the hypocrisies
[4/25/17, 3:21:18 PM] Steve: For mets games it's ok to love your players

[4/25/17, 3:25:19 PM] Justin: another obvious point ..... desuirability>>>>>>>>>>awesome when comes to cheating... hence why noone in hollywood can maintain a marriage in either gender
[4/25/17, 3:26:27 PM] Steve: No one makes me bleed my own blood
[4/25/17, 3:48:46 PM] Steve: Side note, we are hitting up caliente cab one of these nights for dinner

[4/25/17, 10:04:20 PM] Steve: Think what you want
[4/25/17, 10:04:24 PM] Kiyoon: But I think there a lot who drag the avg down
[4/25/17, 10:04:25 PM] Steve: None of you have stats
[4/25/17, 10:04:29 PM] Steve: Just opinions
[4/25/17, 10:04:33 PM] Kiyoon: Yeah I think that's all subjective
[4/25/17, 10:04:38 PM] Steve: Many are on an elite scale
[4/25/17, 10:04:41 PM] Kiyoon: Wait till you get to Austin to judge

[4/26/17, 9:55:28 AM] Steve: Pretty much
[4/26/17, 9:55:47 AM] Miller: best was all the cardinals fans were screaming at the umpire
[4/26/17, 9:55:53 AM] Miller: like it was his fault
[4/26/17, 9:56:02 AM] Steve: I also don't know why Molina didn't just go up
[4/26/17, 9:56:10 AM] Steve: He would have flipped him and tagged him
[4/26/17, 9:56:14 AM] Miller: i think he was bracing for a collision
[4/26/17, 9:56:15 AM] Miller: get low
[4/26/17, 9:56:20 AM] Steve: And he would have looked stupid and been out
[4/26/17, 9:56:27 AM] Miller: you never expect the flip
[4/26/17, 9:56:40 AM] Steve: No, but he still could have crushed him
[4/26/17, 9:58:53 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah I shared it Facebook this morning, that shit was epic
[4/26/17, 10:12:01 AM] Kiyoon: you fux with Marshmello Katz??
[4/26/17, 10:13:03 AM] Miller: do you fuck with the war?
[4/26/17, 10:19:22 AM] Brian Katz: Hell yeah yeah, marshmello is dope.

[4/26/17, 10:26:54 AM] Justin: got ya
[4/26/17, 10:27:09 AM] Miller: the catcher cant block the plate or the runner can be ruled safe
[4/26/17, 10:27:18 AM] Miller: not sure on the technicalities of what is considered blocking/not
[4/26/17, 10:27:31 AM] Miller: i think its when you dont have the ball yet

[4/26/17, 10:34:40 AM] Miller: why are there so many ugly DJs though?
[4/26/17, 10:35:03 AM] Launchpad: is that what wearing a mask means?

[4/26/17, 10:37:44 AM] Justin: üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜIf you are still questioning white privilege
[4/26/17, 10:38:12 AM] Launchpad: oh Im sure is there no such thing as a non white raver?
[4/26/17, 10:38:35 AM] Miller: just saying if your music is good enough to speak for itself why do you need to try to draw attention to yourself by wearing a stupid costume?
[4/26/17, 10:39:01 AM] Launchpad: thats such a retarded statement
[4/26/17, 10:39:25 AM] Steve: How many do you need?
[4/26/17, 10:39:29 AM] Steve: I can keep going
[4/26/17, 10:39:32 AM] Miller: never seen timbaland or swizz beats out there wearing a gorilla costume or big bird suit
[4/26/17, 10:39:51 AM] Launchpad: I meant to direct that at @15166335046 but in actuality hermans statement is much more retarded
[4/26/17, 10:40:14 AM] Miller: so does wearing the costumes help the music?
[4/26/17, 10:40:15 AM] Steve: Can you refrain from using the word retarded
[4/26/17, 10:40:17 AM] Steve: ?
[4/26/17, 10:40:28 AM] Launchpad: how many times are you going to keep posting the same guy (deadmau5)
[4/26/17, 10:40:30 AM] Steve: Stupid, idiotic, moronic

[4/26/17, 10:40:46 AM] Justin: anti white
[4/26/17, 10:40:53 AM] Steve: I only posted deadmau5 twice

[4/26/17, 10:43:10 AM] Kiyoon: who normally doesnt wear a mask, the guy faux mask is from a music video
[4/26/17, 10:43:18 AM] Kiyoon: suck itttt
[4/26/17, 10:43:19 AM] Justin: i cant hate on guy faux masks
[4/26/17, 10:43:41 AM] Brian Katz: Wait I can't say retarded now?
[4/26/17, 10:44:03 AM] Steve: I'd prefer you not, but you usually don't give a duck what I say
[4/26/17, 10:44:05 AM] Launchpad: you calling raves white privilege is still pretty dumb though
[4/26/17, 10:44:08 AM] Steve: So, there ya go
[4/26/17, 10:44:27 AM] Steve: But you can say what you'd like
[4/26/17, 10:44:40 AM] Justin: are theyre white people dressing up like a bunch of criminals with no police presence around..... white privledge
[4/26/17, 10:44:53 AM] Justin: there* for kiyoon
[4/26/17, 10:45:01 AM] Launchpad: and theres non white people too dumbass
[4/26/17, 10:45:10 AM] Justin: cant see em
[4/26/17, 10:45:31 AM] Brian Katz: I thought we had free speech in America? People have got to stop getting so insulted by words and just worry about their money
[4/26/17, 10:45:36 AM] Launchpad: why don't you actually fucken go to one instead of looking at 3 pictures someone posted
[4/26/17, 10:45:40 AM] Justin: but you therefoor cede they look like criminals---win
[4/26/17, 10:45:51 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 10:45:53 AM] Steve: Ok katz
[4/26/17, 10:45:55 AM] Justin: agreed katz
[4/26/17, 10:45:56 AM] Steve: That's the point
[4/26/17, 10:46:07 AM] Brian Katz: Is that the point?
[4/26/17, 10:46:08 AM] Justin: i think words arent what is harming society
[4/26/17, 10:46:10 AM] Launchpad: no i didn't cede that I just ignored that statement
[4/26/17, 10:46:34 AM] Justin: your white privilege allows you to ignore that
[4/26/17, 10:46:45 AM] Launchpad: your ignorance is laughable
[4/26/17, 10:46:47 AM] Steve: Well you two don't have children or relatives with mental disorder or disabilities
[4/26/17, 10:46:56 AM] Steve: So that's your opinion on it
[4/26/17, 10:46:58 AM] Brian Katz: I am offended by the word insulted. I'd like you to stop using it steve, I'd rather you say butt hurt
[4/26/17, 10:47:18 AM] Steve: I rarely use the word insulted
[4/26/17, 10:47:24 AM] Steve: But I will Donny best katz
[4/26/17, 10:48:00 AM] Launchpad: Justin Herman's got no PLUR
[4/26/17, 10:48:07 AM] Justin: i think its tough.  You cant expect people to change their language when their dialogue was created when these words were not considered discriminatory
[4/26/17, 10:48:14 AM] Brian Katz: I rarely use the word retarded. I only use it when it's necessary, like being insulted by a word is retarded
[4/26/17, 10:48:15 AM] Steve: Great
[4/26/17, 10:48:27 AM] Justin: I think they will phase out because youth today sees them as discriminatory
[4/26/17, 10:48:36 AM] Steve: And they are
[4/26/17, 10:48:54 AM] Steve: Especially for those people affected by disorders or developmental issues
[4/26/17, 10:48:54 AM] Justin: so the problem will self correct essentially and yes they are discriminatory
[4/26/17, 10:49:07 AM] Steve: Like my neighbor in astoria who is severely autistic
[4/26/17, 10:49:11 AM] Brian Katz: No they're not, kids will always be kids and they are mean
[4/26/17, 10:49:15 AM] Justin: but still been engrained as just colloquial language
[4/26/17, 10:49:25 AM] Steve: Sure, but unexpected that my educated intelligent friends would be more open minded
[4/26/17, 10:49:29 AM] Launchpad: Kiyoon, are raves a white privilege thing?
[4/26/17, 10:49:38 AM] Steve: Clearly they are like "why do I have to change?"
[4/26/17, 10:49:46 AM] Steve: And that should have been expected
[4/26/17, 10:49:50 AM] Steve: Again, my fault
[4/26/17, 10:49:54 AM] Launchpad: or something that happens on every livable continent on the planet?
[4/26/17, 10:50:34 AM] Brian Katz: I treat people with respect steve. That's all that matters.
[4/26/17, 10:50:50 AM] Steve: I understand that katz
[4/26/17, 10:50:54 AM] Steve: I'm not saying you don't
[4/26/17, 10:50:55 AM] Justin: asking the non-white guy in the group to represent all minorities...white privilege
[4/26/17, 10:50:59 AM] Steve: Just a suggestion
[4/26/17, 10:51:22 AM] Launchpad: oh jesus you are a self hating white person
[4/26/17, 10:51:29 AM] Steve: Didn't realize a guy who birthing about people being butt hurt over nothing is butt hurt over nothing
[4/26/17, 10:51:34 AM] Justin: self hating jew-not white
[4/26/17, 10:51:44 AM] Launchpad: you're white
[4/26/17, 10:51:53 AM] Justin: i get benefit of white privledge still thoguh
[4/26/17, 10:52:05 AM] Steve: Who is bothered*
[4/26/17, 10:52:12 AM] Brian Katz: I am butt hurt because I'm being guilted into censorship
[4/26/17, 10:52:15 AM] Miller: lold
[4/26/17, 10:52:20 AM] Steve: No
[4/26/17, 10:52:27 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[4/26/17, 10:52:32 AM] Justin: well if you feel guilty, chances are steve is right
[4/26/17, 10:52:32 AM] Steve: Just being asked to see it in other ways
[4/26/17, 10:52:49 AM] Launchpad: that one comment might have been funny, but jesus the whole raves are white is peak ignorance
[4/26/17, 10:52:54 AM] Steve: Ways that by all of us can see or recognize sometimes
[4/26/17, 10:52:55 AM] Brian Katz: See what? Miller still thinks those masks are retarded
[4/26/17, 10:53:08 AM] Steve: He should also try not to use the word
[4/26/17, 10:53:11 AM] Steve: As well as me
[4/26/17, 10:53:11 AM] Brian Katz: Mostly Asian tbh
[4/26/17, 10:53:20 AM] Steve: I admit I use it when I shouldn't
[4/26/17, 10:53:27 AM] Brian Katz: What's the harm of that word?
[4/26/17, 10:54:06 AM] Launchpad: I do find it quite ironic that the guy who's mostly likely to cross lines and make insults personal is the guy who has to scold us not to use offensive language
[4/26/17, 10:55:35 AM] Justin: yeh i use the word "gay" way too often... but where does it end.... next round "whore" "Bitch" are gonna be labeled offensive
[4/26/17, 10:56:21 AM] Steve: I absolutely am unfiltered with you guys
[4/26/17, 10:56:35 AM] Steve: But I try my best to watch what descriptive words I use
[4/26/17, 10:56:38 AM] Steve: I fail too
[4/26/17, 10:56:58 AM] Justin: clearly there needs to be recognition of the idea that while these words may be offensive, there is still a scale and context matters
[4/26/17, 10:57:03 AM] Launchpad: didnt realize I say retarded so much
[4/26/17, 10:57:29 AM] Justin: N word>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>retard.  Societal context matters
[4/26/17, 10:57:29 AM] Miller: could be b/c youre
[4/26/17, 10:57:44 AM] Miller: memory isnt great
[4/26/17, 10:57:59 AM] Miller: as a result of repeated bottles to the head
[4/26/17, 10:58:05 AM] Justin: or white privilege
[4/26/17, 10:58:04 AM] Miller: impacting your frontal lobe
[4/26/17, 10:58:27 AM] Steve: This isn't a debate about what words are worse
[4/26/17, 10:58:38 AM] Miller: word ranking!
[4/26/17, 10:58:40 AM] Steve: It's just my opinion and I said it
[4/26/17, 10:58:58 AM] Steve: You could tell me to fuck off as per usual or agree
[4/26/17, 10:59:02 AM] Steve: Don't care
[4/26/17, 10:59:23 AM] Justin: personally i half agree, just dont think anything can really be done about it
[4/26/17, 10:59:47 AM] Justin: and therefore context matters
[4/26/17, 11:00:28 AM] Justin: self -serving view of it all.  I mean plenty of people think cursing is offensive- are they right?
[4/26/17, 11:01:24 AM] Justin: I personalyl try not to curse around little kids- as I don't wnat to push my vocabulary onto them- other than that i dont give a fuck
[4/26/17, 11:02:30 AM] Justin: when my parents say cursing is a sign of stupidity, i say thats fucken bullshit cursing is used for emphasis and to express emotion and in no way reflects on my lack of vocabulary
[4/26/17, 11:02:31 AM] Steve: I also try that
[4/26/17, 11:02:43 AM] Justin: Donald trump doesnt curse - vocabulary level is probably aorund 3rd grade level
[4/26/17, 11:02:49 AM] Steve: But I also don't want my little cousins using words like retarded
[4/26/17, 11:02:52 AM] Miller: http://elitedaily.com/wellness/curse-smarter-funnier-healthier/1672656/
[4/26/17, 11:03:08 AM] Launchpad: when you say raving is a sign of white privilege, that is actually a sign of your stupidity
[4/26/17, 11:03:26 AM] Justin: or is it a sign of my white privilege
[4/26/17, 11:03:36 AM] Launchpad: no stupidity
[4/26/17, 11:03:53 AM] Justin: fyi i have no idea how to spell privilege, keep having to change it- white privilege
[4/26/17, 11:04:22 AM] Brian Katz: @16316620763 your parents are hypocrites, they curse a lot and they are the loudest people I know. I've also heard you curse around kids
[4/26/17, 11:04:44 AM] Steve: I was out in my place by a father at hibachi
[4/26/17, 11:04:50 AM] Justin: wow so ive never been "cockblocked" on a gif search on wahts app- jsut typed in " white power"----nothing pops up
[4/26/17, 11:04:52 AM] Steve: Have toned it down considerably since
[4/26/17, 11:05:13 AM] Justin: I try not to curse around kids- when i do it i realize i did it
[4/26/17, 11:05:25 AM] Brian Katz: In public places cursing makes you look low class.
[4/26/17, 11:05:27 AM] Justin: and usually curse again with a shit  or fuck
[4/26/17, 11:05:34 AM] Justin: well thats just stupid
[4/26/17, 11:05:55 AM] Kiyoon: raves are mostly white/asian
[4/26/17, 11:06:00 AM] Justin: if youre gonna argue about the wrod retard and have that oopinion there is a complete inconsistency there
[4/26/17, 11:06:00 AM] Brian Katz: Asian
[4/26/17, 11:06:04 AM] Brian Katz: Mad Asians
[4/26/17, 11:06:06 AM] Kiyoon: some black and hispanic in there
[4/26/17, 11:06:15 AM] Kiyoon: but i think its cause of the type of music
[4/26/17, 11:06:23 AM] Brian Katz: No, retard is not a curse word
[4/26/17, 11:06:28 AM] Brian Katz: It's a condition
[4/26/17, 11:06:30 AM] Justin: thats societal pressure telling you in both cases what is right, you are chooisng to go with the one your mother engrained on you
[4/26/17, 11:06:30 AM] Kiyoon: I mean hip hop R&B concerts are mostly black
[4/26/17, 11:06:40 AM] Miller: wrong
[4/26/17, 11:06:53 AM] Brian Katz: Fuck 
Shit 
Cock
[4/26/17, 11:06:56 AM] Kiyoon: well not mostly, I used the wrong word there
[4/26/17, 11:06:58 AM] Brian Katz: Those are curses
[4/26/17, 11:06:59 AM] Launchpad: plenty of hispanics at raves
[4/26/17, 11:07:00 AM] Kiyoon: more*
[4/26/17, 11:07:06 AM] Kiyoon: than a rave
[4/26/17, 11:07:20 AM] Miller: RR was the 2nd concert i have ever been to that was definitely overwhelmingly black crowd
[4/26/17, 11:07:27 AM] Brian Katz: I haven't seen that many Hispanics
[4/26/17, 11:07:49 AM] Steve: Herman, don't know if you were referring to me
[4/26/17, 11:07:49 AM] Launchpad: come to SoCal
[4/26/17, 11:07:54 AM] Miller: most rap shows pretty diverse and ive been to quite a few where like teenage white kids are the majority (mostly kanye)
[4/26/17, 11:07:56 AM] Steve: Very confusing now
[4/26/17, 11:08:15 AM] Launchpad: the idea of PLUR is baked into the community of raving
[4/26/17, 11:08:48 AM] Justin: was referring to katz opinion on cursing in public veruss using the word retard
[4/26/17, 11:09:08 AM] Steve: Gotcha
[4/26/17, 11:09:12 AM] Steve: Nevermind then
[4/26/17, 11:09:26 AM] Miller: Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
[4/26/17, 11:09:36 AM] Justin: both are societal pressures pushing you to censor your language, relaly no difference to believe in one other than your upbringing enforcing one
[4/26/17, 11:09:37 AM] Brian Katz: Well fuck him and fuck you too
[4/26/17, 11:09:48 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 11:09:53 AM] Brian Katz: Censor only in certain areas
[4/26/17, 11:09:59 AM] Kiyoon: think I give a damn about a grammy??
[4/26/17, 11:10:07 AM] Brian Katz: At a family restaurant yes, at a bar no
[4/26/17, 11:10:12 AM] Miller: nobody picked up on the cleanin out my closet lyrics yest, decided to take another shot
[4/26/17, 11:10:13 AM] Dan Watts: At the RR concert @15166335046 and I were the only whites. We repped hard
[4/26/17, 11:10:29 AM] Brian Katz: Daft
[4/26/17, 11:10:30 AM] Launchpad: that was in one of the pics
[4/26/17, 11:10:45 AM] Kiyoon: yeah top left donk
[4/26/17, 11:10:46 AM] Kiyoon: cmon now
[4/26/17, 11:10:47 AM] Donk: Ah, must have missed it

[4/26/17, 11:11:45 AM] Dan Watts: Molly Percocet
[4/26/17, 11:17:33 AM] Launchpad: You're right
[4/26/17, 11:17:53 AM] Launchpad: That girl stole that tongue more move from the lesbians
[4/26/17, 11:18:16 AM] Justin: you just cant see it
[4/26/17, 11:18:59 AM] Launchpad: Also some of those girls look asian...
[4/26/17, 11:19:52 AM] Launchpad: Does Asians wearing native American headdresses upset you?
[4/26/17, 11:22:33 AM] Miller: http://m.mlb.com/yankees/tickets/info/pinstripe-pass?partnerId=DFA-1490770-80243819-151132135
[4/26/17, 11:22:38 AM] Miller: not a bad deal
[4/26/17, 11:23:20 AM] Scott: Great desl
[4/26/17, 11:23:24 AM] Scott: Especially for Yankee stadium
[4/26/17, 11:25:51 AM] Dan Watts: Cultural appropriation is not a thing
[4/26/17, 11:26:13 AM] Launchpad: üëçüèæ
[4/26/17, 11:28:02 AM] Launchpad: I would love to hear about all the white privlige you experienced at BPM
[4/26/17, 11:29:11 AM] Brian Katz: What about the million sports teams with Indian logos and their fans of all different cultures?
[4/26/17, 11:29:20 AM] Dan Watts: Remember when we were at nocturnal and those black guys were jumping around yelling "black lives" "black lives" during odezsa set?
[4/26/17, 11:29:34 AM] Dan Watts: It was pretty hilarious, they weren't being serious
[4/26/17, 11:29:58 AM] Dan Watts: You know most native Americans support the name "redskins"
[4/26/17, 11:30:31 AM] Dan Watts: This concept of cultural appropriation is a made up thing by social justice warriors
[4/26/17, 11:31:25 AM] Dan Watts: There's a wholly owned black pizzeria near my friends apt in Williamsburg. Should it be shut down bc it's Italian food?
[4/26/17, 11:32:32 AM] Launchpad: the very idea of you can't do this because my culture does this is racist
[4/26/17, 11:33:00 AM] Launchpad: I don't really remember that but I do remember all the Harambe sightings
[4/26/17, 12:26:41 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/politics/caitlyn-jenner-run-for-office/?iid=ob_lockedrail_bottomlist
[4/26/17, 12:27:10 PM] Dan Watts: Jenner/West 2020
[4/26/17, 12:27:33 PM] Miller: take all the worst parts of trump and hillary and combine them
[4/26/17, 12:27:34 PM] Miller: brilliant
[4/26/17, 12:27:59 PM] Steve: So I completely disagree with watts
[4/26/17, 12:28:03 PM] Steve: Actually couldn't disagree more
[4/26/17, 12:28:19 PM] Launchpad: best part is when she gets elected, half the country will celebrate the first female president and the other half wont acknowledge üòÇ
[4/26/17, 12:28:21 PM] Miller: you dont think kanye and caitlyn are gonna run in 2020?
[4/26/17, 12:28:22 PM] Scott: damn pumpin frank ocean in my office right now
[4/26/17, 12:28:23 PM] Scott: started a sing along
[4/26/17, 12:28:26 PM] Scott: im feelin this.
[4/26/17, 12:28:30 PM] Steve: Don't care about that
[4/26/17, 12:28:34 PM] Steve: They are both useless
[4/26/17, 12:28:35 PM] Miller: who is pumpkin frank ocean?
[4/26/17, 12:28:42 PM] Scott: haha
[4/26/17, 12:28:43 PM] Scott: pumpkin
[4/26/17, 12:28:59 PM] Steve: Except Caitlyn can be a voice for the transgender community
[4/26/17, 12:29:08 PM] Scott: i am playing thinkin bout you
[4/26/17, 12:29:14 PM] Scott: another atty in the office is singing
[4/26/17, 12:29:16 PM] Kiyoon: will have to agree with Cheese her
[4/26/17, 12:29:31 PM] Kiyoon: listened to Frank Ocean cause he's performing at the festival I'm going to in May
[4/26/17, 12:29:33 PM] Kiyoon: was liking it alot
[4/26/17, 12:30:03 PM] Launchpad: you mean the 1% of the transgender community
[4/26/17, 12:30:08 PM] Kiyoon: lil yachty gonna be there too!! listened to him and he's fucking horrible
[4/26/17, 12:30:54 PM] Launchpad: Caitlyn Jenner is privileged.  Just another rich white girl who didn't earn her fame
[4/26/17, 12:32:01 PM] Dan Watts: i think the transgender community represents 1% of americans
[4/26/17, 12:32:17 PM] Dan Watts: so she is really the 1% of thr 1%
[4/26/17, 12:32:26 PM] Steve: She earned her fame
[4/26/17, 12:32:31 PM] Steve: She won Olympic gold
[4/26/17, 12:32:33 PM] Scott: lil
[4/26/17, 12:32:34 PM] Scott: yachty
[4/26/17, 12:32:35 PM] Scott: is the worst
[4/26/17, 12:32:42 PM] Launchpad: I know Im just pulling a herman
[4/26/17, 12:33:13 PM] Steve: And who cares how small her group is?
[4/26/17, 12:33:14 PM] Kiyoon: headliners that I haven't really heard of, let me hear some opinions
[4/26/17, 12:33:18 PM] Steve: So she doesn't matter
[4/26/17, 12:33:21 PM] Steve: ?
[4/26/17, 12:33:26 PM] Steve: That's a stupid stance
[4/26/17, 12:33:35 PM] Launchpad: which festival?
[4/26/17, 12:33:37 PM] Steve: They don't matter? Lol
[4/26/17, 12:34:04 PM] Kiyoon: siggurros, the head and the heart, tory lanez, sharli xcx, lukas graham, mac demarco
[4/26/17, 12:34:11 PM] Kiyoon: hangout fest down in alabama
[4/26/17, 12:34:43 PM] Scott: tory lanez sucks
[4/26/17, 12:34:54 PM] Miller: tory lanez is nice
[4/26/17, 12:34:54 PM] Steve: If it truly is 1% of the US population that's 3.3 million people
[4/26/17, 12:35:00 PM] Steve: But who cares
[4/26/17, 12:35:07 PM] Miller: yachty is the worst, garbage, not even music
[4/26/17, 12:35:09 PM] Dan Watts: who is saying they don't matteR?
[4/26/17, 12:35:10 PM] Launchpad: dillon francis
[4/26/17, 12:35:12 PM] Steve: Torrey lanez is awesome
[4/26/17, 12:35:17 PM] Dan Watts: i was pointing out a statistic
[4/26/17, 12:35:28 PM] Launchpad: yachty was at the music festival I went to for new years -- no one caredf
[4/26/17, 12:35:31 PM] Steve: Is that an actual statistic trough?
[4/26/17, 12:35:42 PM] Steve: ^that was an actual question
[4/26/17, 12:36:03 PM] Dan Watts: that is an actual statistic
[4/26/17, 12:36:08 PM] Dan Watts: you can look it up
[4/26/17, 12:36:15 PM] Steve: I'll believe you
[4/26/17, 12:36:26 PM] Scott: tory lanez suckz
[4/26/17, 12:36:28 PM] Launchpad: dj jazzy jeff?
[4/26/17, 12:36:30 PM] Steve: Also bringing that statistic implies that it's small, insignificant
[4/26/17, 12:36:34 PM] Steve: Even if you didn't mean that
[4/26/17, 12:36:41 PM] Scott: #samplesizeproblem
[4/26/17, 12:36:43 PM] Steve: If not, it's not relevant to the conversation
[4/26/17, 12:37:11 PM] Miller: is _that_ an actual statistic?
[4/26/17, 12:37:23 PM] Steve: #cheesestats
[4/26/17, 12:37:29 PM] Steve: Only ones that matter
[4/26/17, 12:38:02 PM] Dan Watts: what i'm pointing out is the caitlyn jenner's exposure is disproportionate to her commnunity
[4/26/17, 12:38:32 PM] Steve: Don't you think an issue that is that misunderstood should be on a bigger stage?
[4/26/17, 12:38:40 PM] Launchpad: She would never win
[4/26/17, 12:38:48 PM] Kiyoon: jazzy jeff is on Thursday, we wont be there early enough
[4/26/17, 12:38:51 PM] Kiyoon: yeah excited for Francis
[4/26/17, 12:38:57 PM] Kiyoon: and Weexer
[4/26/17, 12:38:59 PM] Kiyoon: Weezer*
[4/26/17, 12:39:34 PM] Kiyoon: ASAP Ferg anyone???
[4/26/17, 12:40:32 PM] Dan Watts: i don't know if caitlyn jenner is changing anyones minds on this issue
[4/26/17, 12:40:50 PM] Steve: I would imagine the more exposure, the more conversation happens and, hopefully, people understand trans people more.
[4/26/17, 12:40:56 PM] Steve: She probably isn't
[4/26/17, 12:41:05 PM] Steve: I would agree that I don't know what she has done
[4/26/17, 12:42:09 PM] Miller: i dont fuck with any of those dudes
[4/26/17, 12:42:26 PM] Steve: Like my mother in DR pointed out a gay couple at a bar and I just asked her "would you do that with a straight couple?" And she said no and realized that she was making that an issue or a thing
[4/26/17, 12:42:48 PM] Donk: Love sigur ros
[4/26/17, 12:45:15 PM] Steve: Just think the more conversations we have about everything the less of a thing they become. And maybe, just maybe, understanding comes out of it. IMO
[4/26/17, 12:45:22 PM] Steve: But anyway
[4/26/17, 12:45:26 PM] Steve: I'm done with my rant
[4/26/17, 12:45:31 PM] Steve: Going back to work
[4/26/17, 12:45:53 PM] Scott: hows ms. new york 2015 today, asks cheese?
[4/26/17, 12:46:41 PM] Steve: She's doing very well
[4/26/17, 12:46:48 PM] Steve: A little under the weather
[4/26/17, 12:46:53 PM] Steve: I may ask her to marry me
[4/26/17, 12:46:57 PM] Steve: I'm in love guys
[4/26/17, 12:47:04 PM] Scott: thats very forward
[4/26/17, 12:47:33 PM] Miller: i would not ask a girl you are not dating to marry you
[4/26/17, 12:47:47 PM] Miller: unless miley cyrus helps you out and plays wrecking ball
[4/26/17, 12:48:04 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 12:51:28 PM] Launchpad: the proper move is to ask her father, but only if you've got enough goats and chickens üêêüê•
[4/26/17, 12:56:40 PM] Scott: seems unnecessary
[4/26/17, 12:57:39 PM] Miller: @16316620763 you will like this
[4/26/17, 12:57:43 PM] Miller: http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/330592-house-gop-health-bill-changes-exempt-members-of-congress
[4/26/17, 12:58:24 PM] Miller: its almost unfathomable in how fucked up and out in the open it is
[4/26/17, 1:03:52 PM] Justin: lol, that is pretty incredible
[4/26/17, 1:09:00 PM] Justin: @13478047760 I don't believe being transgender is a platform to run for office.  Kinda like being a minority isn't a platform to run for office.  I also don't believe that the experience of catelyn Jenner as a transgender woman mimics the experience of most transgender woman, as I don't believe the experience of say Barrack Obama mimics the experience of most black males.
[4/26/17, 1:10:12 PM] Steve: Who said that? Lol
[4/26/17, 1:10:16 PM] Justin: which rewinds back to the class argument, or the Bernie argument for the newbies, that our economics has a disproportionate effect on the way we perceive and are perceived
[4/26/17, 1:10:17 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 1:10:22 PM] Steve: Keep ranting
[4/26/17, 1:10:26 PM] Steve: No one said that
[4/26/17, 1:10:48 PM] Justin: Don't you think an issue that is that misunderstood should be on a bigger stage?I would imagine the more exposure, the more conversation happens and, hopefully, people understand trans people more.
[4/26/17, 1:11:06 PM] Justin: were your words which I assume you meant running for office
[4/26/17, 1:11:05 PM] Steve: I just said she is useless other than bringing awareness and hopefully more understanding to being
[4/26/17, 1:11:08 PM] Steve: I meant her current stage
[4/26/17, 1:11:12 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/26/17, 1:11:13 PM] Justin: thats true
[4/26/17, 1:11:13 PM] Steve: I didn't
[4/26/17, 1:11:15 PM] Justin: oh ok
[4/26/17, 1:11:27 PM] Steve: I don't think she should run for office under hat
[4/26/17, 1:11:35 PM] Justin: i agree with that.  She serves a purpose as a transgender celebrity
[4/26/17, 1:11:39 PM] Steve: I think that should be a part of her everyday life
[4/26/17, 1:11:50 PM] Justin: dont think that implies she should run for office is all i was saying
[4/26/17, 1:11:52 PM] Steve: Not as a platform for a political campaign
[4/26/17, 1:11:58 PM] Justin: agreed
[4/26/17, 1:12:02 PM] Steve: Which I didn't bring up
[4/26/17, 1:12:21 PM] Justin: fair enough I skimmed after seeing LP react to his white privilege
[4/26/17, 1:12:29 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 1:12:34 PM] Brian Katz: Will she be able to feed them all?
[4/26/17, 1:12:52 PM] Steve: She could probably afford it
[4/26/17, 1:13:07 PM] Steve: I also completely forgot to check into that for us
[4/26/17, 1:13:14 PM] Steve: Thank you for the reminder
[4/26/17, 1:18:08 PM] Brian Katz: I can't do it til next month now, moving into my house
[4/26/17, 1:19:16 PM] Launchpad: I met a Mets fan from Ronconkoma the other day
[4/26/17, 1:19:41 PM] Launchpad: he was trying to understand this taco tuesday thing
[4/26/17, 1:30:25 PM] Steve: Gotcha
[4/26/17, 1:30:32 PM] Steve: I'll schedule it for sometime this summer
[4/26/17, 1:30:49 PM] Steve: I'll also look at New York cares and see if they have any programs
[4/26/17, 1:32:20 PM] Brian Katz: I don't care though
[4/26/17, 1:32:24 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/26/17, 1:32:59 PM] Launchpad: because you're always underestimating minorities and pointing out the colors of peoples skin, and Im offended with your racism
[4/26/17, 1:33:20 PM] Brian Katz: I'll help though and give them my time.
[4/26/17, 1:42:16 PM] Miller: Doubt anyone cares but white house tax reform press conference going on now
[4/26/17, 1:43:07 PM] Dan Watts: Spicey on the mic?
[4/26/17, 1:43:19 PM] Miller: just intro
[4/26/17, 1:43:28 PM] Miller: cohn and mnuchin running the show
[4/26/17, 1:43:42 PM] Miller: moving from 7 to 3 brackets on personal side
[4/26/17, 1:43:45 PM] Miller: 10 25 and 35
[4/26/17, 1:44:01 PM] Miller: and doubling standard deductions to 24k
[4/26/17, 1:44:13 PM] Miller: removing obamacare 3.8% capital gains tax, @16195657200 will like that
[4/26/17, 1:45:06 PM] Miller: closing some rich person loopholes just for you @16316620763 but sadly keeping non-herman approved charitable deductions
[4/26/17, 1:51:04 PM] Justin: forgot repeal estate tax
[4/26/17, 1:51:29 PM] Justin: and alt min tax
[4/26/17, 1:51:59 PM] Justin: truth speak-esssentially reducing trumps tax rate to near 0%
[4/26/17, 1:53:13 PM] Miller: said get rid of death tax idk if thats same thing as estate tax
[4/26/17, 1:53:28 PM] Justin: lol either well played or yes
[4/26/17, 1:53:50 PM] Miller: i think my taxes are gonna go down though?
[4/26/17, 1:53:57 PM] Miller: would be sweet
[4/26/17, 1:54:53 PM] Justin: idk, dont you get significant portion of income from bonus-  not sure how taxes on those works
[4/26/17, 1:55:03 PM] Miller: its just regular income
[4/26/17, 1:55:24 PM] Justin: oh so they take 40% out but then giv it back in refunds?
[4/26/17, 1:55:37 PM] Miller: in theory
[4/26/17, 1:56:18 PM] Justin: "Mr. Mnuchin said this week that the tax changes would spur the economy to grow by 3 percent, which he said would pay for the vast cuts in federal revenues. But even Republicans privately concede that stronger growth would not entirely offset the cost. Democrats scoffed at the notion on Wednesday."
[4/26/17, 1:56:42 PM] Justin: lol wonder where I have heard this theory before...lower taxes= higher tax revenues.....
[4/26/17, 1:56:49 PM] Miller: presumably my tax bracket should be going down to 25% though and i dont use any deductions really besides charity/mortgage
[4/26/17, 1:57:20 PM] Justin: so you have to itemize when you take mortage writeoff?
[4/26/17, 1:57:35 PM] Miller: could get a hit on the property tax side
[4/26/17, 1:58:01 PM] Miller: not great for anyone living in NYC
[4/26/17, 2:00:10 PM] Justin: seems like great strategy though.  destroy tax revenues and increase defense spending, what could go wrong
[4/26/17, 2:00:11 PM] Launchpad: üôå
[4/26/17, 2:01:42 PM] Justin: is dont need no man a double negative?
[4/26/17, 2:02:08 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/26/17, 2:03:18 PM] Brian Katz: It's just a funny way of putting it justin. I guess you're also annoyed when the men of your house left the toilet seats up lol
[4/26/17, 2:03:44 PM] Justin: i not ej
[4/26/17, 2:10:51 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/26/17, 2:11:06 PM] Brian Katz: And he totally redeems himself
[4/26/17, 2:11:38 PM] Brian Katz: Remember the toilet paper roll he wrote on lll
[4/26/17, 2:11:41 PM] Brian Katz: Lol*
[4/26/17, 2:13:45 PM] Miller: actually did the math not great for me, probably breakeven or so
[4/26/17, 2:14:04 PM] Dan Watts: damn who does this benefit
[4/26/17, 2:14:32 PM] Dan Watts: if we're getting tax cuts and i'm not getting hooked up i'm going to be pissed
[4/26/17, 2:15:07 PM] Dan Watts: currently i get taxed the fuck out of and see no immediate benefit, and now it seems that taxes will get cut and i won't get hooked up either
[4/26/17, 2:16:04 PM] Miller: probably actually really does benefit low/low mid class the most
[4/26/17, 2:16:33 PM] Miller: would in theory benefit anyone w/massive cap gains or estate or AMT tax impacts as well but small % of people
[4/26/17, 2:20:21 PM] Dan Watts: Will be interesting to see dems response
[4/26/17, 2:22:09 PM] Miller: i cant imagine it will be extremely negative
[4/26/17, 2:22:23 PM] Miller: plus if they do it for 10 years and jam it through reconcillation they dont need any dems
[4/26/17, 2:24:00 PM] Donk: Other than you know, roads, fireman, cops, etc
[4/26/17, 2:27:41 PM] Launchpad: Don't gas taxes go towards fixing the roads?
[4/26/17, 2:33:07 PM] Dan Watts: @19732079889 horrible argument
[4/26/17, 2:33:28 PM] Scott: Very sad
[4/26/17, 2:33:30 PM] Dan Watts: Whether taxes are cut or not those essential services will always exist
[4/26/17, 2:34:35 PM] Dan Watts: And the roads suck btw
[4/26/17, 2:38:55 PM] Launchpad: defense spending is out of control
[4/26/17, 2:46:44 PM] Steve: The espn layoffs are crazy
[4/26/17, 2:47:06 PM] Steve: Ed Werder, jay Crawford, Jim Bowden
[4/26/17, 2:48:10 PM] Miller: o no who is going to give me cowboys training camp updates for 2 minutes a yr
[4/26/17, 2:49:54 PM] Justin: That moment where lp and myself agree on something
[4/26/17, 2:50:33 PM] Justin: I mean traffic from jersey to NYC could been so much less had Christie not overturned the tunnel projects because of budget reasons
[4/26/17, 2:50:51 PM] Launchpad: Im actually quite the agreeable person
[4/26/17, 2:51:38 PM] Steve: That was months ago
[4/26/17, 2:51:40 PM] Justin: Lol how long you been waiting to use that
[4/26/17, 2:51:41 PM] Steve: Don't remember
[4/26/17, 2:52:03 PM] Steve: For at least a couple of month
[4/26/17, 2:52:05 PM] Launchpad: now I got one more
[4/26/17, 2:52:17 PM] Steve: We can also show you more instances of when no one agreed with you
[4/26/17, 2:52:29 PM] Steve: See Monday's conversation
[4/26/17, 2:52:54 PM] Launchpad: Monday's conversation was quite idiotic
[4/26/17, 2:53:09 PM] Steve: On your end
[4/26/17, 2:53:12 PM] Steve: We agree again
[4/26/17, 2:53:22 PM] Justin: Also @17189742074 how long till they sell rights to roads and we have to pay for all private roads?  They did it with most parking already.
[4/26/17, 2:53:45 PM] Launchpad: no, you fools weren't disagreeing with what I said - you were disagreeing with what I didn't say as if not saying it implied I felt the opposite
[4/26/17, 2:53:52 PM] Justin: It is in fact a big part of trumps infrastructure plan as well.
[4/26/17, 2:54:01 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/26/17, 2:54:09 PM] Miller: damn @16195657200 had to go back to the feinberg days to find someone agreeing w/him lol
[4/26/17, 2:54:10 PM] Steve: You clearly missed he point on Monday completely
[4/26/17, 2:54:24 PM] Steve: But we are not going to argue about it again
[4/26/17, 2:54:36 PM] Launchpad: its already happening...but then again how many public roads am I paying for to use through tolls?
[4/26/17, 2:54:41 PM] Steve: In fact, I saw sean that night and he asked me what he fuck was wrong with you.
[4/26/17, 2:54:50 PM] Steve: Which is exactly what everyone was thinking
[4/26/17, 2:54:58 PM] Justin: Idk depends on area I suppose
[4/26/17, 2:55:03 PM] Justin: In ny-not many
[4/26/17, 2:55:31 PM] Justin: At least in areas with high taxes.
[4/26/17, 2:56:26 PM] Launchpad: Facts:
1. Woman may cheat on you if you suck in bed
2. Woman may cheat on you for all sorts of other reasons

For some reason you dumbasses on chat had a hard time believing #1 was true, and you concluded that I didn't believe #2 is true
[4/26/17, 2:56:28 PM] Justin: Lower taxes equals get revenue elsewhere which means sellin off public utilities which means higher costs for consumers in the end
[4/26/17, 2:56:52 PM] Steve: Not what happened at all
[4/26/17, 2:57:01 PM] Launchpad: thats pretty much what happened
[4/26/17, 2:57:03 PM] Steve: But again, I'm not going through this again
[4/26/17, 2:57:06 PM] Steve: Not even close
[4/26/17, 2:57:21 PM] Launchpad: Ok I dont want to go through this again either, but what main point that I made do you disagree with???
[4/26/17, 2:58:02 PM] Steve: Your original argument "women cheat because you suck in bed"
[4/26/17, 2:58:17 PM] Steve: Then you slowly morphed into other things to make yourself seem better
[4/26/17, 2:58:26 PM] Launchpad: Did I say thats the only reason why they cheat?
[4/26/17, 2:58:48 PM] Steve: But basically you were saying "if you lay good pipe, she won't cheat"
[4/26/17, 2:58:49 PM] Justin: you said was that if a woman cheats on you it's because number one
[4/26/17, 2:58:53 PM] Steve: Which is also not true
[4/26/17, 2:59:00 PM] Justin: So just be more awesome
[4/26/17, 2:59:11 PM] Steve: Also the awesome comment
[4/26/17, 2:59:31 PM] Launchpad: no, again, thats saying I implied there is only one reason why women cheat and I never said that
[4/26/17, 2:59:31 PM] Miller: mostly everything you said was wrong tbh
[4/26/17, 2:59:44 PM] Miller: semantics
[4/26/17, 3:00:01 PM] Miller: you may have not exactly said that but you did say women would NOT cheat if you were awesome in bed
[4/26/17, 3:00:08 PM] Miller: so thats saying the same thing
[4/26/17, 3:00:13 PM] Steve: You def started off with that and defended it for a while
[4/26/17, 3:00:16 PM] Miller: watch if i say women wont cheat on you if you have hair
[4/26/17, 3:00:19 PM] Steve: Then slowly changed course
[4/26/17, 3:00:23 PM] Miller: am i implying women will cheat on you if you are bald?
[4/26/17, 3:00:25 PM] Steve: It still based on that
[4/26/17, 3:00:28 PM] Miller: BUT I NEBAH SAID DAT
[4/26/17, 3:00:41 PM] Miller: /thread
[4/26/17, 3:00:44 PM] Miller: goodnight
[4/26/17, 3:00:56 PM] Launchpad: And I will continue to contend that height, weight, salary, hair & dick size don't matter to most women if you are confident and know how to satisfy them
[4/26/17, 3:01:27 PM] Justin: Lol and how would thy know you can satisfy them before they weigh that entire paragraph first?
[4/26/17, 3:01:28 PM] Steve: Again, you are saying that all those things don't matter "so long as you are good in bed and are confiedent"
[4/26/17, 3:01:33 PM] Steve: You need more than that
[4/26/17, 3:01:41 PM] Justin: Is there some sort of sexual rating system women have access to?
[4/26/17, 3:01:41 PM] Steve: Another point we tried to make with you
[4/26/17, 3:01:45 PM] Steve: Which you clearly don't get
[4/26/17, 3:01:58 PM] Steve: In LP's world it's exists
[4/26/17, 3:02:04 PM] Launchpad: what else do you need? More status objects? cool car?
[4/26/17, 3:02:07 PM] Steve: And apparently he saw his ranking and he's high on it
[4/26/17, 3:02:12 PM] Steve: No
[4/26/17, 3:02:27 PM] Steve: To be a good person, good boyfriend, have a job, have goals
[4/26/17, 3:02:41 PM] Steve: Be caring, compassionate
[4/26/17, 3:02:51 PM] Steve: Not have any awful vices
[4/26/17, 3:02:59 PM] Steve: Treat her family with respect
[4/26/17, 3:03:15 PM] Steve: A lot of different factors
[4/26/17, 3:03:18 PM] Launchpad: sure, but there are plenty of guys in relationships who aren't
[4/26/17, 3:03:22 PM] Steve: Again, you over simplify everything
[4/26/17, 3:03:25 PM] Steve: And hats you
[4/26/17, 3:03:28 PM] Steve: *thats
[4/26/17, 3:03:31 PM] Steve: Not reality
[4/26/17, 3:03:33 PM] Steve: Just you
[4/26/17, 3:03:49 PM] Launchpad: I think you guys are just running in circles to disagree with me
[4/26/17, 3:03:49 PM] Steve: "If I lay good pipe and am confident I'll never get cheated on"
[4/26/17, 3:03:55 PM] Steve: ^not a true statement
[4/26/17, 3:03:59 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/26/17, 3:04:07 PM] Steve: You are Rubin in circles to defend yourself
[4/26/17, 3:04:10 PM] Steve: *running
[4/26/17, 3:04:34 PM] Launchpad: I don't know why you're putting that in quotes when it wasn't a direct quote
[4/26/17, 3:04:45 PM] Steve: Because that's what you are saying
[4/26/17, 3:04:47 PM] Steve: And have said
[4/26/17, 3:04:59 PM] Steve: Sorry, just didn't want you to be confused so I put it in quotes
[4/26/17, 3:05:29 PM] Launchpad: I clarified my comment, that if you are awesome in bed, you significantly lower your chances of being cheated on
[4/26/17, 3:05:29 PM] Steve: Differentiate what I'm saying to what you have said/are saying
[4/26/17, 3:05:40 PM] Steve: Great
[4/26/17, 3:06:00 PM] Steve: So you are admitting you were wrong at first?
[4/26/17, 3:07:14 PM] Launchpad: No I am not admitting I am wrong, I am admitting that when I make a statement that is not 100% unambiguous, it will always be interpreted in a way I don't intend
[4/26/17, 3:07:18 PM] Launchpad: ^^^^^^^^
[4/26/17, 3:07:21 PM] Launchpad: write this down
[4/26/17, 3:07:28 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 3:07:29 PM] Steve: Ok scott
[4/26/17, 3:07:34 PM] Launchpad: you guys always interpret shit wrong
[4/26/17, 3:07:36 PM] Steve: That's why everyone on this chat disagreed
[4/26/17, 3:07:47 PM] Launchpad: cause you guys assume the worst in me
[4/26/17, 3:07:55 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 3:08:34 PM] Steve: üéª
[4/26/17, 3:08:44 PM] Steve: Here ya go buddy, play on this for a while
[4/26/17, 3:08:52 PM] Launchpad: you twist every ambiguous statement against me to prove to yourself that I'm an awful person, instead of someone stating the obvious
[4/26/17, 3:09:11 PM] Launchpad: if you suck in bed, you increase the likelihood you get cheated on
[4/26/17, 3:09:12 PM] Steve: lol I don't think you are an awful person at all
[4/26/17, 3:09:14 PM] Launchpad: fact
[4/26/17, 3:09:29 PM] Steve: I think you are just wrong in this instance
[4/26/17, 3:10:05 PM] Launchpad: you think a girl will stay with a guy who sucks in bed cause he's a good person?  Some will, many wont
[4/26/17, 3:10:27 PM] Steve: Most will try in work it out
[4/26/17, 3:10:33 PM] Steve: If he is a good boyfriend
[4/26/17, 3:10:41 PM] Steve: If it, she will break up with him
[4/26/17, 3:10:45 PM] Steve: Some will cheat
[4/26/17, 3:10:53 PM] Steve: *if not
[4/26/17, 3:11:25 PM] Steve: You obviously have a preconceived notion that you must be good in bed or she probably will cheat
[4/26/17, 3:11:34 PM] Steve: I believe it's not that black and white
[4/26/17, 3:11:38 PM] Steve: With most women
[4/26/17, 3:11:41 PM] Launchpad: of course not
[4/26/17, 3:11:44 PM] Steve: Some women are just cheaters
[4/26/17, 3:11:56 PM] Steve: And they will cheat because they want to
[4/26/17, 3:12:02 PM] Steve: And then make an excuse for it later
[4/26/17, 3:12:12 PM] Launchpad: I have a preconceived notion that I must be good in bed because I enjoy satisfying my lovers
[4/26/17, 3:12:16 PM] Steve: Most will either try and work it out or break up
[4/26/17, 3:12:33 PM] Steve: Is that why Gail wanted to have sex with stripper?
[4/26/17, 3:12:58 PM] Steve: In fact, it ended when you wanted to join in.
[4/26/17, 3:13:04 PM] Steve: Exhibit A!
[4/26/17, 3:13:29 PM] Steve: Anyone got that picture?
[4/26/17, 3:13:42 PM] Launchpad: dont show it now we're all workign
[4/26/17, 3:13:50 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 3:14:20 PM] Launchpad: once again, this guy gets so mad when someone says retard or tranny, but hes always the first to cross the line and make personal insults
[4/26/17, 3:14:35 PM] Steve: That's not crossing the line
[4/26/17, 3:14:43 PM] Steve: That's stating a fact
[4/26/17, 3:14:55 PM] Dan Watts: whats wrong with saying tranny?
[4/26/17, 3:14:55 PM] Launchpad: you've been cheating on multiple times: stating a fact
[4/26/17, 3:15:06 PM] Launchpad: maybe cause you suck in bed?
[4/26/17, 3:16:35 PM] Steve: You open yourself up with your penile hubris
[4/26/17, 3:16:44 PM] Steve: It may be
[4/26/17, 3:17:23 PM] Steve: I may have been cheated on because of that but when I've had conversations about sex afterwards with my girlfriends that wasn't the issue
[4/26/17, 3:17:46 PM] Steve: My lack of emotional depth, my always wanting to go out, my not being considerate enough
[4/26/17, 3:17:51 PM] Steve: Those I've heard
[4/26/17, 3:18:23 PM] Steve: I didn't say anything wrong with calling anyone a tranny, but it's just not the most flattering word
[4/26/17, 3:18:33 PM] Steve: It was retard that I talked about today
[4/26/17, 3:19:30 PM] Miller: more likely the women you were dating at the time is the actual answer
[4/26/17, 3:19:37 PM] Steve: Maybe
[4/26/17, 3:19:39 PM] Steve: Who knows
[4/26/17, 3:19:51 PM] Steve: And maybe I wasn't doing things well enough sexually in bed
[4/26/17, 3:20:07 PM] Steve: They may have lied to me
[4/26/17, 3:20:22 PM] Steve: But one thing I know for a fact, it wasn't what drove them to cheat
[4/26/17, 3:20:24 PM] Miller: look you and launchpad are gonna have to have a threesome in austin and we will settle it
[4/26/17, 3:20:29 PM] Miller: cheese will decide who was better
[4/26/17, 3:20:52 PM] Miller: he is a super lawyer and therefore uniquely qualified
[4/26/17, 3:20:59 PM] Steve: I can't handle scotts penile hubris
[4/26/17, 3:24:08 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah it's retarded
[4/26/17, 3:24:51 PM] Steve: @16318489683 jut trolling along
[4/26/17, 3:26:38 PM] Brian Katz: @13478047760 you're right, it's below average intelligence
[4/26/17, 3:29:15 PM] Dan Watts: we have to do a bar crawl in austin
[4/26/17, 3:29:37 PM] Dan Watts: i think this is where the third party in the threesome is most likely found
[4/26/17, 3:30:22 PM] Miller: i was asuming it was cheese in my plan
[4/26/17, 3:30:28 PM] Miller: but i guess bar crawl is another idea
[4/26/17, 3:30:55 PM] Dan Watts: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[4/26/17, 3:31:16 PM] Dan Watts: i thought he was going to be judging as an observer not as a participant
[4/26/17, 3:31:21 PM] Brian Katz: Who goes first? You flips coins?
[4/26/17, 3:31:28 PM] Steve: Love how personally offended  @16318489683 gets
[4/26/17, 3:31:30 PM] Miller: seems too hard to judge that as an observer
[4/26/17, 3:31:51 PM] Steve: I'm not London bridging anyone with any of you
[4/26/17, 3:32:06 PM] Miller: just davi?
[4/26/17, 3:32:20 PM] Brian Katz: @13478047760  bro stop using the word offended, the accepted term is "butt hurt"
[4/26/17, 3:32:23 PM] Steve: He gets personally offended by something that would personally offend others
[4/26/17, 3:32:35 PM] Steve: Oh I'm purposely using offended
[4/26/17, 3:33:13 PM] Brian Katz: That's messed up bud. I figured that you'd be mature enough to use the words I deem appropriate.
[4/26/17, 3:33:29 PM] Steve: Because that's my argument lol
[4/26/17, 3:33:49 PM] Brian Katz: I know I'm mocking you
[4/26/17, 3:34:06 PM] Steve: I know
[4/26/17, 3:34:13 PM] Miller: 8 levels deep of sarcasm now
[4/26/17, 3:34:25 PM] Miller: nobody knows who if they are even being sarcastic anymore
[4/26/17, 3:34:34 PM] Brian Katz: I don't know if I'm being sarcastic enough at this point lol
[4/26/17, 3:34:57 PM] Steve: It's oozing through my ear piece
[4/26/17, 3:35:06 PM] Brian Katz: Do two sarcastics make a positive?
[4/26/17, 3:36:09 PM] Brian Katz: So Steve I don't like the use of the word oozing. Can't you just say secreting?
[4/26/17, 3:36:25 PM] Steve: Yea, probably not
[4/26/17, 3:37:39 PM] Brian Katz: Why? I find it offensive
[4/26/17, 3:38:03 PM] Steve: Unfortunately for you, I don't feed into trolls
[4/26/17, 3:40:00 PM] Brian Katz: You don't? They need to eat too. I find that offensive
[4/26/17, 3:45:06 PM] Steve: I find your condescending attitude towards what I say offensive
[4/26/17, 3:45:11 PM] Steve: But you clearly aren't changing
[4/26/17, 3:45:26 PM] Steve: So we'll agree to disagree
[4/26/17, 3:46:23 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.pubcrawlerofaustin.com/
[4/26/17, 3:46:53 PM] Brian Katz: I just don't like to be told what I can and cannot say.
[4/26/17, 3:47:14 PM] Miller: $35/pp
[4/26/17, 3:47:16 PM] Miller: launchpad is out
[4/26/17, 3:47:26 PM] Dan Watts: lol damnit
[4/26/17, 3:47:32 PM] Miller: PLUS tip?!
[4/26/17, 3:47:33 PM] Miller: oh lawd
[4/26/17, 3:48:03 PM] Steve: No one has done that, just letting you know many people think that's offensive
[4/26/17, 3:48:06 PM] Steve: And for good reason
[4/26/17, 3:48:11 PM] Miller: Inappropriate behaviors will result in early termination of your tour & $400 penalty. Examples include, but are not limited to:

Extreme Intoxication
Excessive Noise
[4/26/17, 3:48:13 PM] Steve: Not just "I'm offended"
[4/26/17, 3:48:16 PM] Miller: could be a problem
[4/26/17, 3:48:28 PM] Dan Watts: LP def going to get sick just before
[4/26/17, 3:48:42 PM] Miller: its austin! its hot!
[4/26/17, 3:48:53 PM] Miller: i have heat poisoning
[4/26/17, 3:48:57 PM] Dan Watts: you know thats some bullshit, it's a damn bar crawl how are you not going to get extremely intoxicated
[4/26/17, 3:50:55 PM] Steve: Sorry that it doesn't directly affect you or anyone who you care about
[4/26/17, 3:51:10 PM] Steve: Which in your mind means "who cares?"
[4/26/17, 3:52:16 PM] Scott: LP never gonna make it on day 2
[4/26/17, 3:52:20 PM] Scott: "food poisoning"
[4/26/17, 3:52:27 PM] Scott: that's what he'll call it
[4/26/17, 3:56:15 PM] Brian Katz: They had extensive programs for retarded kids in my schools. I've been around them a bunch. I befriended one in my high schools gym, kid literally had retarded strength. Could lift insane weight for his age. Dumb as a rock, but a nice guy. Almost beat up ton penzinski when he thought he was attacking me lol. I never called him or anyone of them retards because it's not a nice thing to do, to pick on the weak. But I'm not going to pretend the word doesn't exist and be offended if someone uses it to describe something. Again worry about your family friends and money, and less on words people use in jest.
[4/26/17, 3:56:40 PM] Brian Katz: Tom*
[4/26/17, 3:57:16 PM] Miller: was he weak or strong? make up your mind
[4/26/17, 3:57:25 PM] Brian Katz: Weak minded
[4/26/17, 3:57:31 PM] Miller: god i would love to see him vs cheese in a bench press competition
[4/26/17, 3:57:36 PM] Brian Katz: Strong as an ic
[4/26/17, 3:57:51 PM] Brian Katz: He would've literally killed cheese.
[4/26/17, 3:58:00 PM] Brian Katz: He was like 6.6
[4/26/17, 3:58:08 PM] Brian Katz: 250lbs
[4/26/17, 3:58:20 PM] Dan Watts: he wouldn't have fucked with me on the bench press tho
[4/26/17, 3:58:44 PM] Brian Katz: Sure 135 1rep lol
[4/26/17, 3:58:55 PM] Dan Watts: only had to do 1 to win
[4/26/17, 3:59:06 PM] Brian Katz: True lol
[4/26/17, 3:59:14 PM] Dan Watts: i was drunk and high and tired from playing lockdown defense and beer pong, give a brother a break
[4/26/17, 3:59:17 PM] Miller: no wasted energy
[4/26/17, 3:59:59 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese gun to your head, what's your top weight one rep?
[4/26/17, 4:03:02 PM] Launchpad: heres what I think is retarded:
1) I make a statement thats not 100% unambigous, 
2) people jump to conclusions and make their own interpretations on what they think I meant
3) I try to clarify my statement and further elaborate what I intended
4) I get accused on not saying that, being a flipflopper etc
5) Steve "quotes" me with fake quotes - adding in his own words and interpretations
6) We no longer argue over the intention of my original points, but what I actually said or didn't say
7) We have now gone full Retard
[4/26/17, 4:04:28 PM] Steve: So because you knew one kid with developmental disabilities in high school, who you befriended, you now can use a derogatory word?
[4/26/17, 4:04:43 PM] Steve: Sounds like a racist defending using the N word
[4/26/17, 4:04:49 PM] Steve: Because he knows a black guy
[4/26/17, 4:04:55 PM] Steve: Awesome
[4/26/17, 4:04:58 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty just say you're still annoyed over that chick that flaked in you lol
[4/26/17, 4:05:10 PM] Steve: It's almost easy how easily my point is proven by katz
[4/26/17, 4:05:24 PM] Steve: Crazy*
[4/26/17, 4:05:24 PM] Brian Katz: I knew a bunch of them stev
[4/26/17, 4:05:43 PM] Steve: So you knew a handful of kids with developmental disorders
[4/26/17, 4:05:51 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[4/26/17, 4:05:54 PM] Steve: Did you ever call them retards to their faces?
[4/26/17, 4:05:58 PM] Brian Katz: How many have you known?
[4/26/17, 4:06:01 PM] Steve: Or was that in appropriate?
[4/26/17, 4:06:08 PM] Steve: I've known several
[4/26/17, 4:06:16 PM] Brian Katz: No, and I said that in my story
[4/26/17, 4:06:19 PM] Steve: In fact I used to babysit a kid with severe autism
[4/26/17, 4:06:21 PM] Steve: For free
[4/26/17, 4:06:33 PM] Brian Katz: That's not a retarded kid
[4/26/17, 4:06:37 PM] Steve: And he was amazingly gifted
[4/26/17, 4:06:50 PM] Brian Katz: I'm talking palsy
[4/26/17, 4:07:01 PM] Steve: Many people refer to kids with autism as "retards"
[4/26/17, 4:07:15 PM] Steve: People like yourself who find nothing wrong with the use of the word
[4/26/17, 4:07:27 PM] Brian Katz: Okay well that's. It who I'm talking about, and it's no where near the same thing
[4/26/17, 4:07:33 PM] Miller: he was close on the 135, could probably get 120 or something up
[4/26/17, 4:07:50 PM] Steve: Who cares what kind of developmental disorder they had?
[4/26/17, 4:07:56 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 4:08:51 PM] Steve: The point is, it's an offensive word to use to describe someone who is not as intelligent as you.
[4/26/17, 4:08:58 PM] Brian Katz: Whatever bro, you try to save the world one word at a time.
[4/26/17, 4:09:04 PM] Steve: Regardless of their disorder or stupidity.
[4/26/17, 4:09:05 PM] Miller: @16195657200 once had got head from a girl in a helmet, i think he wins this competition
[4/26/17, 4:09:07 PM] Brian Katz: It isn't
[4/26/17, 4:09:10 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 4:09:15 PM] Steve: Not trying to do that
[4/26/17, 4:09:26 PM] Steve: But let's be over dramatic about what this conversation is about lol
[4/26/17, 4:09:44 PM] Brian Katz: This conversation is retarded
[4/26/17, 4:09:51 PM] Steve: Yes katz, I believe I am saving the world by talking to a friend on a group chat that includes 8 other people
[4/26/17, 4:10:05 PM] Steve: That's how i thing the world gets saved
[4/26/17, 4:10:11 PM] Steve: *think
[4/26/17, 4:10:22 PM] Brian Katz: It includes 11 people besides us
[4/26/17, 4:10:37 PM] Steve: Or maybe I just believed I could have a somewhat deep conversation with a person of reason
[4/26/17, 4:10:44 PM] Steve: Clearly, you just want to troll
[4/26/17, 4:11:15 PM] Steve: And blown it off as if I'm trying to stop you or change you
[4/26/17, 4:11:20 PM] Steve: This was just a conversation
[4/26/17, 4:11:44 PM] Steve: Clearly I know you will be whoever you want to Ben
[4/26/17, 4:11:49 PM] Steve: *be
[4/26/17, 4:12:19 PM] Brian Katz: Have you ever met anyone who ever had a problem with me?
[4/26/17, 4:12:33 PM] Miller: rich jones
[4/26/17, 4:12:40 PM] Miller: remember when you wouldnt let him in that cab?
[4/26/17, 4:12:40 PM] Brian Katz: That matters
[4/26/17, 4:12:44 PM] Miller: oh then no
[4/26/17, 4:12:50 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/26/17, 4:12:54 PM] Miller: oh man forgot about stephan
[4/26/17, 4:12:58 PM] Miller: but still not
[4/26/17, 4:12:59 PM] Brian Katz: We made up
[4/26/17, 4:13:01 PM] Miller: for the qualifier
[4/26/17, 4:13:02 PM] Miller: cmon
[4/26/17, 4:13:17 PM] Steve: So because I've met your friends and they all like you, that's all that matters?
[4/26/17, 4:13:34 PM] Steve: Guess you got the world figured out
[4/26/17, 4:13:39 PM] Steve: Sorry for bringing it up
[4/26/17, 4:13:41 PM] Miller: are you implying ALL THINGS MATTER steve?
[4/26/17, 4:14:01 PM] Steve: I'll make sure I bring up conversations about only sports, fantasy and women.
[4/26/17, 4:14:38 PM] Steve: Also, you are once again taking it offensively like I believe you are a bad person.
[4/26/17, 4:14:50 PM] Brian Katz: I'm implying that I treat people a certain way, and you are implying that I'm some sort of crude brute, because I don't want to be censored
[4/26/17, 4:14:50 PM] Steve: That's not what this is.
[4/26/17, 4:15:16 PM] Steve: You treat everyone that I've seen with the utmost respect
[4/26/17, 4:15:33 PM] Brian Katz: Do you believe that we should censor our vocabulary?
[4/26/17, 4:15:35 PM] Steve: But that doesn't justify you using retard in a derogatory term
[4/26/17, 4:15:36 PM] Steve: Sorry
[4/26/17, 4:15:38 PM] Steve: Just doesn't
[4/26/17, 4:15:53 PM] Miller: except rich jones
[4/26/17, 4:16:34 PM] Steve: I believe we should be cognizant of other people around us
[4/26/17, 4:16:39 PM] Steve: Like with cursing around kids
[4/26/17, 4:16:44 PM] Miller: unless its rich jones
[4/26/17, 4:16:46 PM] Steve: And using words like retard
[4/26/17, 4:16:58 PM] Steve: Rich Jones is the exception for all of us
[4/26/17, 4:17:01 PM] Steve: Fuck that guy
[4/26/17, 4:17:30 PM] Dan Watts: be more sympathetic to rich jones
[4/26/17, 4:17:32 PM] Brian Katz: He's the biggest cheap-o I've ever met
[4/26/17, 4:17:42 PM] Dan Watts: he doesn't have the privilege of white privilege
[4/26/17, 4:17:58 PM] Steve: And he is a straight dick
[4/26/17, 4:18:07 PM] Brian Katz: So you'd be offended if I described something retarded, that wasn't a person?
[4/26/17, 4:18:08 PM] Miller: wonder if he gets invited to cheese wedding 2.0
[4/26/17, 4:18:09 PM] Steve: Like I think he'd sell his own mother for a free whopper
[4/26/17, 4:18:32 PM] Scott: never doing a real wedding like tha tagain
[4/26/17, 4:18:34 PM] Scott: thatwa stoo much
[4/26/17, 4:18:44 PM] Steve: I would just expect better word usage
[4/26/17, 4:18:46 PM] Steve: Like stupid
[4/26/17, 4:18:49 PM] Steve: Idiotic
[4/26/17, 4:18:53 PM] Steve: Moronic
[4/26/17, 4:18:58 PM] Brian Katz: I would be all about Rich Jones if he rsvped to cheese wedding 2.0 and flaked again lol
[4/26/17, 4:19:06 PM] Miller: famous last words
[4/26/17, 4:19:32 PM] Miller: but first he goes to the brunch and steals all the food again
[4/26/17, 4:19:35 PM] Miller: then no-shows the wedding
[4/26/17, 4:19:40 PM] Brian Katz: For sure will be another cheese wedding
[4/26/17, 4:19:51 PM] Brian Katz: Lol yes
[4/26/17, 4:19:54 PM] Steve: I know I've used the word retard before and I've been mad at myself
[4/26/17, 4:20:06 PM] Brian Katz: Why?
[4/26/17, 4:20:07 PM] Steve: Also, cheese is def getting remarried
[4/26/17, 4:20:15 PM] Brian Katz: For sure
[4/26/17, 4:20:17 PM] Steve: Because it's offensive to a lot of people
[4/26/17, 4:20:32 PM] Steve: And I'm sorry if believe hats important
[4/26/17, 4:20:39 PM] Miller: üé©
[4/26/17, 4:20:42 PM] Steve: üé©
[4/26/17, 4:20:45 PM] Steve: Damn it
[4/26/17, 4:20:48 PM] Miller: i know someone else who believes hats are important
[4/26/17, 4:21:12 PM] Brian Katz: A lot of people think the earth is flat, should we just pretend their not retarded?
[4/26/17, 4:21:32 PM] Steve: They are ignorant and uninformed
[4/26/17, 4:21:37 PM] Miller: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18710759/kyrie-irving-cleveland-cavaliers-believes-earth-flat
[4/26/17, 4:21:41 PM] Steve: Excuse science
[4/26/17, 4:21:45 PM] Steve: *because
[4/26/17, 4:22:21 PM] Brian Katz: Lol what a dummy
[4/26/17, 4:23:42 PM] Miller: "I know the science, I know everything possible" - guy who thinks the earth is flat
[4/26/17, 4:25:55 PM] Launchpad: *they're
[4/26/17, 4:28:07 PM] Miller: so confused
[4/26/17, 4:28:27 PM] Steve: It's the girl I brought to the game on Sunday
[4/26/17, 4:28:31 PM] Steve: Was asking her out again
[4/26/17, 4:28:41 PM] Brian Katz: Blow me Scotty you bald pussy lol

[4/26/17, 4:28:50 PM] Steve: Samantha
[4/26/17, 4:28:58 PM] Steve: Sam for short

[4/26/17, 4:29:11 PM] Launchpad: Trollception
[4/26/17, 4:29:11 PM] Steve: Apparently
[4/26/17, 4:29:23 PM] Miller: i thought he was more of a landing strip guy? what did we decide yest?
[4/26/17, 4:29:28 PM] Steve: Writing on the wall
[4/26/17, 4:29:44 PM] Launchpad: no no no Im all about the hairless
[4/26/17, 4:29:45 PM] Miller: just using you for your sick nycfcfcfcfcfc seats
[4/26/17, 4:30:36 PM] Brian Katz: Maybe she doesn't want to go rock climbing
[4/26/17, 4:31:10 PM] Brian Katz: I bet if you said, a nice dinner she'd be all over
[4/26/17, 4:31:12 PM] Brian Katz: It
[4/26/17, 4:31:25 PM] Steve: I would have taken her afterwards lol
[4/26/17, 4:31:57 PM] Launchpad: Rules of dating:
1) if she suggests a raincheck, she wants to see you
2) if she doesn't, she's probably just being polite
[4/26/17, 4:32:36 PM] Miller: probably only woman related thing ive ever agreed w/@16195657200 on
[4/26/17, 4:32:41 PM] Miller: screenshot that your archives
[4/26/17, 4:33:48 PM] Steve: Well that's that
[4/26/17, 4:33:56 PM] Launchpad: you might be surprised to learn that I know what Im talking about
[4/26/17, 4:36:13 PM] Steve: We'd all be shocked
[4/26/17, 4:37:47 PM] Launchpad: you shouldn't be
[4/26/17, 4:57:09 PM] Miller: @13478047760 i forgot i actually am gonna be sticking around late at work tomorrow, i might be down to meet up w/you and watch the draft, lmk what your plan is
[4/26/17, 4:58:02 PM] Brian Katz: Let's go Giants
[4/26/17, 4:58:13 PM] Steve: Ok
[4/26/17, 4:58:24 PM] Steve: I have a soccer game early then I can meet up afterwards
[4/26/17, 4:58:44 PM] Miller: alright, i think woods wanted to meet up also ill see what his deal is
[4/26/17, 4:59:05 PM] Kiyoon: Woods is real?
[4/26/17, 4:59:38 PM] Steve: Rather not see that guy lol
[4/26/17, 4:59:38 PM] Miller: only wednesday but been top 2 or 3 most miserable weeks of work already so idk how much longer i can hold out w/o drinking
[4/26/17, 4:59:51 PM] Steve: Literally has wasted 3 days of my life with trades
[4/26/17, 5:00:06 PM] Miller: yea im sure hes the one wasting your time, not vice versa
[4/26/17, 5:00:12 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 5:00:24 PM] Steve: Sorry, because texts take so much time to respond
[4/26/17, 5:00:26 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 5:00:28 PM] Miller: just keep sending him offers for mccoy im sure he loves that
[4/26/17, 5:00:41 PM] Steve: He clearly joined the league for the right reasons
[4/26/17, 5:00:50 PM] Steve: Great pick
[4/26/17, 5:00:53 PM] Miller: YOU WILL ACCEPT MY MCCOY OFFER
[4/26/17, 5:00:57 PM] Miller: or i will keep sending it to you
[4/26/17, 5:01:17 PM] Steve: He could also just say he doesn't want McCoy, which he doesn't
[4/26/17, 5:01:28 PM] Miller: has he rejected the trades?
[4/26/17, 5:01:30 PM] Miller: or has he countered?
[4/26/17, 5:01:33 PM] Steve: He just keeps saying "I want to wait until close to the draft"
[4/26/17, 5:01:36 PM] Steve: He's countered
[4/26/17, 5:01:41 PM] Steve: And then rejected the counters
[4/26/17, 5:01:44 PM] Steve: Which he made
[4/26/17, 5:02:04 PM] Miller: from the trade revoking king that statement means nothing
[4/26/17, 5:02:23 PM] Steve: That's not even the same thing
[4/26/17, 5:03:23 PM] Miller: at least hes responding to trades, more than i can say about some people
[4/26/17, 5:03:28 PM] Miller: and an improvement over last yr
[4/26/17, 5:03:32 PM] Miller: moving in the right direction
[4/26/17, 5:03:36 PM] Steve: That's because I hound him with texts
[4/26/17, 5:03:41 PM] Steve: If not, he'd ignore as well
[4/26/17, 5:03:59 PM] Miller: wasnt just you he told me he rejected some donk trades as well
[4/26/17, 5:04:36 PM] Steve: Oh I'm fine with the trade rejections
[4/26/17, 5:04:43 PM] Steve: Clearly I'm fine with that
[4/26/17, 5:05:01 PM] Steve: But he's either the president of the United States or just can't text and work at the same time
[4/26/17, 5:05:11 PM] Steve: Because it takes him days on end
[4/26/17, 5:06:03 PM] Launchpad: maybe he just doesn't respect you and think you're important?
[4/26/17, 5:06:12 PM] Steve: That is probably it
[4/26/17, 5:06:19 PM] Steve: But then don't join a dynasty league
[4/26/17, 5:06:44 PM] Dan Watts: that chick has a gf?
[4/26/17, 5:06:58 PM] Steve: I think he's married?
[4/26/17, 5:07:14 PM] Miller: why does he need to make a decision w/in an hour in the middle of april?
[4/26/17, 5:07:38 PM] Steve: Who said within an hour?
[4/26/17, 5:07:45 PM] Miller: if hes not responding at all yes thats an issue
[4/26/17, 5:07:52 PM] Miller: if hes not responding fast enough for your liking then w/e
[4/26/17, 5:08:04 PM] Steve: I've given him days before and has to text him multiple times just to get anything
[4/26/17, 5:08:25 PM] Steve: He's def gotten better
[4/26/17, 5:08:36 PM] Steve: But it's a low bar
[4/26/17, 5:09:07 PM] Miller: like i said, theres other people who are in the lg who do not respond at all
[4/26/17, 5:09:24 PM] Steve: Which is also wrong
[4/26/17, 5:09:34 PM] Steve: And shouldn't happen
[4/26/17, 5:09:52 PM] Steve: Anyway
[4/26/17, 5:10:00 PM] Steve: You're right, who cares?
[4/26/17, 5:10:10 PM] Steve: I'll see you tomorrow if you are down
[4/26/17, 5:10:14 PM] Steve: Just keep me posted
[4/26/17, 5:10:31 PM] Miller: midtown work for you?
[4/26/17, 5:10:43 PM] Steve: Yea that's fine
[4/26/17, 5:11:10 PM] Brian Katz: Who doesn't respond at all?
[4/26/17, 5:11:39 PM] Miller: im not snintchin on anyone
[4/26/17, 5:11:41 PM] Miller: they know who they are
[4/26/17, 5:11:57 PM] Launchpad: why would you be surprised to know that people don't respond to spam
[4/26/17, 5:12:08 PM] Miller: that hurts
[4/26/17, 5:12:28 PM] Launchpad: SPAM = 95% of Steve's trade offers
[4/26/17, 5:12:47 PM] Brian Katz: True
[4/26/17, 5:13:03 PM] Miller: woods busy looking for the unsubscribe button
[4/26/17, 5:13:05 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 5:13:24 PM] Steve: That's it
[4/26/17, 5:13:26 PM] Dan Watts: every once in awhile someone clicks on the spam @16313981203
[4/26/17, 5:13:33 PM] Miller: hahaha
[4/26/17, 5:13:36 PM] Steve: It's my shitty trade offers that have led me to a chip
[4/26/17, 5:14:09 PM] Miller: does ms ny 2015 know about your belt yet? might help you seal the deal
[4/26/17, 5:14:37 PM] Steve: I don't share my main squeeze with anyone
[4/26/17, 5:15:06 PM] Brian Katz: You shared it with abuela
[4/26/17, 5:15:14 PM] Steve: Nope
[4/26/17, 5:15:22 PM] Brian Katz: There's pics
[4/26/17, 5:15:30 PM] Steve: She is just my Justin Bieber while I walk to the ring
[4/26/17, 5:15:36 PM] Steve: Abuela holds it down
[4/26/17, 5:15:46 PM] Brian Katz: What does that even mean?
[4/26/17, 5:17:00 PM] Brian Katz: She actually held the belt
[4/26/17, 5:18:23 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[4/26/17, 5:18:33 PM] Brian Katz: They have too many belts in boxing
[4/26/17, 5:18:45 PM] Brian Katz: Like which one matters the most?
[4/26/17, 5:20:52 PM] Steve: The one you care about most?
[4/26/17, 5:21:56 PM] Brian Katz: I mean to the world? Which is most prestigious
[4/26/17, 5:28:45 PM] Steve: Aren't they all of the world
[4/26/17, 5:28:52 PM] Steve: Like lightweight champion of he world
[4/26/17, 5:28:58 PM] Steve: Heavyweight champion of the world
[4/26/17, 5:35:42 PM] Dan Watts: i think what katz means is that each weight class has multiple belts
[4/26/17, 5:36:06 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[4/26/17, 5:36:10 PM] Dan Watts: there's like the IBC WBA
[4/26/17, 5:36:31 PM] Dan Watts: theres these various boxing organizations and they all have their own belts
[4/26/17, 5:37:02 PM] Brian Katz: It's stupid
[4/26/17, 5:37:18 PM] Dan Watts: i don't disagree
[4/26/17, 5:37:41 PM] Steve: Katz layered up
[4/26/17, 5:37:45 PM] Steve: *lawyered
[4/26/17, 5:38:01 PM] Steve: Now def can't "tell him what to say"
[4/26/17, 5:38:12 PM] Dan Watts: i think when boxing was more popular the various organizations ran the fights so you could be a champion for one organization and not another
[4/26/17, 5:38:12 PM] Steve: At least he super lawyered up
[4/26/17, 5:38:59 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah but no one knows the difference. It's not like UFC vs bellitor
[4/26/17, 5:39:24 PM] Dan Watts: right
[4/26/17, 5:39:25 PM] Brian Katz: Like when manny lost to Floyd it was for a title. But only one of his 19
[4/26/17, 5:39:58 PM] Brian Katz: They don't ever have to defend these titles, cheapens them
[4/26/17, 5:44:43 PM] Dan Watts: i want to see jon jones comier
[4/26/17, 5:45:02 PM] Dan Watts: cormier screwed me out of $50 once can't let that happen again
[4/26/17, 5:45:07 PM] Steve: Want to lose another $50?
[4/26/17, 5:45:54 PM] Dan Watts: lol you want to bet me now even before theres a date?
[4/26/17, 5:46:10 PM] Dan Watts: fine i'll take jon jones, PUT IT ON THE BOARD
[4/26/17, 5:47:13 PM] Steve: If he gets disqualified for drugs, do I win?
[4/26/17, 5:47:46 PM] Dan Watts: i was just going to add the proviso
[4/26/17, 5:47:57 PM] Dan Watts: if he's disqualified before the fight the bet is void
[4/26/17, 5:49:24 PM] Justin: dissapointing 400 messages
[4/26/17, 5:49:32 PM] Justin: kinda retarded overall
[4/26/17, 5:55:00 PM] Steve: What about after?
[4/26/17, 5:55:40 PM] Dan Watts: do they disqualify someone afterwards?
[4/26/17, 5:56:03 PM] Steve: If they failed a test? Absolutely
[4/26/17, 5:56:12 PM] Steve: Or they at least strip him of the belt
[4/26/17, 6:00:16 PM] Brian Katz: @16316620763 that retarded was like fine  artwork lol
[4/26/17, 6:01:31 PM] Justin: thank you, and I meant to say before,   ej Pmsing over the toilet paper roll was a major factor in my associating bitchness with ej.
[4/26/17, 6:06:02 PM] Justin: with that said time to get annoying because  a weeks worth of arguing isn't enough.   I do want to reemphasize that I emphatically reject the claim that if you give bad dick, you "greatly" increase the chances of being cheated on. Most relationships don't begin until well after multiple rounds of sex, so why would a girl get into a relationship when she isn't satisfied and knows she will end up cheating bc of it?    Presumably she has made that mistake in the past(getting into an unsatisfying sexual relationship and cheating) and it didn't end well as being caught cheating is emotionally crippling to anyone whom isn't a sociopath.  It's just a very one dimensional approach to human behavior, to beat a deadhorse, its retarded
[4/26/17, 6:06:46 PM] Launchpad: üëèüëèüëè
[4/26/17, 6:07:19 PM] Launchpad: I am applauding this fact: "Most relationships don't begin until well after multiple rounds of sex, so why would a girl get into a relationship when she isn't satisfied and knows she will end up cheating bc of it?"
[4/26/17, 6:08:08 PM] Launchpad: we never specified what kinds of relationships we were talking about -- short term vs. long term vs. fwb
[4/26/17, 6:08:29 PM] Justin: well to cheat it clearly has to be an exclusive relationship
[4/26/17, 6:08:49 PM] Justin: and exclusive predominantly means long term
[4/26/17, 6:09:01 PM] Launchpad: So I should add to my claims -- if you give bad dick, you will inhibit your ability to get a girlfriend
[4/26/17, 6:09:19 PM] Justin: well thatss an entirely different argument
[4/26/17, 6:09:41 PM] Justin: so its not adding a claim as much as it is pointing out a completely different obsevation
[4/26/17, 6:10:11 PM] Launchpad: simplified even more: 
Good at sex: ‚úî
Bad at sex: ‚ùå
[4/26/17, 6:10:34 PM] Justin: I'm sure sexual compatability is extrmely high up on most people's scale of determining a "mate".  thats completely different though
[4/26/17, 6:11:40 PM] Brian Katz: You just crushed scottys argument with this realization
[4/26/17, 6:21:47 PM] Justin: So completely unrelated I have an app idea
[4/26/17, 6:22:39 PM] Brian Katz: Six minute abs
[4/26/17, 6:22:44 PM] Justin: what about an app that is essentially like grubhub but it automates meal delivery to fit nutritional macros and health
[4/26/17, 6:23:05 PM] Brian Katz: Seven minute abs?
[4/26/17, 6:23:11 PM] Justin: not 6
[4/26/17, 6:24:16 PM] Launchpad: So is it grubhub with a filter or blue apron but cooked?
[4/26/17, 6:24:33 PM] Justin: yeh essentially
[4/26/17, 6:24:50 PM] Justin: its combination of the two with precooked meals instead of make them yourself
[4/26/17, 6:25:14 PM] Justin: in areas like nyc alot of places have to give their nutrional info, so not a bad place to test it
[4/26/17, 6:25:45 PM] Miller: I would say like 70 percent don't
[4/26/17, 6:26:05 PM] Launchpad: More like a business idea that an app idea...
[4/26/17, 6:26:17 PM] Justin: fair enough- kinda both
[4/26/17, 6:27:02 PM] Justin: could have user set ratings requirements, pricing caps etc
[4/26/17, 6:27:35 PM] Justin: think its better than my last idea of aidsdate.com
[4/26/17, 6:27:42 PM] Brian Katz: What about six minute abs? No takers?
[4/26/17, 6:28:00 PM] Miller: I think it's worse actually
[4/26/17, 6:28:25 PM] Miller: Other one is practical and has a logical application with no roadblocks I can see besides users
[4/26/17, 6:28:38 PM] Miller: And clear path to monetization
[4/26/17, 6:29:59 PM] Justin: So your saying there is a chance?
[4/26/17, 6:30:08 PM] Brian Katz: Nice
[4/26/17, 6:30:31 PM] Justin: well monetization would be revenue from ordering food like grubhub does it
[4/26/17, 6:30:57 PM] Miller: Idk how they make money
[4/26/17, 6:31:06 PM] Miller: But presumably margins razer thin
[4/26/17, 6:31:11 PM] Miller: And survive on scale
[4/26/17, 6:31:14 PM] Justin: presumably either they get kickbacks form restuarants or there is fee worked into price
[4/26/17, 6:31:17 PM] Miller: Something your niche wouldn't have
[4/26/17, 6:31:24 PM] Justin: why they are just a middle man
[4/26/17, 6:31:46 PM] Justin: collecting pennies lets say on each order
[4/26/17, 6:31:56 PM] Miller: Yes
[4/26/17, 6:32:30 PM] Miller: But since they aren't limiting themselves to companies who disclose nutritional information and clients who care about that they get millions or orders a day
[4/26/17, 6:33:18 PM] Justin: understandable but wer ealso tlaking about modern metro areas which care much more about shit like that
[4/26/17, 6:33:55 PM] Miller: I'm sure there would be hundreds maybe thousands of people who would use this in NYC for example
[4/26/17, 6:33:59 PM] Justin: dont be shattering my dreasm here
[4/26/17, 6:34:12 PM] Brian Katz: Wer ealso tlaking?
[4/26/17, 6:34:55 PM] Brian Katz: How does you phone not AC your nonsense?
[4/26/17, 6:35:06 PM] Justin: dreams shattered. on computer
[4/26/17, 6:35:24 PM] Miller: And for that reason I'm out
[4/26/17, 7:01:07 PM] Launchpad: http://giantswire.usatoday.com/2017/04/26/new-york-giants-eli-manning-new-emails-no-plan-fabricate-memorabilia/
[4/26/17, 7:01:56 PM] Launchpad: The real scandal in all of this - why the fuck is Eli Manning still using a blackberry in 2012
[4/26/17, 9:33:06 PM] Dan Watts: @16102201963
[4/26/17, 9:38:18 PM] Scott: Lol
[4/26/17, 9:44:02 PM] Miller: Guy must be enrolled at the Goodman school of Facebook jokes
[4/26/17, 9:45:58 PM] Brian Katz: I thought he voted for Gary Johnson
[4/26/17, 10:01:17 PM] Steve: Just played ball, almost got into three fights
[4/26/17, 10:01:21 PM] Steve: It was fantastic
[4/26/17, 10:01:37 PM] Brian Katz: Basket ball
[4/26/17, 10:01:48 PM] Steve: We were playing with two women and they had 3 subs with no women
[4/26/17, 10:02:00 PM] Steve: They had two guys down court cherry picking
[4/26/17, 10:02:18 PM] Steve: It was the sadest thing next to Cheese's little schmeckler I'd ever seen
[4/26/17, 10:02:27 PM] Brian Katz: Are you saying that those women weren't equal to those men? That's sexist steve
[4/26/17, 10:02:36 PM] Steve: Not on our team
[4/26/17, 10:02:47 PM] Steve: Our team has 2 women who absolutely blow
[4/26/17, 10:02:53 PM] Brian Katz: Why would it matter if they were women
[4/26/17, 10:03:03 PM] Steve: Because in this instance they sucked
[4/26/17, 10:03:36 PM] Brian Katz: You have two players that blow, the fact that they were women as nothing to do with it......,lol nah it's because you had some chicks lol
[4/26/17, 10:03:58 PM] Steve: We actually had all of us who sucked
[4/26/17, 10:04:08 PM] Brian Katz: Your good
[4/26/17, 10:04:10 PM] Steve: But I feel like a sexist like you would relate more to women bei on my team
[4/26/17, 10:04:12 PM] Steve: üòò
[4/26/17, 10:04:16 PM] Brian Katz: You're*
[4/26/17, 10:04:18 PM] Steve: üòò
[4/26/17, 10:04:26 PM] Steve: üòò
[4/26/17, 10:04:40 PM] Brian Katz: What?
[4/26/17, 10:08:33 PM] Steve: You you know what
[4/26/17, 10:10:47 PM] Brian Katz: ü§î
[4/26/17, 10:11:20 PM] Brian Katz: üòòback at ya
[4/26/17, 10:11:41 PM] Steve: Keep pondering
[4/26/17, 10:14:03 PM] Brian Katz: I stink at basket ball, but is body any Bitch in the WNBA. Back me down like Shaq
[4/26/17, 10:14:10 PM] Brian Katz: I'd*
[4/26/17, 10:16:23 PM] Steve: I feel like they'd shoot jumpers on you all day
[4/26/17, 10:16:45 PM] Steve: And best you pretty handily
[4/26/17, 10:16:45 PM] Steve: *beat
[4/26/17, 10:17:44 PM] Steve: But in general, women just have a competitive disadvantage against men in sports
[4/26/17, 10:17:44 PM] Steve: In general
[4/26/17, 10:17:45 PM] Steve: Clearly you have exceptions
[4/26/17, 10:19:02 PM] Brian Katz: They would beast me, but I'd back any of em down Shaq style
[4/26/17, 10:20:56 PM] Steve: Yea, until you miss
[4/26/17, 10:20:57 PM] Steve: Then it's over
[4/26/17, 10:30:29 PM] Brian Katz: Big win by the yanks, how those Mets doing miller? Aww down 6
[4/26/17, 10:30:47 PM] Brian Katz: Check that game over
[4/26/17, 10:31:47 PM] Steve: Yanks win yesterday too?
[4/26/17, 10:32:07 PM] Steve: Mets actually look awful
[4/26/17, 10:32:17 PM] Steve: But it's still waaaaay too early
[4/26/17, 10:32:29 PM] Brian Katz: Yanks got rained out yesterday
[4/26/17, 10:32:51 PM] Brian Katz: Can't wait for that hibachi
[4/26/17, 10:33:05 PM] Steve: Me too
[4/26/17, 10:33:14 PM] Steve: Especially after that thunder series
[4/26/17, 10:33:17 PM] Brian Katz: Yours is mvp based
[4/26/17, 10:33:22 PM] Brian Katz: Right?
[4/26/17, 10:33:25 PM] Steve: No way Westbrook loses it
[4/26/17, 10:33:57 PM] Steve: He is the first person to ever score 100 Pts have 50 assists and 50 rebounds in the first five games of a playoff series ever
[4/26/17, 10:34:03 PM] Brian Katz: I can't see how he could lose it. Guy averaged a trip doub a game.... insane
[4/26/17, 10:34:03 PM] Steve: And his team lost in 5
[4/26/17, 10:34:13 PM] Steve: Without him, they are a lottery team
[4/26/17, 10:34:21 PM] Steve: Without harden, rockets still make the playoffs
[4/26/17, 10:34:42 PM] Steve: He broke about 8 records this year
[4/26/17, 10:34:48 PM] Steve: Not including postseason
[4/26/17, 10:35:02 PM] Steve: That hibachi will be sweet
[4/26/17, 10:35:30 PM] Brian Katz: He's my favorite player at this point. He's doing this all on  eff Durant juice
[4/26/17, 10:35:37 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 10:35:51 PM] Steve: And he already said he's staying in OKC for the foreseeable future
[4/26/17, 10:36:01 PM] Steve: They just have to take advantage and put players around him
[4/26/17, 10:36:07 PM] Steve: That team is pathetic when he sits
[4/26/17, 10:36:31 PM] Brian Katz: He should, leaving your team to make a super team is pussy
[4/26/17, 10:36:45 PM] Donk: Oscar robertson didnt win mvp during his triple double season
[4/26/17, 10:36:52 PM] Steve: He didnt
[4/26/17, 10:36:58 PM] Brian Katz: That was pre segregation
[4/26/17, 10:37:12 PM] Donk: Not saying westbrook wont, but its not a slam dunk becaude of it
[4/26/17, 10:37:27 PM] Steve: He did more hen just break a triple double record
[4/26/17, 10:38:03 PM] Donk: What?
[4/26/17, 10:38:06 PM] Steve: Besides the playoff record I just mentioned
[4/26/17, 10:38:28 PM] Donk: Playoffs dont matter for mvp
[4/26/17, 10:38:28 PM] Donk: Voting is done before it
[4/26/17, 10:39:04 PM] Steve: Most 50 point triple doubles in a season
[4/26/17, 10:40:31 PM] Donk: Big o broke that record during his season too
[4/26/17, 10:41:09 PM] Steve: Thirteen of his triple doubles came in three quarters or less
[4/26/17, 10:43:04 PM] Steve: Most points recorded in a triple double
[4/26/17, 10:43:28 PM] Steve: Only player in NBA history to average 40 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists over a 5-game span.
[4/26/17, 10:43:48 PM] Steve: Only player in NBA history to have at least 100 points, 30 rebounds and 30 assists through his team's first three games of a season.

[4/26/17, 10:44:56 PM] Steve: But your right, it isn't a slam dunk
[4/26/17, 10:45:01 PM] Steve: Harden should win it
[4/26/17, 10:45:55 PM] Brian Katz: If harden wins it the MVP is a stupid award

[4/26/17, 10:46:27 PM] Steve: Agreed @16318489683
[4/26/17, 10:46:46 PM] Steve: I might even get a whole bottle of wine to myself at hibachi to celebrate
[4/26/17, 10:47:21 PM] Donk: Lebron should really win it
[4/26/17, 10:47:26 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 10:47:26 PM] Donk: He is the best player
[4/26/17, 10:47:29 PM] Steve: Right
[4/26/17, 10:47:34 PM] Brian Katz: You should get there double shots of sake lol to celebrate
[4/26/17, 10:47:38 PM] Donk: Its the mvp except for lebron award
[4/26/17, 10:47:40 PM] Brian Katz: Three*
[4/26/17, 10:47:50 PM] Steve: Same could be said about other leagues
[4/26/17, 10:47:54 PM] Steve: Trout for baseball
[4/26/17, 10:48:04 PM] Steve: Tom Brady for football
[4/26/17, 10:48:18 PM] Donk: Its just that everyone expects lebron to do what lebron does and takes him for granted
[4/26/17, 10:48:28 PM] Steve: Agreed
[4/26/17, 10:48:40 PM] Steve: I for one have dead taken him for granted in the past
[4/26/17, 10:48:47 PM] Steve: But I try to appreciate how great he is
[4/26/17, 10:49:06 PM] Brian Katz: Watts certainly has........pacers lol
[4/26/17, 10:50:23 PM] Steve: If the rockets were as bad as the thunder without harden, I'd say it would be super close
[4/26/17, 10:50:26 PM] Steve: But it shouldn't be
[4/26/17, 10:50:36 PM] Steve: That rockets team makes the playoffs with or without harden
[4/26/17, 10:51:01 PM] Steve: Which is why they won more games
[4/26/17, 10:51:14 PM] Donk: Maybe, but harden was awesome this year too
[4/26/17, 10:51:22 PM] Steve: Not debating that
[4/26/17, 10:51:25 PM] Donk: Its close
[4/26/17, 10:51:32 PM] Steve: But Westbrook was on another universe
[4/26/17, 10:51:54 PM] Donk: Eh, his usage is out of control to say he was that much better
[4/26/17, 10:52:04 PM] Donk: Id probably give it to westbrook though
[4/26/17, 10:52:12 PM] Steve: His usage?
[4/26/17, 10:52:24 PM] Steve: Guy, he only averaged 35 minutes a game
[4/26/17, 10:52:44 PM] Donk: His team clearing out guys but specifically leaving him the rebounds?
[4/26/17, 10:52:52 PM] Steve: Stop
[4/26/17, 10:52:57 PM] Steve: It's the NBA
[4/26/17, 10:53:04 PM] Donk: Him passing even when the lane was wide opwn to try and get assists
[4/26/17, 10:53:10 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 10:53:14 PM] Steve: Donk the hater
[4/26/17, 10:53:17 PM] Steve: He's back!
[4/26/17, 10:53:17 PM] Donk: Its not like it all came in normal gameflow
[4/26/17, 10:53:27 PM] Donk: Hey, i said id give it to him
[4/26/17, 10:53:38 PM] Steve: No, it was Westbrook crating everything
[4/26/17, 10:53:39 PM] Donk: I just dont think he was in another universe
[4/26/17, 10:53:49 PM] Steve: Hunk about this, the rockets only had to stop him
[4/26/17, 10:53:53 PM] Steve: Literally all they had to do
[4/26/17, 10:54:03 PM] Steve: And he still had three straight triple doubles
[4/26/17, 10:54:25 PM] Steve: You were watching a different NBA season then
[4/26/17, 10:55:13 PM] Steve: Just listed almost ten records and the biggest one that fell after 55 years and you think it was just a great season
[4/26/17, 10:55:31 PM] Donk: Exactly
[4/26/17, 10:55:35 PM] Donk: It was a great season
[4/26/17, 10:55:42 PM] Donk: Which harden also had
[4/26/17, 10:55:46 PM] Steve: It was an unforgettable season
[4/26/17, 10:55:49 PM] Steve: Season for the ages
[4/26/17, 10:55:56 PM] Steve: As an individual player, of course
[4/26/17, 11:00:29 PM] Brian Katz: @13478047760 absolutely @19732079889  you're crazy hating, Westbrook must have snubbed you for an autograph or something.
[4/26/17, 11:02:25 PM] Donk: I said he should win
[4/26/17, 11:02:31 PM] Donk: It was a great season
[4/26/17, 11:02:38 PM] Donk: How is that hating?
[4/26/17, 11:03:14 PM] Brian Katz: Donk: hey Russ can I get an autograph?
Mr Westbrook: nah pussy
[4/26/17, 11:08:14 PM] Steve: Because you are saying harden and Westbrook had equal great seasons
[4/26/17, 11:08:18 PM] Steve: That is hating
[4/26/17, 11:08:22 PM] Steve: They clearly did not
[4/26/17, 11:08:25 PM] Steve: Look at the stats
[4/26/17, 11:08:29 PM] Steve: You are a star guy
[4/26/17, 11:08:46 PM] Steve: Stats
[4/26/17, 11:09:32 PM] Steve: Two things, I don't think Donk would ask Westbrook for an autograph. But if he did, that would be his exact reaction.
[4/26/17, 11:09:46 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/26/17, 11:12:09 PM] Kiyoon: Gonna gree with donk here, I think it's Westbrook but not so cut and dry
[4/26/17, 11:12:33 PM] Steve: Well you all are out your damn minds
[4/26/17, 11:12:40 PM] Steve: Don't really know what more he can do
[4/26/17, 11:12:49 PM] Steve: Win a championship by himself?
[4/26/17, 11:12:55 PM] Steve: Win the one seed by himself?
[4/26/17, 11:13:01 PM] Kiyoon: Again, playoffs not included
[4/26/17, 11:13:07 PM] Steve: Not including playoffs
[4/26/17, 11:13:27 PM] Kiyoon: I think he has a shit roster around him but that's also it, harden makes the other rockets that much better
[4/26/17, 11:13:26 PM] Steve: Did you read the first times in NBA history I rattled off earlier
[4/26/17, 11:13:37 PM] Steve: Playoffs aren't included
[4/26/17, 11:13:43 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 11:13:53 PM] Steve: Without harden whee are the rockets Kiyoon?
[4/26/17, 11:14:02 PM] Steve: With Westbrook where are the thunder?
[4/26/17, 11:14:06 PM] Brian Katz: Kiyoon: hey Russell! Can I get a selfie with you?
Mr Westbrook: me so sorry no speaky English
[4/26/17, 11:14:06 PM] Kiyoon: Also not in the playoffs?
[4/26/17, 11:14:06 PM] Steve: One is a lottery team
[4/26/17, 11:14:14 PM] Steve: The other still makes the playoffs
[4/26/17, 11:14:22 PM] Brian Katz: Hating
[4/26/17, 11:14:24 PM] Kiyoon: OKC probably worst team in the league minus westbrook
[4/26/17, 11:14:25 PM] Steve: You are crazy
[4/26/17, 11:14:36 PM] Steve: They won 47 games lol
[4/26/17, 11:14:49 PM] Steve: They go from worst team in the league to winning almost 50 games
[4/26/17, 11:14:51 PM] Steve: But sure
[4/26/17, 11:14:59 PM] Steve: Harden had an equal season
[4/26/17, 11:15:06 PM] Kiyoon: Also I think Kawhi in discussion too
[4/26/17, 11:15:11 PM] Kiyoon: But prbably distant 3rd
[4/26/17, 11:15:19 PM] Steve: And lebron too
[4/26/17, 11:15:28 PM] Steve: But it should not be close
[4/26/17, 11:15:31 PM] Steve: Of course it will bee
[4/26/17, 11:15:34 PM] Kiyoon: But MVP also includes how your team does in the regular season
[4/26/17, 11:15:36 PM] Steve: Because of this nonesense
[4/26/17, 11:15:44 PM] Kiyoon: It's not all about your pts assists rebounds per game
[4/26/17, 11:15:51 PM] Steve: But you have to factor where the teams would be without them
[4/26/17, 11:16:04 PM] Steve: And the thunder would be the worst team in the league without Westbrook
[4/26/17, 11:16:09 PM] Kiyoon: You think Damien Lillard deserves in the convo on his shit team that made the playoffs?
[4/26/17, 11:16:09 PM] Steve: Not even close with the rockets
[4/26/17, 11:16:24 PM] Kiyoon: Who else on the Rockets anchors that team
[4/26/17, 11:16:24 PM] Steve: I think he should finish top 10
[4/26/17, 11:16:52 PM] Kiyoon: Anthony davis?
[4/26/17, 11:16:57 PM] Kiyoon: Demarcus cousins?
[4/26/17, 11:17:01 PM] Steve: Nene, Ariza, Gordon
[4/26/17, 11:17:15 PM] Steve: Lou Williams
[4/26/17, 11:17:15 PM] Kiyoon: Yes, in 2010 that would have been an all star lineup
[4/26/17, 11:17:18 PM] Steve: Patrick Beverley
[4/26/17, 11:17:31 PM] Steve: Beverly one of the best one on one defenders in the league
[4/26/17, 11:17:42 PM] Steve: Lou Williams probably sixth man of the year
[4/26/17, 11:17:51 PM] Kiyoon: I'd argue oladipo+Adams better than nene + gordon
[4/26/17, 11:17:55 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 11:17:57 PM] Kiyoon: I'll give you beverly
[4/26/17, 11:17:58 PM] Steve: Sit down
[4/26/17, 11:18:09 PM] Steve: Oladipo is still raw
[4/26/17, 11:18:17 PM] Steve: Adams isn't even a true big man
[4/26/17, 11:18:23 PM] Steve: The rockets crushed him down low
[4/26/17, 11:18:25 PM] Kiyoon: You sit down, you just named Nene and EG3 when I asked who else anchora
[4/26/17, 11:18:31 PM] Steve: Literally harden was driving on them at will
[4/26/17, 11:18:43 PM] Kiyoon: Was Westbrook not?
[4/26/17, 11:18:56 PM] Kiyoon: Guess Ariza and Bev not lock down defnders
[4/26/17, 11:18:56 PM] Steve: And then I gave you more and you said "yes, but who else?" Lol
[4/26/17, 11:19:12 PM] Kiyoon: No I said they'd be good in 2010
[4/26/17, 11:19:12 PM] Steve: Westbrook is unstoppable
[4/26/17, 11:19:14 PM] Steve: Clearly
[4/26/17, 11:19:22 PM] Steve: Harden was relatively contained all series
[4/26/17, 11:19:30 PM] Steve: For his standards he actually had a bad series
[4/26/17, 11:19:39 PM] Kiyoon: So nothing to do with Oladipo being a good defender
[4/26/17, 11:19:52 PM] Steve: Westbrook was on him
[4/26/17, 11:19:54 PM] Kiyoon: Westbrook 2 for 15 in the 4th quarter game 1 or 2?
[4/26/17, 11:19:59 PM] Kiyoon: GOAT
[4/26/17, 11:20:02 PM] Steve: That was Beverley
[4/26/17, 11:20:10 PM] Steve: He has theee straight triple doubles lol
[4/26/17, 11:20:19 PM] Steve: First time in NBA history
[4/26/17, 11:20:23 PM] Kiyoon: I think the TD is impressive
[4/26/17, 11:20:27 PM] Steve: Sorry your right, not enough for you and Donk
[4/26/17, 11:20:29 PM] Kiyoon: To average that for the season
[4/26/17, 11:20:40 PM] Steve: He needed to have five straight
[4/26/17, 11:20:53 PM] Steve: And then win the non existent MVP of the series
[4/26/17, 11:20:58 PM] Steve: To get some credit
[4/26/17, 11:21:14 PM] Kiyoon: Harden was a rebound away from averaging a TF
[4/26/17, 11:21:17 PM] Steve: Guy literally can't do more
[4/26/17, 11:21:18 PM] Kiyoon: TD
[4/26/17, 11:21:28 PM] Kiyoon: Distributed the ball more
[4/26/17, 11:21:35 PM] Steve: Because he could
[4/26/17, 11:21:40 PM] Kiyoon: You should take a look at offensive efficiency
[4/26/17, 11:21:43 PM] Steve: Who was Westbrook passing it to?
[4/26/17, 11:21:47 PM] Steve: Adams?
[4/26/17, 11:21:55 PM] Steve: Your vaunted oladipo?
[4/26/17, 11:22:10 PM] Steve: Who bybthe way went 7 for 16 from the field in game 5
[4/26/17, 11:22:14 PM] Steve: The one they lost
[4/26/17, 11:22:17 PM] Kiyoon: So then they must have averaged what
[4/26/17, 11:22:30 PM] Kiyoon: 30 points a game since Westbrook is the only one thay can score?
[4/26/17, 11:22:50 PM] Kiyoon: Thunder start up 60-0 at the tip?
[4/26/17, 11:22:54 PM] Steve: No because they can't make basslets
[4/26/17, 11:22:59 PM] Steve: *baskets
[4/26/17, 11:23:07 PM] Steve: That one of my main points
[4/26/17, 11:23:14 PM] Steve: He has one of the worst rosters around him
[4/26/17, 11:23:29 PM] Steve: Yet he still carries them to 47 wins and a six seed
[4/26/17, 11:23:54 PM] Kiyoon: And Harden carries the Rockets to 3 seed
[4/26/17, 11:24:03 PM] Steve: He had plenty of help
[4/26/17, 11:24:09 PM] Steve: Whether you want to admit now or not
[4/26/17, 11:24:11 PM] Kiyoon: Without harden their a fringe playoff team
[4/26/17, 11:24:17 PM] Steve: That team is a playoff team with or without him
[4/26/17, 11:24:25 PM] Steve: Are they much better than that? No
[4/26/17, 11:24:36 PM] Kiyoon: Can't wait for Kawhi or Harden to win
[4/26/17, 11:24:39 PM] Steve: And that's how much worse than the worst team in the league?
[4/26/17, 11:24:42 PM] Kiyoon: Maybe even LeBron
[4/26/17, 11:24:54 PM] Steve: You want to make a small wager as well?
[4/26/17, 11:25:13 PM] Kiyoon: Now I am rooting against westbrook when I have been a proponent for him all season
[4/26/17, 11:25:24 PM] Steve: So let's bet
[4/26/17, 11:25:33 PM] Steve: Make you even more against him
[4/26/17, 11:25:35 PM] Steve: $20?
[4/26/17, 11:25:42 PM] Steve: A bobble head?
[4/26/17, 11:25:47 PM] Steve: $40?
[4/26/17, 11:25:50 PM] Kiyoon: Bobblehead
[4/26/17, 11:25:50 PM] Steve: $50?
[4/26/17, 11:25:53 PM] Steve: Done
[4/26/17, 11:26:01 PM] Steve: Which one do you want?
[4/26/17, 11:26:03 PM] Kiyoon: Of westbrook or harden
[4/26/17, 11:26:09 PM] Steve: Ok
[4/26/17, 11:26:12 PM] Kiyoon: Well do I get the field or westbrokk
[4/26/17, 11:26:17 PM] Steve: I'd prefer you choosing any
[4/26/17, 11:26:23 PM] Kiyoon: The field?
[4/26/17, 11:26:31 PM] Steve: But I'll bring mini Westbrook to hibachi too
[4/26/17, 11:26:35 PM] Steve: Yea
[4/26/17, 11:26:43 PM] Steve: You can choose any bobblehead
[4/26/17, 11:26:53 PM] Steve: But if you want harden I can do Westbrook
[4/26/17, 11:26:57 PM] Kiyoon: Nah it'll be whoever wins the mvp
[4/26/17, 11:27:03 PM] Steve: Ok
[4/26/17, 11:27:06 PM] Kiyoon: I'll take the field
[4/26/17, 11:27:14 PM] Steve: You need to be someone
[4/26/17, 11:27:29 PM] Steve: It's either harden or Westbrook
[4/26/17, 11:27:35 PM] Steve: Everyone else is really cute and all
[4/26/17, 11:29:17 PM] Kiyoon: Why am I picking westbrook
[4/26/17, 11:29:22 PM] Kiyoon: You're arguing for him
[4/26/17, 11:29:30 PM] Steve: I'm saying you are pickinnharden
[4/26/17, 11:29:35 PM] Steve: Not this field bull
[4/26/17, 11:29:40 PM] Steve: It's between the two of them
[4/26/17, 11:29:41 PM] Kiyoon: Why not
[4/26/17, 11:29:54 PM] Kiyoon: Westbrook is on another universe
[4/26/17, 11:30:00 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/26/17, 11:30:04 PM] Steve: Fine, sure
[4/26/17, 11:30:23 PM] Steve: Just realize you have the rest of the NBA to my one player without giving me odds
[4/26/17, 11:30:33 PM] Steve: It's going to be so sweet
[4/26/17, 11:30:44 PM] Steve: Like taking picks from a Kiyoon
[4/26/17, 11:43:18 PM] Justin: Not how odds work
[4/26/17, 11:44:55 PM] Steve: Don't worry about what I'm doing here Herman
[4/27/17, 6:23:51 AM] Miller: Mvp announcement isn't until end of June
[4/27/17, 6:24:20 AM] Miller: And literally everyone who gets paid full time to cover basketball professionally thinks either harden is the mvp or its close
[4/27/17, 6:24:42 AM] Miller: But you two probably know more, I'm sure you watched at least 2 games during the regular season
[4/27/17, 6:24:53 AM] Miller: To say Westbrook wasn't stat padding is a joke
[4/27/17, 6:26:05 AM] Miller: Let's do this hibachi 7/15, if Westbrook wins I'll pay both out and if harden wins Steve can just pay for katz
[4/27/17, 6:29:07 AM] Brian Katz: I'm glad you've given up on the Mets. Even though it's only April, it's good to see you realize he legit the Tanks are, and how garbage the Mets are.
[4/27/17, 6:29:18 AM] Brian Katz: How*
[4/27/17, 6:29:25 AM] Brian Katz: Yanks*
[4/27/17, 8:06:04 AM] Brian Katz: I've read into to the origins of the words retarded, moronic, idiotic. Retarded is a Medical term. It can also be used like this( the medicine retarded the virus". While moronic and idiotic, are slurs for the slow, or dumb. So when you @13478047760 say that using the word retarded is offensive, and we should use other words, such as idiotic, moronic, it's actually being more offensive. So the PC culture should stop getting "butt hurt" over words because of emotion, and actually do research into what the origins of the words are. Mostly these words are offensive because of the ways they are used, and not the actual word itself. That's why I'm saying to never censor our words, but how we use them.
[4/27/17, 8:07:14 AM] Steve: But that's not what it's used for now
[4/27/17, 8:07:31 AM] Steve: Did you use the word retarded to mean a medical term?
[4/27/17, 8:07:37 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/27/17, 8:07:49 AM] Steve: Katz, you're reaching.
[4/27/17, 8:07:53 AM] Steve: Use whatever words you want
[4/27/17, 8:08:16 AM] Brian Katz: No im not, this conversation is retarded
[4/27/17, 8:08:22 AM] Brian Katz: That's how it was used
[4/27/17, 8:08:31 AM] Brian Katz: I'm not teaching you are
[4/27/17, 8:08:37 AM] Brian Katz: Reaching*
[4/27/17, 8:10:05 AM] Brian Katz: And even if I saw a retarded kid and called him retarded it's use is proper. If I called him moronic or idiotic, I'd be using a slur. I'm just calling a spade a spade hear snowflake
[4/27/17, 8:11:34 AM] Steve: Whatever makes you feel good
[4/27/17, 8:11:36 AM] Steve: I wasn't censoring anyone's words
[4/27/17, 8:11:36 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/27/17, 8:11:37 AM] Steve: You calling me a snowflake?
[4/27/17, 8:11:42 AM] Steve: Who's still bringing this argument up?
[4/27/17, 8:12:48 AM] Brian Katz: I am
[4/27/17, 8:13:25 AM] Brian Katz: And yes I'm calling you a snowflake, which is a slur against PC pussies lol
[4/27/17, 8:15:35 AM] Steve: That's like cheese telling someone they are weak.
[4/27/17, 8:15:52 AM] Scott: Steve u are weak
[4/27/17, 8:16:05 AM] Steve: You should look also look up snowflake. You aren't using it right.
[4/27/17, 8:16:12 AM] Steve: What sources you using?
[4/27/17, 8:16:13 AM] Steve: I'd start with Webster then move my way to Fox News.
[4/27/17, 8:16:14 AM] Steve: Side note, fuck the giants picks tonight and I hope they all fail.
[4/27/17, 8:17:18 AM] Steve: üßÄbringing theüî®üîª
[4/27/17, 8:18:15 AM] Brian Katz: Gmen forever
[4/27/17, 8:19:10 AM] Steve: ‚¨á*
[4/27/17, 8:19:37 AM] Steve: So men like gscott?
[4/27/17, 8:20:01 AM] Brian Katz: Okay you're not a snowflake yet, but you're headed down that path.
[4/27/17, 8:21:43 AM] Steve: Things going wrong? I hope for it.
[4/27/17, 8:22:53 AM] Dan Watts: Fuck Westbrook harden all day
[4/27/17, 8:22:59 AM] Steve: Lol
[4/27/17, 8:23:11 AM] Brian Katz: Late to that one lol
[4/27/17, 8:23:45 AM] Steve: Figures, guy joining forces with his pong partner
[4/27/17, 8:23:48 AM] Dan Watts: Dan Watts MVP voting
[4/27/17, 8:23:55 AM] Steve: Want to wager on this as well wizz?
[4/27/17, 8:24:08 AM] Brian Katz: I don't get the harden debate? Like Westbrook may have had the best season of all time, and there's a serious debate of who should win the MVP? Stop it
[4/27/17, 8:25:20 AM] Dan Watts: 1) Harden 2) lebron  3) kawiah 4) isiah Thomas 5) Westbrook
[4/27/17, 8:27:51 AM] Dan Watts: I think if you put lebron, curry, harden or a number of others on that thunder team and let that player shoot 40+ times a game you'd see the same results
[4/27/17, 8:27:53 AM] Brian Katz: Watts: can I get a pic Mr Westbrook? 
Mr Westbrook: nah, but your bitch can!
[4/27/17, 8:30:45 AM] Steve: Katz, you just don't get it. Stat padding.
[4/27/17, 8:31:11 AM] Steve: So let's bet watts
[4/27/17, 8:31:17 AM] Steve: Harden v Westbrook
[4/27/17, 8:31:23 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah it's a conspiracy by the whole NBA to make one guy look Great.
[4/27/17, 8:32:49 AM] Miller: i mean instead of just going zomg triple doubles this is so amazing you could try to look into why lots of respected nba analysts think its either A) harden or B) very close
[4/27/17, 8:33:42 AM] Steve: Padded stats katz
[4/27/17, 8:33:43 AM] Steve: We have no argument
[4/27/17, 8:33:58 AM] Miller: The Thunder built a team of defense-first finishers around two superstars. One superstar left. They had no time or money to build another sort of team. They needed everything Westbrook could give on offense, and he gave them everything he had.

So why is he behind Harden here, by the slimmest of (mandated) margins? They really had the same season, in different contexts. One guy had the ball all the time surrounded by good 3-point shooters, and he passed more. One guy had the ball all the time surrounded by, umm, 2-point shooters, and attempted six more shots per game. Most of those extra shots were 2s, which is why Harden has a bigger edge in shooting efficiency -- true shooting, and adjusted field-goal percentage -- than the raw percentages indicate.

Would Westbrook pass more if they flipped teammates? Probably. He is a spread pick-and-roll point guard in search of some spread. He knows where shooters are, and he can make almost any pass with either hand.

On the flip side, Harden has the physicality, grit, and guile to drag this same Thunder roster to a win total in the mid-40s. He fell two rebounds short of averaging a triple-double, but his stat line is an historical outlier just the same. One free throw rebound and one uncontested defensive board per night don't, on their own, make Westbrook a superior candidate.

Harden gave up the ball a little more readily, and played with a bit more variety. Most assistant and head coaches I spoke to say, privately, that Harden is harder to game plan against -- that he's craftier, and less predictable than Westbrook's battering-ram approach. A lot of that stems from Harden having actual outside shooters around him. But I don't think that explains all of it, and even if it does, it is the reality with which we are presented.

It dovetails with the feeling I had all season that Westbrook bent the game to a (slightly) uncomfortable extreme: the highest usage rate ever, monopolization of the offense. It's easy, and mostly right, to say he had to do that on this roster. It's also reductive. It ends the conversation. It refuses to even entertain the possibility that other players might have benefited in the long run from Westbrook loosening his grip on the offense by 5 percent. Maybe it makes no difference. Maybe it makes the Thunder worse this season. I don't know. But the usage rate gives me pause.
[4/27/17, 8:34:15 AM] Miller: that is zach lowe, sr nba writer for ESPN (hes no steve/katz of course)
[4/27/17, 8:34:43 AM] Miller: https://www.si.com/nba/2017/03/27/james-harden-nba-mvp-case-rockets-russell-westbrook too long to paste
[4/27/17, 8:34:54 AM] Brian Katz: Miller: hey Russ can I get an autograph for my kid?
Mr Westbrook: sure, it's for your kid
[4/27/17, 8:35:10 AM] Miller: if either of you legitimately think its not close and there is no argument that is ignorant
[4/27/17, 8:35:56 AM] Brian Katz: ESPN is becoming a defunct entity at this point. They are writing things that are crazy so that they get more readers.
[4/27/17, 8:35:58 AM] Dan Watts: I personally prefer harden and think he's more deserving , but I think Westbrook will win
[4/27/17, 8:36:35 AM] Dan Watts: He averaged a triple double of course he should win! Starts are not enough
[4/27/17, 8:36:35 AM] Brian Katz: When Russ eventually wins are we going to have to hear all this non sense still?
[4/27/17, 8:36:40 AM] Dan Watts: Stats*
[4/27/17, 8:36:46 AM] Brian Katz: They aren't?
[4/27/17, 8:37:11 AM] Brian Katz: His team made the playoffs in the west, and if he was eastern team he'd had them in the 3 seed
[4/27/17, 8:37:28 AM] Miller: im not saying russ ISNT going to win or that if he wins he doesnt deserve it
[4/27/17, 8:37:35 AM] Steve: So watts?
[4/27/17, 8:37:36 AM] Miller: im saying you can easily make a legitimate case for harden
[4/27/17, 8:37:40 AM] Steve: What are we betting?
[4/27/17, 8:37:45 AM] Brian Katz: Nah not this year
[4/27/17, 8:37:54 AM] Steve: I want to add to my bobblehead collection
[4/27/17, 8:38:22 AM] Brian Katz: Wow they used the best player in the NBA a lot
[4/27/17, 8:38:35 AM] Miller: lol okay
[4/27/17, 8:38:37 AM] Miller: youre right katz
[4/27/17, 8:38:43 AM] Brian Katz: Thank you
[4/27/17, 8:38:44 AM] Miller: everyone who follows the NBA for a living is wrong
[4/27/17, 8:38:46 AM] Miller: and you are right
[4/27/17, 8:38:49 AM] Donk: Lol
[4/27/17, 8:38:51 AM] Brian Katz: Thank you
[4/27/17, 8:39:03 AM] Steve: I trust in the katz
[4/27/17, 8:39:10 AM] Brian Katz: Thank you too lol
[4/27/17, 8:39:20 AM] Miller: im sure you and the 2 or 3 thunder games you watched this year and knowledge of how to calculate true shooting % knows better
[4/27/17, 8:39:46 AM] Steve: Katz, don't worry, you can have some of my sake
[4/27/17, 8:39:55 AM] Steve: It's on Miller
[4/27/17, 8:39:58 AM] Miller: classic steve/katz
[4/27/17, 8:40:09 AM] Miller: say something that is a legitimate debate/coinflip isnt close
[4/27/17, 8:40:13 AM] Miller: so if you win you can say see i told you so
[4/27/17, 8:40:17 AM] Miller: im so smart it was so obvious
[4/27/17, 8:40:19 AM] Brian Katz: I'm not calculating percentages like some nerd, Russ blasted the NBA and had maybe the best season if all time.
[4/27/17, 8:40:36 AM] Steve: He was only great
[4/27/17, 8:40:40 AM] Steve: Stat padding
[4/27/17, 8:40:48 AM] Brian Katz: That's an understatement steve
[4/27/17, 8:40:58 AM] Steve: We should look up stat padding
[4/27/17, 8:41:01 AM] Brian Katz: I would say he was amazing
[4/27/17, 8:41:05 AM] Steve: As a group
[4/27/17, 8:41:14 AM] Miller: so ill bet you, if russ wins you get $100 if harden wins i get $1000
[4/27/17, 8:41:23 AM] Miller: only 10-1 odds which seems low for this kind of slam dunk
[4/27/17, 8:41:27 AM] Steve: I just want hibachi
[4/27/17, 8:41:33 AM] Steve: But I'll take a bobblehead too
[4/27/17, 8:41:35 AM] Brian Katz: Nah that's a Bitch bet
[4/27/17, 8:41:40 AM] Brian Katz: Reverse that
[4/27/17, 8:41:49 AM] Brian Katz: If you're so confident it's close
[4/27/17, 8:42:00 AM] Steve: I don't want two Russ bobblehead though
[4/27/17, 8:42:07 AM] Miller: sure ill bet you harden gets at least 25% of 1st place votes
[4/27/17, 8:42:08 AM] Steve: Devonta Freeman
[4/27/17, 8:42:16 AM] Brian Katz: Nope who wins
[4/27/17, 8:42:16 AM] Steve: I'm sure he will
[4/27/17, 8:42:21 AM] Steve: I'm sure it will be close
[4/27/17, 8:42:25 AM] Steve: But it shouldn't be
[4/27/17, 8:42:31 AM] Miller: b/c you guys know better
[4/27/17, 8:42:32 AM] Brian Katz: I'm sure their are hater voters out there
[4/27/17, 8:42:32 AM] Miller: got it
[4/27/17, 8:42:36 AM] Miller: ah yes
[4/27/17, 8:42:41 AM] Miller: everyone who disagrees is a hater
[4/27/17, 8:42:43 AM] Miller: rule #4 of this chat
[4/27/17, 8:42:48 AM] Brian Katz: I'll bet 100 straight up
[4/27/17, 8:42:53 AM] Steve: No, just you.
[4/27/17, 8:42:56 AM] Steve: Not everyone
[4/27/17, 8:43:03 AM] Miller: yes im the only one who disagrees
[4/27/17, 8:43:17 AM] Miller: by deferring to people who i acknowledge are substantially more informed than me on this subject
[4/27/17, 8:43:24 AM] Brian Katz: Hating
[4/27/17, 8:43:49 AM] Miller: unlike some people im not gonna sit here and pretend i know enough about either team or player to have a strong opinion on it
[4/27/17, 8:43:53 AM] Miller: but herp derp triple doubles
[4/27/17, 8:44:08 AM] Brian Katz: That's Bitch talk
[4/27/17, 8:44:11 AM] Steve: You having a seizure?
[4/27/17, 8:45:30 AM] Miller: too bad the rockets didnt let harden get 2 more RPG a game so he could maaaaybe have a chance
[4/27/17, 8:45:35 AM] Steve: Let us know, we can get help.
[4/27/17, 8:45:39 AM] Brian Katz: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gqRYH5JdcRA

[4/27/17, 8:46:26 AM] Miller: guys the truth
[4/27/17, 8:47:29 AM] Brian Katz: Watch the video it's actually awesome
[4/27/17, 8:48:21 AM] Miller: i actually think they should change the rules and give it to lamelo ball
[4/27/17, 8:48:26 AM] Miller: he scored 100 points in a game
[4/27/17, 8:48:32 AM] Steve: I'm drafting ramsus at the 12
[4/27/17, 8:48:35 AM] Miller: and w/o him his team would have been last in the southern california hs league
[4/27/17, 8:48:38 AM] Dan Watts: Don't start posting videos, I got lagarette Blount videos for days
[4/27/17, 8:49:33 AM] Steve: I want a hit of that Blount too...4th rounder?
[4/27/17, 8:49:48 AM] Miller: this is basically trout vs miggy from a few years ago
[4/27/17, 8:49:50 AM] Steve: Miller, you had me at ramsus
[4/27/17, 8:50:18 AM] Miller: trout was the better player, worse team, but miggy hit for the triple crown
[4/27/17, 8:50:22 AM] Brian Katz: Made 2 yard tds in that highlight vid lol
[4/27/17, 8:50:51 AM] Brian Katz: No ones done that since ted Williams, it's more impressive
[4/27/17, 8:50:57 AM] Miller: of course
[4/27/17, 8:51:06 AM] Brian Katz: So he had more steals
[4/27/17, 8:51:07 AM] Miller: not totally arbitrary
[4/27/17, 8:51:41 AM] Brian Katz: You lead the league in the three major categories, and you're not the MVP?
[4/27/17, 8:52:16 AM] Brian Katz: This sabe metric world is retarded
[4/27/17, 8:52:40 AM] Miller: yes get off my lawn, defense and speed are irrelevant, RBIs are a real thing
[4/27/17, 8:52:58 AM] Steve: Stop avoiding me @watts
[4/27/17, 8:52:58 AM] Steve: @17189742074
[4/27/17, 8:52:58 AM] Steve: We bobbleheading it?
[4/27/17, 8:53:05 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah you can't win games with no runs
[4/27/17, 8:53:34 AM] Steve: Did you mean sabermetrics has a medical condition?
[4/27/17, 8:53:41 AM] Steve: I just want to be clear how you are using the word
[4/27/17, 8:54:26 AM] Steve: Don't want my snowflake brain to get confused, it's sensitive
[4/27/17, 8:58:04 AM] Donk: Wrong
[4/27/17, 8:58:15 AM] Donk: You mean Carl yastremski
[4/27/17, 8:58:59 AM] Brian Katz: I knew it was some Red Sox lame-o
[4/27/17, 8:59:19 AM] Brian Katz: And yes @13478047760 I meant it was mentally handicapped
[4/27/17, 9:06:26 AM] Dan Watts: @13478047760 I'm not. As I said earlier I personally like harden better but I think Westbrook is going to win
[4/27/17, 9:18:30 AM] Scott: Draft that motion for u watts for blount?
[4/27/17, 9:18:30 AM] Scott: Maybe also a letter of recommendation for law school
[4/27/17, 9:18:32 AM] Scott: ?
[4/27/17, 9:19:57 AM] Donk: Sabermaterics are mentally handicapped?
[4/27/17, 9:20:26 AM] Steve: @16318489683 you know thats the offensive version right?
[4/27/17, 9:32:47 AM] Brian Katz: Bust
[4/27/17, 9:33:11 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah I'm aware
[4/27/17, 9:33:29 AM] Brian Katz: I'm not a snowflake so it doesn't bother me
[4/27/17, 9:33:41 AM] Donk: I want watson to go to the bills at 10
[4/27/17, 9:34:03 AM] Brian Katz: I think they're taking mike Williams
[4/27/17, 9:34:18 AM] Donk: I hope not
[4/27/17, 9:37:22 AM] Steve: You actually are the definition
[4/27/17, 9:37:41 AM] Steve: As your #morninrant proved
[4/27/17, 9:37:47 AM] Steve: It's ok, we'll accept you
[4/27/17, 9:41:44 AM] Miller: anyone else besides steve coming to watch the draft tonight? just lmk asap as possible bc im making a reservation

[4/27/17, 9:45:06 AM] Miller: are you going to be there at 8?
[4/27/17, 9:45:21 AM] Scott: Yes I should be there at 8
[4/27/17, 9:45:38 AM] Scott: Add me to it
[4/27/17, 9:45:42 AM] Miller: k

[4/27/17, 9:56:52 AM] Miller: ironically they reported earnings today
[4/27/17, 9:57:32 AM] Sean: Damn Famous Daves
[4/27/17, 9:58:33 AM] Brian Katz: @15166335046 it's BDubs
[4/27/17, 10:00:00 AM] Kiyoon: Famous Daves was ggood the first 3 times I tired it

[4/27/17, 10:03:36 AM] Brian Katz: Famous daves is bomb
[4/27/17, 10:03:48 AM] Brian Katz: Boneless wings are the best
[4/27/17, 10:06:41 AM] Sean: Yeah we have changes so much shit over the past 3 years. They're finally going back to all the original recipes and specs
[4/27/17, 10:06:53 AM] Donk: Its decent chain bbq
[4/27/17, 10:12:42 AM] Brian Katz: I've been tracking my weight the last few months, and it's been pretty consistent with ups and downs. I got ill this week and I've never tracked myself while being ill before. I lost 8lbs in 3 days. I was wondering if anyone else in here has ever tracked this, and had a similar result?
[4/27/17, 10:13:06 AM] Miller: seems pretty normal
[4/27/17, 10:13:27 AM] Sean: I lost 15 pounds when I was sick once but literally hardly ate for like 5 days
[4/27/17, 10:13:30 AM] Brian Katz: Damn, I never realized how much a cold took out of you before.
[4/27/17, 10:13:33 AM] Sean: Thought I had HIV
[4/27/17, 10:13:45 AM] Miller: yea its why everyone says you need to drink more fluids
[4/27/17, 10:13:46 AM] Brian Katz: I don't think HIV works like that lol
[4/27/17, 10:13:50 AM] Miller: bc you get so dehydrated
[4/27/17, 10:13:54 AM] Brian Katz: True
[4/27/17, 10:13:56 AM] Sean: Lol it doesn't but I freaked out
[4/27/17, 10:14:01 AM] Miller: craziest was i lost 40lbs when i had mono, but that was over a month or so
[4/27/17, 10:14:08 AM] Miller: i was like 140lbs
[4/27/17, 10:14:09 AM] Brian Katz: I've been drinking at least 100 ounces of water a day
[4/27/17, 10:14:21 AM] Miller: also the first time i ever met nicoles mom
[4/27/17, 10:14:22 AM] Brian Katz: Wow
[4/27/17, 10:14:38 AM] Brian Katz: She must of thought you were ghastly lol
[4/27/17, 10:14:45 AM] Miller: yea somehow she still liked me
[4/27/17, 10:14:47 AM] Brian Katz: What you walk around at miller?
[4/27/17, 10:14:54 AM] Miller: these days right around 200
[4/27/17, 10:15:05 AM] Brian Katz: Back then around 180?
[4/27/17, 10:15:12 AM] Miller: yea i was 180 mostly all of college
[4/27/17, 10:15:20 AM] Miller: then went to 220 ~4 years out of college
[4/27/17, 10:15:23 AM] Miller: at my fattest
[4/27/17, 10:15:37 AM] Miller: then started working out and figuring out how to eat etc....
[4/27/17, 10:15:59 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah drinking and late night eating killed me for years
[4/27/17, 10:16:42 AM] Miller: yea its crazy b/c its not like i was drinking more the 4 years post-college than i was the 4 years in college but the sitting at at a desk for 10-12 hours a day vs doing w/e stupid shit we were doing in college was just a huge difference in my metabolism
[4/27/17, 10:17:01 AM] Brian Katz: Absolutely
[4/27/17, 10:17:21 AM] Miller: my dr was fat shaming me hes like you gained 40lbs in 4 years? i was like yea thanks buddy i realized
[4/27/17, 10:17:38 AM] Brian Katz: I really ballooned up when I stopped playing sports regularly and started eating more because I was smoking lol
[4/27/17, 10:17:47 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/27/17, 10:20:12 AM] Steve: Sean gets a cold, thinks he has HIV
[4/27/17, 10:20:15 AM] Steve: Good to know
[4/27/17, 10:20:23 AM] Steve: A lot of things to process today
[4/27/17, 10:21:20 AM] Brian Katz: He gets the sniffles omg I have full blown AIDS!!!!! Lol
[4/27/17, 12:20:54 PM] Justin: 40 pounds in 4 years ive done that multiple times in a year lol
[4/27/17, 12:21:26 PM] Justin: anyone see these ridley scott alien clips, pretty cool http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15439452/alien-covenant-prologue-prometheus-ridley-scott-watch?yptr=yahoo
[4/27/17, 12:21:41 PM] Justin: didnt realize danny mcbride james franco and brie larson in new one
[4/27/17, 12:21:48 PM] Miller: promotheus was fucking terrible
[4/27/17, 12:22:00 PM] Justin: i didnt think it was that bad
[4/27/17, 12:22:12 PM] Justin: although i barely remember it so it clearly wasnt good
[4/27/17, 12:22:22 PM] Miller: well you generically like everything so if you didnt think it was good that is bad
[4/27/17, 12:22:31 PM] Justin: fair
[4/27/17, 12:22:31 PM] Miller: herman grading scale
[4/27/17, 12:22:31 PM] Miller: big curve
[4/27/17, 12:23:01 PM] Justin: https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/23/14707658/watch-alien-covenant-prologue
[4/27/17, 12:23:08 PM] Justin: thats clip with new crew
[4/27/17, 12:29:59 PM] Brian Katz: I liked that movie
[4/27/17, 12:31:04 PM] Donk: I liked it too
[4/27/17, 12:31:36 PM] Donk: It was better than aliens 4
[4/27/17, 12:32:19 PM] Donk: Crazy that the first three movies had ridley scott, james cameron and david fincher as directors
[4/27/17, 12:32:25 PM] Donk: Hard to top that
[4/27/17, 12:41:21 PM] Launchpad: I didn't realize Prometheus was an Aliens movie
[4/27/17, 12:43:06 PM] Launchpad: anyone watch the show Mr. Robot?
[4/27/17, 12:43:09 PM] Launchpad: Herman would love it
[4/27/17, 12:43:56 PM] Donk: Yeah, its great
[4/27/17, 12:44:10 PM] Donk: Though season 2 was a step down from season 1
[4/27/17, 12:44:43 PM] Donk: And did you see Prometheus??
[4/27/17, 12:44:59 PM] Donk: If so, how could you not know it was an aliens movie?
[4/27/17, 12:45:03 PM] Miller: i did not like season 2 of mr robot
[4/27/17, 12:45:08 PM] Miller: s1 was amazing
[4/27/17, 12:45:18 PM] Launchpad: lol no I didn't see it
[4/27/17, 12:45:18 PM] Miller: eh i could see not knowing promotheus was an alien movie
[4/27/17, 12:45:31 PM] Donk: Oh ok, that makes sense then
[4/27/17, 12:45:45 PM] Launchpad: last one I saw was Alien vs Predator
[4/27/17, 12:59:57 PM] Scott: lol
[4/27/17, 1:00:05 PM] Launchpad: bingo gentrified?
[4/27/17, 1:03:02 PM] Tk: The mayor response was hailarious. You could tell he thought it was bs too "we appreciate the acknowlement  and crime has gone down but more data is needed to support those studies".
[4/27/17, 1:05:01 PM] Launchpad: translation: Don't be hitchhiking at night on Stuyvesant ST
[4/27/17, 1:06:45 PM] Tk: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ or Clinton st, or Marther street, or the whole southside. In reality, Bingo is relatively safe, apart from selected areas, but Def not top 20.
[4/27/17, 1:10:54 PM] Kiyoon: yeah Ive watched prometheus like 3 times and had no idea it was an alien movie
[4/27/17, 1:11:02 PM] Kiyoon: Aliens series.  Totally makes sense though
[4/27/17, 1:13:51 PM] Miller: better question why tf have you seen that movie 3x
[4/27/17, 1:15:13 PM] Kiyoon: its on FX  alot
[4/27/17, 1:15:29 PM] Donk: I just dont see not knowing its an aliens movie if you have seen the other ones
[4/27/17, 1:15:37 PM] Donk: 1, there is an alien at the end lol
[4/27/17, 1:16:06 PM] Donk: Secondly, alll of the other things - the robots white blood, weyland corp, etc etc
[4/27/17, 1:16:18 PM] Kiyoon: I haven't really seen the Alien series
[4/27/17, 1:16:22 PM] Kiyoon: I've seen Alien V Predator
[4/27/17, 1:16:29 PM] Donk: The worst one lol
[4/27/17, 1:16:31 PM] Miller: yea i only saw the first alien move and it was a while ago
[4/27/17, 1:16:37 PM] Donk: Go watch aliens 1 through 3
[4/27/17, 1:17:08 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html
[4/27/17, 1:17:22 PM] Dan Watts: did @15166335046 post this earlier? have new hermaned myself?
[4/27/17, 1:17:49 PM] Miller: nope
[4/27/17, 1:17:57 PM] Dan Watts: nice
[4/27/17, 1:17:59 PM] Dan Watts: go Harden
[4/27/17, 1:18:49 PM] Dan Watts: they should call me james because i'm going harden this bitch
[4/27/17, 1:38:41 PM] Justin: really looking for the PCU scene where jeremy piven tells the guy majoring in phys ed to just get out, instead
[4/27/17, 2:03:07 PM] Kiyoon: I think I only saw it while it was on FX
[4/27/17, 2:03:11 PM] Kiyoon: I have no real interest in that series
[4/27/17, 2:20:26 PM] Donk: Probably because you watched the worst ones
[4/27/17, 2:20:48 PM] Donk: First three all great
[4/27/17, 2:37:56 PM] Miller: damn $2 shots? thats pretty sweet
[4/27/17, 2:39:22 PM] Kiyoon: I've been disappointed at how much he hasn't posted on FB
[4/27/17, 3:38:26 PM] Brian Katz: Draft tonight, who's psyched?
[4/27/17, 3:39:23 PM] Miller: more psyched about drinking but sure both are good
[4/27/17, 3:40:09 PM] Brian Katz: Well I guess it's more relevant to the guys with top draft picks
[4/27/17, 3:40:23 PM] Miller: arrogant katz
[4/27/17, 3:40:32 PM] Miller: only i can enjoy the nfl draft b/c of my draft picks
[4/27/17, 3:40:42 PM] Brian Katz: No watts and Donk
[4/27/17, 3:40:48 PM] Brian Katz: Woods*
[4/27/17, 3:41:33 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese is salivating over who he will draft with the 2nd round 9th pick lol
[4/27/17, 3:41:57 PM] Launchpad: And kiyoon too
[4/27/17, 3:41:57 PM] Kiyoon: Miller did you stop drinking beer?
[4/27/17, 3:42:03 PM] Launchpad: Not!
[4/27/17, 3:42:23 PM] Miller: no why
[4/27/17, 3:42:45 PM] Kiyoon: you just really seem to be looking forward to drinking beer
[4/27/17, 3:42:55 PM] Miller: been one of those weeks
[4/27/17, 3:43:08 PM] Kiyoon: thought you were on the TK diet with me
[4/27/17, 3:43:12 PM] Miller: its either drink a lot of beer or go take a bath with a toaster
[4/27/17, 3:43:25 PM] Brian Katz: You're not drinking Kiyoon?
[4/27/17, 3:43:31 PM] Kiyoon: no I am
[4/27/17, 3:43:33 PM] Kiyoon: not drinking beer though
[4/27/17, 3:43:36 PM] Kiyoon: just clear liquor
[4/27/17, 3:43:38 PM] Kiyoon: and no pizza
[4/27/17, 3:43:42 PM] Brian Katz: Watching those carbs?
[4/27/17, 3:43:53 PM] Kiyoon: just the beer carbs
[4/27/17, 3:44:02 PM] Brian Katz: And the pizza carbs
[4/27/17, 3:44:09 PM] Brian Katz: The two best carbs imo
[4/27/17, 3:44:14 PM] Kiyoon: for sure
[4/27/17, 3:44:22 PM] Kiyoon: I dont miss the beer that much
[4/27/17, 3:44:27 PM] Kiyoon: the pizza been hard though
[4/27/17, 3:44:54 PM] Brian Katz: Truth
[4/27/17, 3:45:10 PM] Brian Katz: I have that every cheat day
[4/27/17, 3:49:50 PM] Miller: i have become something of a pizza connoisseur
[4/27/17, 4:07:03 PM] Brian Katz: Oh La la Mr I make pizza now
[4/27/17, 4:14:14 PM] Miller: thats  mr mr i make pizza now to you
[4/27/17, 4:16:38 PM] Justin: just watching a clip of best 1st roudn draft picks, cant believe packers took rodgers
[4/27/17, 4:16:45 PM] Justin: ballsy
[4/27/17, 4:17:03 PM] Justin: unless they had multiple picks that yeat
[4/27/17, 4:17:10 PM] Donk: Eh, 22nd pick
[4/27/17, 4:17:13 PM] Donk: Not that ballsy
[4/27/17, 4:17:29 PM] Justin: still giving up your first for a backup
[4/27/17, 4:17:45 PM] Donk: Still not that ballsy imo
[4/27/17, 4:17:50 PM] Donk: And its not giving up
[4/27/17, 4:17:58 PM] Donk: Its future planning
[4/27/17, 4:18:44 PM] Donk: For example, i think itll be ballsier if cleveland takes trubiisky number 1 tonight
[4/27/17, 4:18:45 PM] Brian Katz: He was projected to go number 1 and farce was in his late 30s
[4/27/17, 4:19:34 PM] Donk: Or when atlanta traded the farm to move up for julio
[4/27/17, 4:19:46 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o1oOEqCaWE
[4/27/17, 4:19:52 PM] Justin: he was projected to go 1 overall and fell to 23?
[4/27/17, 4:20:11 PM] Donk: It was going to be him or alex smith at 1 to san fran
[4/27/17, 4:20:25 PM] Justin: ouch
[4/27/17, 4:20:27 PM] Donk: When san fran went smith, rodgers fell for whatever reason
[4/27/17, 4:24:15 PM] Brian Katz: Crabtree fell
[4/27/17, 4:24:27 PM] Brian Katz: The olineman last year that was smoking the Shwag fell
[4/27/17, 5:13:29 PM] Dan Watts: Jets looking at OJ Howard
[4/27/17, 5:13:40 PM] Dan Watts: So is the kid @1.13
[4/27/17, 5:14:43 PM] Miller: id start making plan B
[4/27/17, 5:14:57 PM] Brian Katz: No way he makes it that far
[4/27/17, 5:14:58 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/27/17, 5:15:04 PM] Steve: Another Kenyan drake pick
[4/27/17, 5:15:35 PM] Brian Katz: I heard he's going to buffalo
[4/27/17, 5:15:38 PM] Steve: Didn't someone pick a crap tight end in the first round too?
[4/27/17, 5:16:08 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty picked the San Diego guy who had an okay rookie year
[4/27/17, 5:16:12 PM] Donk: It was henry at 1.12
[4/27/17, 5:16:21 PM] Brian Katz: Will be better sans gates
[4/27/17, 5:16:22 PM] Donk: Turned out to be a good pick
[4/27/17, 5:16:56 PM] Donk: And 0% chance howard lasts until 1.13
[4/27/17, 5:17:13 PM] Miller: just traded for henry in another lg
[4/27/17, 5:17:14 PM] Brian Katz: He's gone top 6
[4/27/17, 5:17:43 PM] Brian Katz: I think he's good
[4/27/17, 5:18:08 PM] Brian Katz: I'd like hooper to take that next step this year.
[4/27/17, 5:18:50 PM] Steve: He did end up being a good pick
[4/27/17, 5:18:54 PM] Steve: Didn't realize it was him
[4/27/17, 5:19:01 PM] Dan Watts: Taking that next step out of the league
[4/27/17, 5:19:02 PM] Steve: Thought it was more of a Kenyan drake pick
[4/27/17, 5:19:29 PM] Brian Katz: He did catch a touchdown in the Super Bowl
[4/27/17, 5:19:54 PM] Steve: Unfortunately he didn't catch the first one
[4/27/17, 5:19:59 PM] Steve: Could have used that prop bet
[4/27/17, 5:20:04 PM] Dan Watts: Don't sleep on drizzy
[4/27/17, 5:20:10 PM] Launchpad: I had Gates handcuff incentive to draft him
[4/27/17, 5:20:20 PM] Steve: He's behind Ajayi
[4/27/17, 5:20:24 PM] Steve: Good luck my friend
[4/27/17, 5:20:35 PM] Steve: At the time I thought it was too early
[4/27/17, 5:20:36 PM] Dan Watts: Drizzy > yeldon
[4/27/17, 5:20:40 PM] Miller: handcuffing TEs - still not a thing
[4/27/17, 5:20:42 PM] Steve: But he looks like the real deal
[4/27/17, 5:20:53 PM] Steve: Drake was also too early
[4/27/17, 5:21:03 PM] Steve: But it got me Dixon so I'm cool with it
[4/27/17, 5:21:16 PM] Miller: here comes results based launchpad with my LOOK AT THE RESULTS DID IT WORK OUT? SEE I AM RIGHT YOU ARE WRONG
[4/27/17, 5:22:06 PM] Miller: regardless of who your TE was or was not henry was not a bad pick at the time at that spot
[4/27/17, 5:22:34 PM] Steve: He was a bad pick with scotts team
[4/27/17, 5:22:45 PM] Steve: He had more needs than a handcuff to his tight end
[4/27/17, 5:22:54 PM] Steve: Talent wise, he is worth it
[4/27/17, 5:23:00 PM] Miller: could make easy argument henry was BPA there
[4/27/17, 5:23:04 PM] Miller: and he wasnt competing
[4/27/17, 5:23:08 PM] Miller: so why reach for a "need" pick
[4/27/17, 5:23:15 PM] Steve: But you don't draft a tight end when you need wide receivers and running backs in the first round
[4/27/17, 5:23:27 PM] Steve: He's not reaching
[4/27/17, 5:23:36 PM] Steve: Plenty of good running backs still left on the board
[4/27/17, 5:23:42 PM] Miller: nope
[4/27/17, 5:23:56 PM] Miller: not at the time and not in hindsight
[4/27/17, 5:24:34 PM] Kiyoon: Dixon was still available
[4/27/17, 5:24:44 PM] Miller: and?
[4/27/17, 5:24:54 PM] Steve: Jordan howard
[4/27/17, 5:24:59 PM] Kiyoon: I thought that guy woulda been gone top 8
[4/27/17, 5:25:04 PM] Miller: howard only works in hindsight
[4/27/17, 5:25:05 PM] Kiyoon: howard is more hindsight though
[4/27/17, 5:25:07 PM] Steve: Malcolm Mitchell
[4/27/17, 5:25:14 PM] Kiyoon: lol mitchell definitely hindsight
[4/27/17, 5:25:14 PM] Miller: not better than henry then or now
[4/27/17, 5:25:24 PM] Miller: mitchell not even close to henry in hindsight
[4/27/17, 5:25:27 PM] Steve: Pretty sure your statement above said "not in hindsight"
[4/27/17, 5:25:28 PM] Steve: Forgot
[4/27/17, 5:25:29 PM] Miller: further apart 1yr later
[4/27/17, 5:25:36 PM] Miller: i was wrong about howard forgot about him
[4/27/17, 5:25:39 PM] Steve: I was talking to "what fits my argument" Miller
[4/27/17, 5:25:53 PM] Miller: so there was 1, which only works in hindsight
[4/27/17, 5:25:59 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/27/17, 5:26:01 PM] Steve: I'm done
[4/27/17, 5:26:07 PM] Miller: you are
[4/27/17, 5:26:10 PM] Kiyoon: Miller you also laughed hysterically when LP picked Henry
[4/27/17, 5:26:14 PM] Steve: You already changed the rules
[4/27/17, 5:26:22 PM] Miller: im not changing anything
[4/27/17, 5:26:26 PM] Miller: i said i forgot about howard
[4/27/17, 5:26:28 PM] Miller: i made a mistake
[4/27/17, 5:26:29 PM] Miller: zomg
[4/27/17, 5:26:30 PM] Miller: kill me
[4/27/17, 5:26:32 PM] Steve: Don't need to play a "find me the answer, but I'll change stuff when you find it" game
[4/27/17, 5:26:38 PM] Miller: i said howard fits the bill
[4/27/17, 5:26:41 PM] Steve: Done that too many times
[4/27/17, 5:27:01 PM] Miller: and yes @16313981203 i did laugh b/c his reasoning was (and still is) hilarious
[4/27/17, 5:27:28 PM] Miller: so you said plenty of good RBs and WRs left on the board
[4/27/17, 5:27:33 PM] Miller: there was literally 1
[4/27/17, 5:27:38 PM] Miller: and that 1 is only w/the benefit of hindsight
[4/27/17, 5:28:05 PM] Miller: so yes, you win, you caught me, i mis-spoke but the entire actual premise of the discussion is still valid
[4/27/17, 5:29:02 PM] Launchpad: paul perkins and devontae booker were still available and I got booker
[4/27/17, 5:29:46 PM] Miller: and then refused to trade booker for nuk hopkins
[4/27/17, 5:29:57 PM] Miller: should have quit w/henry while you were ahead
[4/27/17, 5:30:06 PM] Launchpad: you mean diggs, ajayi and a 1st
[4/27/17, 5:30:16 PM] Launchpad: it wasnt booker for hopkins ever
[4/27/17, 5:30:27 PM] Miller: in my mind it was
[4/27/17, 5:30:33 PM] Miller: im too lazy to go back and look at it
[4/27/17, 5:30:40 PM] Miller: im at least 1/2 right
[4/27/17, 5:30:44 PM] Launchpad: pretty sure I still made the right call on that one
[4/27/17, 6:16:53 PM] Miller: should get one for the biggest falcons fan i know @16313981203
[4/27/17, 6:17:17 PM] Miller: god that 2H/OT was amazing
[4/27/17, 6:17:28 PM] Miller: unquestionable üêê after that
[4/27/17, 6:17:45 PM] Miller: the best was the 180 that the internet/memes did in 30 min
[4/27/17, 6:18:29 PM] Miller: i wont even front i thought there was absolutely ZERO chance of it even being a competitive game
[4/27/17, 6:19:02 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah some many anti Brady memes will forever be lost to history. Maybe they end up in a third world country like the Falcons Super Bowl champs shirts
[4/27/17, 6:19:08 PM] Miller: hahahah
[4/27/17, 6:19:28 PM] Miller: poor african kids w/no internet just getting hard printed copies of brady crying jordan memes
[4/27/17, 6:20:00 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/27/17, 6:20:26 PM] Brian Katz: You think Africa has an alternate knowledge of us sports?
[4/27/17, 6:20:47 PM] Miller: still celebrating that patriots 19-0 season
[4/27/17, 6:24:23 PM] Brian Katz: That back to back Seahawks gear
[4/27/17, 6:25:10 PM] Miller: the list of things i would do to avoid prison for 1 year, forget 20 years, is substantial
[4/27/17, 6:25:48 PM] Brian Katz: Lol agreed
[4/27/17, 6:26:56 PM] Brian Katz: If there was a tv show where they offered you crazy things like this, it would be the most watched show on tv
[4/27/17, 6:27:41 PM] Justin: wasnt that a black mirror episode
[4/27/17, 6:27:51 PM] Miller: i mean sure, if there was a show where they had prisoners fight to the death like that stone cold movie it would also be the highest rated show
[4/27/17, 6:27:58 PM] Miller: but both seem like they have logistical issues
[4/27/17, 6:28:11 PM] Miller: i dont think so
[4/27/17, 6:28:12 PM] Brian Katz: Lol true
[4/27/17, 6:28:23 PM] Brian Katz: That was a pug fucking thing Herm
[4/27/17, 6:28:33 PM] Justin: there was some reality show episdoe
[4/27/17, 6:28:54 PM] Miller: 15 million merits?
[4/27/17, 6:29:46 PM] Brian Katz: Credits
[4/27/17, 6:30:13 PM] Brian Katz: That's the guy from get out, btw it was okay, mad overrated
[4/27/17, 6:30:24 PM] Miller: yes
[4/27/17, 6:30:28 PM] Miller: cmon that movie was awesome
[4/27/17, 6:30:43 PM] Miller: one of the best movies ive seen in a long time
[4/27/17, 6:31:18 PM] Miller: its also so weird to me how people with accents can just turn them off when acting
[4/27/17, 6:31:29 PM] Miller: like that guy or idris elba etc.. etc...
[4/27/17, 6:31:31 PM] Miller: mcnutty
[4/27/17, 6:32:05 PM] Sean: Like Dorit!
[4/27/17, 6:32:06 PM] Brian Katz: Only if they're from the U.K.
[4/27/17, 6:33:43 PM] Brian Katz: The end was rushed. It had no intense science where you thought for one second he wasn't going to make it. It was clear that they were taking them over. They didn't even show any gore. It was a cool concept done on a tight budget, that felt rushed.
[4/27/17, 6:33:50 PM] Brian Katz: Scenes*
[4/27/17, 6:34:45 PM] Brian Katz: Also watched moonlight. It almost had no story, and was pretty lame. Was shit beautifully though
[4/27/17, 6:34:57 PM] Brian Katz: Shot*
[4/27/17, 6:35:53 PM] Launchpad: Runing Man
[4/27/17, 6:36:00 PM] Launchpad: Pretty sure I watched it with you
[4/27/17, 6:36:53 PM] Miller: yea same concept
[4/27/17, 6:36:58 PM] Miller: i forget the name of that stone cold movie
[4/27/17, 6:37:01 PM] Miller: was also awesome
[4/27/17, 6:37:06 PM] Miller: not quite running man good
[4/27/17, 6:39:31 PM] Dan Watts: Black card revoked
[4/27/17, 6:40:02 PM] Brian Katz: Why? It was more about gay black people
[4/27/17, 6:40:13 PM] Miller: gay card also revoked
[4/27/17, 6:40:45 PM] Launchpad: poor guy
[4/27/17, 6:40:59 PM] Launchpad: hes now been shunned by the blacks, gays, trannies, and retards
[4/27/17, 6:42:01 PM] Brian Katz: That movie had no beginning, middle, or end. What was the climax? That he reconnected with Kevin and had a nice hug? Yawn
[4/27/17, 7:18:50 PM] Brian Katz: God cheese your offense in the baseball league stinks lol
[4/27/17, 8:22:24 PM] Donk: Wow
[4/27/17, 8:22:37 PM] Miller: Terrible
[4/27/17, 8:23:03 PM] Donk: Didnt see that coming
[4/27/17, 8:23:13 PM] Steve: What happened?
[4/27/17, 8:23:17 PM] Justin: did they need to do that?
[4/27/17, 8:24:37 PM] Donk: Chicago traded up and drafted trubisky
[4/27/17, 8:24:45 PM] Donk: I dont think so, but who knows
[4/27/17, 8:25:16 PM] Steve: Wow
[4/27/17, 8:25:17 PM] Steve: That's a very bold move
[4/27/17, 8:25:18 PM] Steve: Where did they have to trade up to?
[4/27/17, 8:25:19 PM] Steve: What did they give up?
[4/27/17, 8:25:20 PM] Steve: Sorry, I'm on the train
[4/27/17, 8:25:35 PM] Justin: sf does need qb
[4/27/17, 8:25:40 PM] Donk: 3 to 2, 2 thirds and a 4th
[4/27/17, 8:25:58 PM] Steve: That's a lot to move up one spot
[4/27/17, 8:26:59 PM] Steve: But if they think he's the future
[4/27/17, 8:27:02 PM] Steve: It's worth it
[4/27/17, 8:30:27 PM] Brian Katz: San Fran fleeced chi town
[4/27/17, 8:31:20 PM] Justin: that guy wa top qb pick though?
[4/27/17, 8:32:28 PM] Donk: Yeah,  but its not like he is Andrew luck
[4/27/17, 8:32:39 PM] Steve: Pretty sure he was ranked second on most boards
[4/27/17, 8:32:53 PM] Donk: He was consensus 1
[4/27/17, 8:32:56 PM] Steve: The kid out of Clemson was ranked higher, no?
[4/27/17, 8:33:08 PM] Donk: Dont think so
[4/27/17, 8:33:11 PM] Donk: But close
[4/27/17, 8:36:11 PM] Donk: That yeldon value in freefall
[4/27/17, 8:36:24 PM] Steve: Don't know what that means
[4/27/17, 8:36:28 PM] Steve: Still on a train
[4/27/17, 8:36:36 PM] Steve: Also, Yeldon is 23
[4/27/17, 8:36:40 PM] Donk: Jax drafted forunette
[4/27/17, 8:36:46 PM] Steve: I'd be more worried about 28 year old ivory
[4/27/17, 8:36:50 PM] Brian Katz: Nah
[4/27/17, 8:36:52 PM] Steve: Who you also have
[4/27/17, 8:37:07 PM] Brian Katz: Yeldon sux and they just drafted a 3 down stud
[4/27/17, 8:37:08 PM] Steve: You've had a rough offseason
[4/27/17, 8:37:14 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/27/17, 8:37:26 PM] Donk: Damn, steve mad
[4/27/17, 8:37:35 PM] Donk: Sorry guy, it happens
[4/27/17, 8:37:50 PM] Brian Katz: you got woods handcuff
[4/27/17, 8:38:04 PM] Brian Katz: You could get a 4th maybe lol
[4/27/17, 8:38:26 PM] Steve: Katz, the guru who doesn't win, ever.
[4/27/17, 8:38:28 PM] Steve: Not at all
[4/27/17, 8:38:28 PM] Steve: Other than being mad at the MTA
[4/27/17, 8:38:28 PM] Steve: That's a daily occurrence though

[4/27/17, 8:41:24 PM] Steve: Katz bragging about being 4th
[4/27/17, 8:41:32 PM] Donk: 8th actually
[4/27/17, 8:41:46 PM] Brian Katz: I wasn't bragging I was saying I'm not losing
[4/27/17, 8:41:59 PM] Brian Katz: If you ain't first you last though
[4/27/17, 8:42:03 PM] Steve: You haven't even won
[4/27/17, 8:42:09 PM] Brian Katz: I get that
[4/27/17, 8:42:18 PM] Steve: So how are you not losing?
[4/27/17, 8:42:23 PM] Steve: Pretty sure you either win or lose
[4/27/17, 8:42:26 PM] Brian Katz: But if you look at what I'm doing, dynasty son
[4/27/17, 8:42:36 PM] Justin: winners win
[4/27/17, 8:42:54 PM] Steve: Apparently in katz world, winners finish 4th
[4/27/17, 8:43:11 PM] Steve: And call everything "retarded" as a medical term
[4/27/17, 8:43:14 PM] Brian Katz: Corey Davis?

[4/27/17, 8:48:29 PM] Donk: Ha
[4/27/17, 8:49:13 PM] Brian Katz: Unless it's the rb from Fsu lol
[4/27/17, 8:59:19 PM] Brian Katz: That could be sexy
[4/27/17, 8:59:47 PM] Brian Katz: Finally rivers can do herman right lol
[4/27/17, 9:00:12 PM] Brian Katz: I guess they're not banking on Allen ever staying healthy
[4/27/17, 9:03:21 PM] Launchpad: Chargers? Who cares
[4/27/17, 9:04:02 PM] Brian Katz: La

[4/27/17, 9:06:21 PM] Brian Katz: Interesting
[4/27/17, 9:10:26 PM] Brian Katz: This must be the highest drafted White running back, since the inclusion of black people
[4/27/17, 9:11:52 PM] Launchpad: such privilege to be up there
[4/27/17, 9:12:22 PM] Brian Katz: John Ross, guys got mad speed

[4/27/17, 9:46:33 PM] Brian Katz: That's why Arizona stays sucking
[4/27/17, 9:47:10 PM] Kiyoon: Did they not take Hasan Reddick
[4/27/17, 9:47:25 PM] Kiyoon: Or were you just predicting howard
[4/27/17, 9:47:25 PM] Brian Katz: They did
[4/27/17, 9:47:29 PM] Kiyoon: Oh ok
[4/27/17, 9:47:30 PM] Brian Katz: Predicting
[4/27/17, 9:47:48 PM] Brian Katz: They don't really need a olb and have no te
[4/27/17, 9:50:40 PM] Brian Katz: Foster?
[4/27/17, 9:53:09 PM] Brian Katz: Damn
[4/27/17, 9:53:18 PM] Brian Katz: Not a fan
[4/27/17, 9:53:51 PM] Brian Katz: Eagles are lame
[4/27/17, 10:04:52 PM] Tk: This draft sucks already! Wanted Ross or m. Wiliams. At least get Foster (bama)
[4/27/17, 10:05:25 PM] Brian Katz: That's who they should draft
[4/27/17, 10:05:54 PM] Brian Katz: Or Howard
[4/27/17, 10:08:01 PM] Brian Katz: He's nice too
[4/27/17, 10:09:03 PM] Dan Watts: Howard falling in the draft IRL and in fantasy (to me @ 1.13)
[4/27/17, 10:12:47 PM] Brian Katz: Still not falling to you
[4/27/17, 10:17:39 PM] Donk: Tennessee going to take howard
[4/27/17, 10:20:09 PM] Brian Katz: That offense will be nasty
[4/27/17, 10:20:27 PM] Brian Katz: I say db
[4/27/17, 10:20:37 PM] Brian Katz: Or foster
[4/27/17, 10:21:18 PM] Brian Katz: That teams dbs were whack last year
[4/27/17, 10:24:16 PM] Brian Katz: I'd love it if TB drafts cooks.
[4/27/17, 10:24:21 PM] Brian Katz: Cook*
[4/27/17, 10:25:26 PM] Dan Watts: Delanie Walker forever lmao
[4/27/17, 10:27:25 PM] Dan Watts: Fine if he doesn't fall to me that means I'm going to get another bomb player picked before Howard lol
[4/27/17, 10:27:45 PM] Brian Katz: That's a qb
[4/27/17, 10:28:28 PM] Brian Katz: Howard
[4/27/17, 10:29:09 PM] Kiyoon: Fuck
[4/27/17, 10:49:51 PM] Tk: Wow!! That dude over the TE from The U?
[4/27/17, 10:51:06 PM] Tk: I actually dknow about Engram but Njoku from the U will be good.
[4/27/17, 11:12:49 PM] Brian Katz: Agreed
[4/28/17, 7:57:15 AM] Miller: draft recap
[4/28/17, 7:57:35 AM] Miller: 1. lynch killed it, hes already one of the most succesful GMs in the NFL but this just cemented it
[4/28/17, 7:57:57 AM] Miller: 2. LOL @ everyone on twitter killing the cowboys taco pick, apparently this kid sucks
[4/28/17, 7:58:08 AM] Miller: 3. awful moves from all 3 teams trading up for QBs
[4/28/17, 7:58:19 AM] Miller: 4. giants offense going to be so lit this season
[4/28/17, 7:59:28 AM] Scott: So fuckin lit
[4/28/17, 7:59:37 AM] Scott: Now they just gotta sign Blount
[4/28/17, 8:01:53 AM] Miller: The Dallas Cowboys had 18 first-round grades on players entering the 2017 draft, and Taco Charlton was not one of them.
[4/28/17, 8:02:34 AM] Brian Katz: Taco corp
[4/28/17, 8:04:33 AM] Brian Katz: The Giants I think made a huge leap this offseason. We are stacked on offense. We need a eater run game now, hopefully in the draft we pick up some help, and grab Blount.
[4/28/17, 8:04:53 AM] Brian Katz: Better*
[4/28/17, 8:05:09 AM] Miller: OL and LB/DE still need some work
[4/28/17, 8:05:14 AM] Scott: Blount o line depth and another lb
[4/28/17, 8:05:19 AM] Miller: idk how they dont score 30 a game though
[4/28/17, 8:05:33 AM] Scott: Injuries?
[4/28/17, 8:05:37 AM] Scott: Eli confusion?
[4/28/17, 8:05:38 AM] Miller: well yes
[4/28/17, 8:05:42 AM] Scott: Bad o line?
[4/28/17, 8:05:45 AM] Miller: if the team plane crashes on the way to the stadium
[4/28/17, 8:05:51 AM] Scott: Other team spends too much time on the field?
[4/28/17, 8:05:52 AM] Scott: Aliens?
[4/28/17, 8:06:11 AM] Brian Katz: Trumps taking care of that lol
[4/28/17, 8:06:16 AM] Scott: Lol
[4/28/17, 8:38:12 AM] Dan Watts: Just Blount
[4/28/17, 8:38:25 AM] Dan Watts: Word!
[4/28/17, 9:30:27 AM] Kiyoon: geez so much giants dick sucking going on
[4/28/17, 9:32:19 AM] Kiyoon: anyone want to make an over under bet at 9.5 wins?
[4/28/17, 9:34:30 AM] Donk: You do realize that its mostly giants fans here
[4/28/17, 9:34:42 AM] Kiyoon: yes I know
[4/28/17, 9:34:43 AM] Miller: ill make a bet they finish top 10 in points
[4/28/17, 9:34:53 AM] Miller: which was my point
[4/28/17, 9:35:01 AM] Kiyoon: hmm
[4/28/17, 9:35:02 AM] Miller: or yards if you prefer
[4/28/17, 9:36:03 AM] Kiyoon: I'll take that bet
[4/28/17, 9:36:14 AM] Kiyoon: debating on points or yards
[4/28/17, 9:36:14 AM] Miller: which one points or yards
[4/28/17, 9:36:16 AM] Miller: k
[4/28/17, 9:36:19 AM] Miller: what are we betting
[4/28/17, 9:36:52 AM] Kiyoon: $20
[4/28/17, 9:37:06 AM] Miller: k
[4/28/17, 9:38:45 AM] Miller: its on the board lmk when you decide on yds or points
[4/28/17, 9:39:14 AM] Miller: took some cheese $ yest, take your $ today
[4/28/17, 9:39:21 AM] Miller: which is good bc im gonna need it to buy katz hibachi

[4/28/17, 9:40:27 AM] Kiyoon: whats the hibachi bet?

[4/28/17, 9:40:44 AM] Donk: Big series this weekend with the o's
[4/28/17, 9:40:59 AM] Brian Katz: Yanks vs Mets regular season record
[4/28/17, 9:41:21 AM] Kiyoon: don't worry Millz, all gonna turn around with deGrom cause I'm giong to the game and giving them some mojo
[4/28/17, 9:41:29 AM] Miller: 2nd time i lose a bet to katz with massive +EV at the time i made it, which im fine with
[4/28/17, 9:41:30 AM] Miller: it happens

[4/28/17, 9:42:10 AM] Kiyoon: fuckin tickets skyrocketed for today with the damn weather
[4/28/17, 9:42:15 AM] Kiyoon: damn fair weather fans
[4/28/17, 9:42:35 AM] Donk: New gorillaz dropped today if anyone cares

[4/28/17, 9:43:37 AM] Miller: tebro game date will live!
[4/28/17, 9:47:17 AM] Dan Watts: How many üî•?
[4/28/17, 9:47:34 AM] Donk: Just started listening
[4/28/17, 9:47:41 AM] Donk: Dont know how many flames yet
[4/28/17, 9:48:03 AM] Donk: I still cant believe how you guys dont love the new kendrick
[4/28/17, 9:48:18 AM] Donk: Literally the only people i know who dont

[4/28/17, 9:51:26 AM] Miller: rest of it is meh
[4/28/17, 9:51:51 AM] Miller: and there are dozens of us!
[4/28/17, 9:52:03 AM] Brian Katz: If tebow comes up count me in for tebow day millz
[4/28/17, 9:52:24 AM] Miller: yea was already counting you in
[4/28/17, 9:52:31 AM] Miller: gotta rock our matching tebow jerseys
[4/28/17, 9:54:01 AM] Brian Katz: Oh yeah man, I'll be tebowing all day
[4/28/17, 9:54:31 AM] Miller: @17189742074 will as well (but in reality he will be just doing the bushwacker)
[4/28/17, 9:56:03 AM] Brian Katz: Lol that shit was hilarious
[4/28/17, 10:24:00 AM] Miller: @16195657200 http://www.brandeating.com/2017/04/taco-bell-set-to-offer-very-limited-reservations-for-test-kitchen.html
[4/28/17, 10:30:29 AM] Launchpad: Irvine? thats doable
[4/28/17, 10:31:08 AM] Miller: yea i googled it before i proposed the idea
[4/28/17, 10:31:40 AM] Launchpad: right next to anaheim
[4/28/17, 10:37:37 AM] Justin: Remember when everyone said Bernie socialist programs was "unaffordable". 70billion for free college. How dare he. Blah blah blah hedge fund tax.  Trumps tax plan costing 700 billion a year.  Just letting that simmer.
[4/28/17, 10:38:21 AM] Miller: not saying it wont eventually but theres not enough details out for any kind of accurate scoring
[4/28/17, 10:38:45 AM] Miller: plus once they get the (mostly bullshit) dynamic scoring and whatnot involved it will change again
[4/28/17, 10:38:51 AM] Justin: Guessing when you did your math other day you took into account state deduction ?
[4/28/17, 10:39:08 AM] Miller: yes
[4/28/17, 10:39:19 AM] Justin: How exactly does that work always wanted to know.
[4/28/17, 10:39:28 AM] Justin: Is it full deduction on state paid?
[4/28/17, 10:39:51 AM] Miller: currently you deduct the state (and nyc in theory) or any kind of local taxes from the amount you need to then pay for federal
[4/28/17, 10:40:14 AM] Justin: So tax paid comes off total income?
[4/28/17, 10:40:29 AM] Miller: yes
[4/28/17, 10:40:29 AM] Justin: Oh off federal owed.
[4/28/17, 10:41:24 AM] Justin: I mean say make 100 k pay 10 k state owe 30 federal. Are you now paying on 90. You are you deducting that 10 from 30k payment
[4/28/17, 10:41:54 AM] Miller: no you pay the federal rate on the 90k not the 100k
[4/28/17, 10:42:16 AM] Justin: So it's only worth 4-5 %
[4/28/17, 10:42:54 AM] Miller: another interesting point http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/330943-trump-tax-plan-would-hit-blue-states-hardest
[4/28/17, 10:43:08 AM] Miller: Ending state and local tax deductions would have a significant impact on taxpayers who itemize their taxes. More than 45 percent of those earning between $50,000 and $100,000 a year itemized their taxes, according to the IRS and the Tax Foundation. 

More than 80 percent of those earning over $100,000 did so, and the state and local tax deduction cut their adjusted gross income by more than 6.5 percent.
[4/28/17, 10:44:39 AM] Justin: Yeh he's hinting at the chess game
[4/28/17, 10:45:08 AM] Justin: It's really a tax hike supported by kochs and all their tax hating scum.
[4/28/17, 10:45:24 AM] Justin: They realize that this will force states to cut state taxes which is their overall goal.
[4/28/17, 10:45:52 AM] Justin: And at same time their is the immediate benefit of fucking blue states on a political level
[4/28/17, 10:46:14 AM] Justin: There*
[4/28/17, 10:47:29 AM] Justin: Crazy so many people itemize, must be a lot of good shady accountants out there.
[4/28/17, 10:57:58 AM] Launchpad: Maybe people just have a different tax situation than you do?
[4/28/17, 10:58:49 AM] Launchpad: I didn't realize itemizing deductions,  1 of 2 choices, is a shady thing to do
[4/28/17, 11:00:50 AM] Justin: wahhhhhhhhhhhh
[4/28/17, 11:02:26 AM] Launchpad: lol you're rediculous
[4/28/17, 11:02:44 AM] Justin: Please explain?
[4/28/17, 11:03:08 AM] Launchpad: to suggest that eveyone who itemizes is doing something sketchy
[4/28/17, 11:03:28 AM] Justin: Perhaps I underestimated the amount of people that are now contracted employees as opposed to full time workers but "80" percent ?
[4/28/17, 11:03:33 AM] Justin: When did I do that
[4/28/17, 11:03:36 AM] Justin: Let's play lp
[4/28/17, 11:03:57 AM] Justin: When did I say everyone please show me
[4/28/17, 11:04:43 AM] Launchpad: you're right you did not say 'everyone' but you implied that itemizing is sketchy
[4/28/17, 11:04:55 AM] Justin: Did I how you know what I'm implying
[4/28/17, 11:04:57 AM] Dan Watts: My accountant does magic and I get decent returns every year. Does that make me a bad person?
[4/28/17, 11:05:00 AM] Justin: Can you read my mind?
[4/28/17, 11:05:33 AM] Justin: Wasn't making a moral argument watts. Just saying accountants gotta be doing magic, nothing wrong with it as far as I'm concerned
[4/28/17, 11:05:49 AM] Dan Watts: üòá
[4/28/17, 11:05:54 AM] Justin: But back to lp. Today you will get to argue against lp logo
[4/28/17, 11:05:57 AM] Justin: Logic*
[4/28/17, 11:06:10 AM] Justin: Can you read my mind? How do you know what I'm implying?
[4/28/17, 11:06:31 AM] Launchpad: No I don't argue your words, I want you to clarify your intentions
[4/28/17, 11:06:56 AM] Justin: Well you mischaracterized my words already
[4/28/17, 11:07:00 AM] Justin: So that's not true
[4/28/17, 11:08:00 AM] Launchpad: Its more important that if we're going to argue that you clearly state your position. Im not interested in arguing the exact words you used and accuse you of flipflopping like some people here.
[4/28/17, 11:08:09 AM] Launchpad: so if I mischaracterized your words, I apoligize
[4/28/17, 11:08:25 AM] Launchpad: you see the difference?
[4/28/17, 11:08:34 AM] Dan Watts: Heading to @16102201963 office right now. The first cheese wizz callabo may be in the works
[4/28/17, 11:08:45 AM] Dan Watts: All summer 17
[4/28/17, 11:08:55 AM] Miller: doesnt even come bye and say hi
[4/28/17, 11:08:58 AM] Miller: i see how it is
[4/28/17, 11:09:07 AM] Justin: Well my words interpreted in real life, as pointed out by watts and I'd assume most people who see here deductions is that there are a lot of good accountants blurring the lines on what is deductible
[4/28/17, 11:10:09 AM] Justin: Also must be A lot of employment is contracted now which allows for greater leeway w deductions
[4/28/17, 11:10:12 AM] Scott: #summer17 #cheese2.0
[4/28/17, 11:11:27 AM] Justin: Rewind. I think it makes more sense now. It's only 45% for 50-100k.
[4/28/17, 11:11:41 AM] Miller: oh shit hes reading the actual text now
[4/28/17, 11:11:42 AM] Justin: Which given percent of contracted employees makes sense.
[4/28/17, 11:13:38 AM] Launchpad: lol
[4/28/17, 11:14:39 AM] Justin: Irrelevant considering you took no concern over that. See if you thought like miller you be able to make an ass of me a lot easier
[4/28/17, 11:15:30 AM] Launchpad: You do not need any help making yourself look like an ass
[4/28/17, 11:16:23 AM] Justin: And then he resorts to personal insults
[4/28/17, 11:16:55 AM] Justin: So you mischaracterize my statement, resort to personal insults- that's your white privilege
[4/28/17, 11:17:18 AM] Launchpad: üëè
[4/28/17, 11:17:27 AM] Launchpad: Herman can troll too
[4/28/17, 11:45:27 AM] Miller: lol holy shit
[4/28/17, 11:45:48 AM] Miller: ja rule (sort of, a company he is affiliated with) threw this fyre festival

[4/28/17, 11:46:34 AM] Miller: or if you want the less funny more concise version http://nypost.com/2017/04/28/ja-rules-luxury-island-paradise-descends-into-hell/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPTwitter&utm_medium=SocialFlow&sr_share=twitter

[4/28/17, 11:49:57 AM] Dan Watts: @15166335046 just reading about this now. Crazy!
[4/28/17, 11:50:38 AM] Miller: http://www.businessinsider.com/we-spoke-to-someone-with-no-food-or-water-at-the-chaotic-fyre-festival-2017-4

[4/28/17, 12:00:38 PM] Dan Watts: This is so nuts
[4/28/17, 12:00:56 PM] Dan Watts: I can't tell if this was really poorly run and they're trying to spin it or this was totally intentional
[4/28/17, 12:01:07 PM] Miller: 100% the former
[4/28/17, 12:01:09 PM] Dan Watts: Sounds like a case for cheese wizz
[4/28/17, 12:01:18 PM] Miller: oh theres gonna be lawsuits
[4/28/17, 12:01:27 PM] Miller: i wish @16195657200 had gone, would have been so good
[4/28/17, 12:01:34 PM] Scott: #cheezewizz$$$
[4/28/17, 12:04:21 PM] Launchpad: I don't go to festivals run by that idiot Ja Rule, I go to Bangers run by Pasquale Rotella
[4/28/17, 12:05:56 PM] Miller: i still think 1/2 those names in that lineup flyer are fake
[4/28/17, 12:06:38 PM] Dan Watts: Thugfucker is real
[4/28/17, 12:06:52 PM] Launchpad: those are Dan's guys on there
[4/28/17, 12:06:55 PM] Launchpad: Lee Burridge
[4/28/17, 12:11:47 PM] Dan Watts: Lol yup
[4/28/17, 12:12:34 PM] Launchpad: I once bought tickets to a festival that got cancelled and I never got a refund
[4/28/17, 12:12:56 PM] Launchpad: actually @17189742074 you were going to come with me it was Halloween
[4/28/17, 12:13:03 PM] Launchpad: Armin only show
[4/28/17, 12:13:09 PM] Brian Katz: Steve you out on baseball?
[4/28/17, 12:13:09 PM] Kiyoon: oh damnnnn
[4/28/17, 12:13:39 PM] Brian Katz: You told justin to tell me, that's a real bitch move steve
[4/28/17, 12:14:23 PM] Steve: Didn't tell Justin to tell you anything
[4/28/17, 12:14:30 PM] Steve: Just told Justin I was out
[4/28/17, 12:15:39 PM] Brian Katz: That's a real bitch move steve
[4/28/17, 12:15:48 PM] Steve: Ok
[4/28/17, 12:16:02 PM] Brian Katz: You could just say hey I have to go do something else I'm out lol
[4/28/17, 12:16:20 PM] Steve: I'll consider that for next time
[4/28/17, 12:16:37 PM] Brian Katz: It's all good
[4/28/17, 12:17:08 PM] Brian Katz: Sean, can you still get that court? Would love to get some bball in
[4/28/17, 12:18:49 PM] Miller: now youre talking my language
[4/28/17, 12:19:04 PM] Launchpad: Bitcoin at a new ATH: $1311
[4/28/17, 12:20:35 PM] Brian Katz: How many bits though
[4/28/17, 12:20:56 PM] Scott: bits/coin
[4/28/17, 12:23:43 PM] Launchpad: That would mean that a single bitcoin would be divided into 1,000,000 individual units ‚Äì or 'bits'. So, one bit would be worth 0.000001 BTC, which at recent prices would roughly amount to $.0004. One hundred bits would be $.04.Apr 25, 2014
[4/28/17, 12:24:06 PM] Launchpad: 1 million
[4/28/17, 12:24:13 PM] Brian Katz: Damn! That's a lotta bits
[4/28/17, 12:33:13 PM] Justin: How many coins?
[4/28/17, 12:33:58 PM] Launchpad: cmon don't be asking rediculous questions
[4/28/17, 12:35:02 PM] Justin: I think katz is shocked his question has a real answer
[4/28/17, 12:35:44 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/28/17, 12:36:15 PM] Brian Katz: A little TBH
[4/28/17, 12:38:51 PM] Justin: damn bears trade up and get c- rating
[4/28/17, 12:40:10 PM] Brian Katz: They traded up for trubisky a guy who people weren't even sure if he'd go too ten
[4/28/17, 12:40:32 PM] Miller: jets would have taken him at 6
[4/28/17, 12:40:47 PM] Miller: (still not saying they should have done it)
[4/28/17, 12:41:50 PM] Justin: so chances this guys career  Ryan Ramczyk amounts to something more than cooks?
[4/28/17, 12:41:55 PM] Brian Katz: It wasn't like he was a clear franchise qb, no scouts were incredibly high on him
[4/28/17, 12:42:18 PM] Brian Katz: He could be a really good tackle
[4/28/17, 12:42:26 PM] Brian Katz: But is that all they got?
[4/28/17, 12:42:32 PM] Justin: think so right
[4/28/17, 12:42:34 PM] Justin: maybe a 6th
[4/28/17, 12:42:39 PM] Miller: who is ryan ramcyzx?
[4/28/17, 12:42:58 PM] Brian Katz: I like the 9ers foster move. He's a top ten talent they got at 31
[4/28/17, 12:43:05 PM] Brian Katz: Wisconsin tackle
[4/28/17, 12:43:07 PM] Justin: will be exactly what people say 5 years from now when cooks is next randy moss
[4/28/17, 12:43:07 PM] Miller: 49ers killed it
[4/28/17, 12:43:20 PM] Miller: lol ill take the under on that
[4/28/17, 12:43:26 PM] Brian Katz: No way
[4/28/17, 12:43:37 PM] Justin: yeh gues sisnt many years left for brady
[4/28/17, 12:43:40 PM] Brian Katz: Cooks will be about the same he was on the saints
[4/28/17, 12:44:01 PM] Miller: 5'10 185 vs 6'4 215
[4/28/17, 12:44:01 PM] Brian Katz: Isn't like the saints were slouches on offense
[4/28/17, 12:44:05 PM] Miller: yea same thing
[4/28/17, 12:44:21 PM] Justin: i mean he fnished last two seasons with 1200 yds
[4/28/17, 12:44:31 PM] Justin: not exactly a bad thing to stay at that level
[4/28/17, 12:44:40 PM] Brian Katz: No it isn't
[4/28/17, 12:44:47 PM] Miller: but thats also not what you said
[4/28/17, 12:45:02 PM] Justin: i know well thats staying at that level
[4/28/17, 12:45:13 PM] Brian Katz: But the saints figured as long as Bree's is there it don't matter who's at wr
[4/28/17, 12:45:15 PM] Justin: if he takes a step up hes at top of elite level
[4/28/17, 12:45:24 PM] Justin: hes 23
[4/28/17, 12:45:35 PM] Miller: ill wager he has a worse statistical season this yr vs last
[4/28/17, 12:45:40 PM] Miller: if you want to take that
[4/28/17, 12:45:55 PM] Brian Katz: I'm with miller
[4/28/17, 12:46:04 PM] Brian Katz: Pats spread the ball too much
[4/28/17, 12:46:15 PM] Miller: and dont throw it as much
[4/28/17, 12:46:37 PM] Justin: well take it form another interesting perspective
[4/28/17, 12:46:59 PM] Justin: does he have  abetter season then any of the other wr drafted with top 20 picks
[4/28/17, 12:47:03 PM] Launchpad: Gilislee gonna be eating up all the yards
[4/28/17, 12:47:24 PM] Miller: sure
[4/28/17, 12:47:31 PM] Justin: presumably hes a favorite against the field
[4/28/17, 12:47:32 PM] Miller: but the saints didnt trade him and draft a WR
[4/28/17, 12:47:40 PM] Miller: and there were obviously other reasons the saints traded him
[4/28/17, 12:47:51 PM] Miller: you are over simplifying it
[4/28/17, 12:48:05 PM] Brian Katz: We talking a bet here?
[4/28/17, 12:48:19 PM] Miller: na hes gone from cooks is gonna be moss
[4/28/17, 12:48:23 PM] Miller: to well okay cooks is gonna take a step up
[4/28/17, 12:48:30 PM] Miller: to okay well cooks is maybe gonna stay the same
[4/28/17, 12:48:37 PM] Miller: to well cooks is gonna be better than corey davis and mike williams
[4/28/17, 12:48:54 PM] Justin: well the big reason presumably is you get 5 years of a draft pick and only 2 years of cooks
[4/28/17, 12:49:04 PM] Justin: draft pick is cheaper and allows you to address needs
[4/28/17, 12:49:43 PM] Miller: they also got 1/3 not 1/6
[4/28/17, 12:50:50 PM] Brian Katz: The pats know that Brady doesn't have a ton of years left. They are trying to win now every year until he retires
[4/28/17, 12:50:58 PM] Justin: im saying randy moss career was reignited by Tom brady, brady hasn't had a weapon at wr in years
[4/28/17, 12:51:27 PM] Justin: his ceiling is sky high
[4/28/17, 12:51:34 PM] Miller: and yet
[4/28/17, 12:51:38 PM] Miller: here i am w/no bet
[4/28/17, 12:51:40 PM] Justin: ill agree though that he floor is probably lower
[4/28/17, 12:51:54 PM] Justin: and btw saints spread the abll around as much as any team in the league
[4/28/17, 12:52:05 PM] Justin: if not the most( im just assuming this)
[4/28/17, 12:52:21 PM] Miller: to the WRs yes, but they dont throw to the TE nearly as much
[4/28/17, 12:52:27 PM] Justin: they used to
[4/28/17, 12:52:30 PM] Justin: and they have the rb
[4/28/17, 12:52:30 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah but cooks and Thomas get fed
[4/28/17, 12:52:38 PM] Miller: they used to
[4/28/17, 12:52:41 PM] Justin: ran alot of offense through rb
[4/28/17, 12:52:43 PM] Miller: thats great
[4/28/17, 12:52:50 PM] Miller: if graham and cooks played together that would be relevant
[4/28/17, 12:52:59 PM] Brian Katz: Ingram was okay
[4/28/17, 12:53:16 PM] Brian Katz: Now he's garbage! Wish you had that second pick Donk? Lol
[4/28/17, 12:53:43 PM] Brian Katz: McCaffery all day over here
[4/28/17, 12:54:34 PM] Miller: so going from HOF QB to HOF QB on a team that throws the ball less with more competition is somehow a massive positive?
[4/28/17, 12:54:50 PM] Brian Katz: How is Baltimore leading the league in passing? I guess a million check downs to fbs, and Tes is how that happens
[4/28/17, 12:55:03 PM] Miller: yes
[4/28/17, 12:55:06 PM] Miller: wackest offense in the NFL
[4/28/17, 12:55:12 PM] Miller: 2 fb 2 te sets all day
[4/28/17, 12:55:14 PM] Brian Katz: Fo sure
[4/28/17, 12:55:48 PM] Miller: amazing BAL led the lg in passing attempts and flacco and all the WRs there were useless for fantasy
[4/28/17, 12:55:56 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/28/17, 12:56:02 PM] Brian Katz: Unstartable
[4/28/17, 12:56:17 PM] Justin: Rob Gronkowski: 19.2% target share|120 targets|72 catches|1,176 yards|11 TDs
Julian Edelman: 14.1% target share|88 targets|61 catches|692 yards|7 TDs
Danny Amendola: 13.9% target share|87 targets|65 catches|648 yards|3 TDs
Brandon LaFell: 11.9% target share|74 targets|37 catches|515 yards|0 TDs
James White: 8.7% target share|54 targets|40 catches|410 yards|4 TDs
[4/28/17, 12:56:25 PM] Justin: Brandin Cooks: 19.5% target share|129 targets|84 catches|1,128 yards|9 TDs
Ben Watson: 16.6% target share|110 targets|74 catches|825 yards|6 TDs
Willie Snead: 15.2% target share|101 targets|69 catches|984 yards|3 TDs
Marques Colston: 10.1% target share|67 targets|45 catches|520 yards|4 TDs
Mark Ingram: 9% target share|60 targets|50 catches|405 yards|0 TDs
[4/28/17, 12:56:32 PM] Justin: so they still thorw to tight end fyi
[4/28/17, 12:56:49 PM] Justin: think that was 2015 but not exactly ancient history
[4/28/17, 12:57:34 PM] Miller: so you think better chance cooks takes targets from gronk than from i cant even remember his name the TE on NO?
[4/28/17, 12:57:42 PM] Miller: i wanna say cody?
[4/28/17, 12:57:46 PM] Miller: coby
[4/28/17, 12:57:47 PM] Miller: fleener
[4/28/17, 12:57:56 PM] Brian Katz: Yup
[4/28/17, 12:58:02 PM] Brian Katz: Where's the bet herman
[4/28/17, 12:58:04 PM] Miller: not to mention cooks plays almost the exact position as edelman
[4/28/17, 12:58:13 PM] Miller: whereas thomas was complete opposite stylistically
[4/28/17, 12:59:13 PM] Justin: once again i think has higher cieling lower floor, so betting on last years stats kinda stupid
[4/28/17, 12:59:28 PM] Justin: rather bet on higher number with odds
[4/28/17, 12:59:30 PM] Miller: explain why you think he has a higher ceiling
[4/28/17, 12:59:39 PM] Miller: w/o using the words randy or moss
[4/28/17, 1:00:01 PM] Justin: because he either emerges as a masisve weapon for brady, or serves as a agiant distraction to keep defenses in check
[4/28/17, 1:00:51 PM] Justin: essentially julio jones for half the season
[4/28/17, 1:00:51 PM] Miller: corey davis is going to be a mssive weapon for TEN
[4/28/17, 1:00:59 PM] Miller: does what i just said tell you anything?
[4/28/17, 1:01:16 PM] Miller: hyperbole and subjective statement
[4/28/17, 1:01:42 PM] Miller: you should be able to at least lay out a path to why you think he has a chance to improve his stats
[4/28/17, 1:01:57 PM] Miller: its not hard, are his targets going up? if so why? is his efficiency improving? if so why?
[4/28/17, 1:02:32 PM] Miller: otherwise might as well just say mccaffery is the next mike alstott
[4/28/17, 1:02:33 PM] Justin: fine...either they design palys specifically to get cooks the ball in which case he will have rediculous numbers(I.E. Gronk) or they fit him in as a deep threat to keep defenses in check
[4/28/17, 1:02:46 PM] Justin: s that more specific?
[4/28/17, 1:02:57 PM] Miller: implies NO did not do that
[4/28/17, 1:03:10 PM] Miller: he led the team that led the league in passing in targets
[4/28/17, 1:03:12 PM] Miller: for 2 years
[4/28/17, 1:03:36 PM] Miller: is edelmans role changing?
[4/28/17, 1:03:44 PM] Miller: where are his targets coming from? mitchell? chris hogan?
[4/28/17, 1:03:46 PM] Miller: both?
[4/28/17, 1:03:56 PM] Miller: what is cooks skill set?
[4/28/17, 1:04:05 PM] Miller: how is brady deep ball accuracy vs brees?
[4/28/17, 1:05:04 PM] Justin: im gonna elave it at this.  New england designs systems for their players, they revolutionize schemes.  Will they think of a way to make a system around gronk/cooks, if so than former projections dont matter
[4/28/17, 1:05:28 PM] Justin: because distribution will be completely different
[4/28/17, 1:06:12 PM] Miller: still a numbers game
[4/28/17, 1:06:21 PM] Miller: targets x efficiency = stats = fantasy points
[4/28/17, 1:06:24 PM] Justin: not if it changes the numbers drmaitcally
[4/28/17, 1:06:32 PM] Justin: so you are looking at a team that is 14th in passing
[4/28/17, 1:06:37 PM] Justin: new system could have them 2nd
[4/28/17, 1:06:45 PM] Justin: which is perhaps why they let blount walk
[4/28/17, 1:06:50 PM] Miller: so sure maybe NE passes more
[4/28/17, 1:06:50 PM] Dan Watts: He's breaking out this year
[4/28/17, 1:06:57 PM] Miller: or maybe they just spent more $ on RBs then they have in the past 5 years
[4/28/17, 1:07:03 PM] Miller: and signed another top CB improving their defense
[4/28/17, 1:07:07 PM] Miller: so maybe they pass less
[4/28/17, 1:07:29 PM] Justin: fair
[4/28/17, 1:07:36 PM] Justin: so like i said...higher ceiling lower floor
[4/28/17, 1:07:43 PM] Miller: same ceiling lower floor
[4/28/17, 1:08:25 PM] Launchpad: Im taking Mcaffery
[4/28/17, 1:08:34 PM] Miller: doubtful
[4/28/17, 1:08:44 PM] Miller: you will have to take the 2nd best white guy
[4/28/17, 1:08:55 PM] Donk: Yeah mccaffery way gone by 5
[4/28/17, 1:09:29 PM] Launchpad: I think he was the 5th WR/RB picked in the actual draft
[4/28/17, 1:09:40 PM] Brian Katz: Randy Moss
[4/28/17, 1:10:12 PM] Donk: Still wont be there 5 though
[4/28/17, 1:10:32 PM] Brian Katz: I'm taking him if woods picks fourrnette
[4/28/17, 1:10:45 PM] Miller: unless launchpad trades up to take trbuisky
[4/28/17, 1:10:53 PM] Scott: Lp
[4/28/17, 1:11:00 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/28/17, 1:11:09 PM] Scott: Lp will draft Watson trubisky and mahomes
[4/28/17, 1:11:23 PM] Scott: All qb roster throwback
[4/28/17, 1:11:36 PM] Miller: YOU HAVE MORE QBS THA N ME
[4/28/17, 1:11:56 PM] Launchpad: I'm willing to bet I've probably had the fewest # of total QBs on my team during entire dynasty at 4
[4/28/17, 1:12:07 PM] Launchpad: thats counting famous jameis
[4/28/17, 1:12:23 PM] Brian Katz: Yea my option has changed
[4/28/17, 1:12:33 PM] Brian Katz: Opinion*
[4/28/17, 1:13:07 PM] Brian Katz: I can't draft a guy who was drafted a round after mcaffery
[4/28/17, 1:13:24 PM] Miller: no the pick there is either CMC or davis
[4/28/17, 1:14:05 PM] Donk: Katz hates anything but wr3's
[4/28/17, 1:14:08 PM] Miller: IMO, in theory if someone loved williams or mixon or cook lands in a great spot in rd 2 i guess you could make the case for them
[4/28/17, 1:14:38 PM] Miller: donk trying reverse reverse reverse psychology to get katz to take davis
[4/28/17, 1:14:49 PM] Donk: Wr3's for days
[4/28/17, 1:15:52 PM] Launchpad: 5 WR/RB picked in the first 9, no one else in the first round
[4/28/17, 1:16:15 PM] Launchpad: You snakes want my #5 pick you know who you are
[4/28/17, 1:18:37 PM] Miller: snake? i offered you a more than fair deal
[4/28/17, 1:18:49 PM] Miller: doesnt change the fact you are not getting mccaffery
[4/28/17, 1:19:39 PM] Donk: Nor does it mean that that all 5 of those guys should go with the top 5 picks of our draft
[4/28/17, 1:20:09 PM] Miller: no i disagree, it does mean that and everyone should follow that roadmap
[4/28/17, 1:20:15 PM] Donk: Haha
[4/28/17, 1:21:43 PM] Brian Katz: The first five picks should probably be 
Fournette
Mcaffery
Davis
Williams 
Ross
[4/28/17, 1:22:07 PM] Launchpad: no its just funny when Donk, who's spend months following this, is trying to convince me to not wait for the NFL draft to trade my pick
[4/28/17, 1:22:29 PM] Donk: Ive offered you good deals
[4/28/17, 1:22:45 PM] Donk: Waiting for the draft didnt really change anything imo
[4/28/17, 1:22:53 PM] Miller: i dont see the relevance b/w not getting mccaffery and donk trying to trade for your pick?
[4/28/17, 1:23:03 PM] Brian Katz: Donk wants two WRs? And Donk I have WR3's yes whatever, but you don't have RB3's lol
[4/28/17, 1:23:04 PM] Launchpad: i was joking about mccaffery
[4/28/17, 1:23:16 PM] Donk: Except now ypu actually know some of these guys names
[4/28/17, 1:23:23 PM] Launchpad: exactly
[4/28/17, 1:23:37 PM] Launchpad: and I see how NFL teams value them, not just some sportswriter
[4/28/17, 1:23:54 PM] Donk: Ok, well, now you know
[4/28/17, 1:24:00 PM] Launchpad: and I get to see what team the guy goes too
[4/28/17, 1:24:16 PM] Launchpad: big difference as a WR being drafted by CLE vs NO
[4/28/17, 1:24:38 PM] Donk: Sure, but you understand that it.goes both ways
[4/28/17, 1:25:08 PM] Donk: Waiting for the draft can both hurt and help the value of the pick
[4/28/17, 1:25:16 PM] Brian Katz: Nah
[4/28/17, 1:25:30 PM] Launchpad: waiting helps the guy with less information
[4/28/17, 1:25:35 PM] Launchpad: aquire more information
[4/28/17, 1:25:39 PM] Donk: Imo, the draft actually hurt the value of 5
[4/28/17, 1:25:47 PM] Miller: i would agree
[4/28/17, 1:25:52 PM] Brian Katz: Why?
[4/28/17, 1:25:57 PM] Donk: Landing spot
[4/28/17, 1:26:00 PM] Miller: no cook in rd 1
[4/28/17, 1:26:30 PM] Launchpad: right now I would be happy with any of those guys
[4/28/17, 1:26:33 PM] Miller: i think cook on TB or something would have been a stronger top 5 than ross on CIN
[4/28/17, 1:26:35 PM] Brian Katz: He's getting Ross
[4/28/17, 1:26:50 PM] Brian Katz: Or if draft Howard and take the upside
[4/28/17, 1:26:57 PM] Miller: he has henry
[4/28/17, 1:27:06 PM] Brian Katz: So you can play two tes
[4/28/17, 1:27:17 PM] Brian Katz: Draft best available
[4/28/17, 1:28:19 PM] Miller: if TE was clear BPA there i would agree but i dont think he is
[4/28/17, 1:28:25 PM] Brian Katz: You think Ross will be better than Howard then draft Ross, if not draft Howard. Don't pigeon hole yourself because you've filled a position. You can always move a guy
[4/28/17, 1:28:26 PM] Miller: certainly debatable
[4/28/17, 1:28:51 PM] Miller: if i have 2 guys close im going w/the position i need more
[4/28/17, 1:28:56 PM] Launchpad: unlikely I take a TE but you never know
[4/28/17, 1:29:07 PM] Launchpad: maybe I do trade
[4/28/17, 1:29:23 PM] Brian Katz: Agreed miller, but if I don't think they're that close I'll double up at te
[4/28/17, 1:29:34 PM] Brian Katz: You probably should
[4/28/17, 1:29:36 PM] Miller: you just said ross was 5
[4/28/17, 1:29:45 PM] Miller: now you think its so not close that howard is 5
[4/28/17, 1:30:00 PM] Brian Katz: I'm just speculating
[4/28/17, 1:30:30 PM] Launchpad: If I didn't take Henry Howard would be more appealing
[4/28/17, 1:30:43 PM] Launchpad: but I still have Gates and Bennet
[4/28/17, 1:30:43 PM] Brian Katz: Why? You could play them both
[4/28/17, 1:31:07 PM] Brian Katz: Okay yeah don't draft Howard lol
[4/28/17, 1:33:10 PM] Justin: yeh counting on gates at this point near suicidal
[4/28/17, 1:33:29 PM] Miller: hes his 3rd TE
[4/28/17, 1:33:35 PM] Miller: i dont think hes counting on him
[4/28/17, 1:34:42 PM] Launchpad: I need a WR with a high floor
[4/28/17, 1:34:46 PM] Justin: yeah drafting a tight end be pretty dumb at this point
[4/28/17, 1:34:46 PM] Brian Katz: He's a handcuff
[4/28/17, 1:35:05 PM] Justin: trade value will never meet what you pay for him
[4/28/17, 1:35:52 PM] Miller: not sure john ross fits the bill of WR w/high floor
[4/28/17, 1:35:56 PM] Justin: although could argue there is a need now from all shitty tight ends
[4/28/17, 1:36:03 PM] Miller: could double up on your djax approach
[4/28/17, 1:36:03 PM] Donk: Def not for ross
[4/28/17, 1:36:12 PM] Donk: Going to be boom or bust for sure
[4/28/17, 1:39:30 PM] Launchpad: hes in a good situation with AJ taking the double teams
[4/28/17, 1:39:37 PM] Launchpad: Sterling shepard type situation
[4/28/17, 1:39:55 PM] Launchpad: djax in Tampa is interesting
[4/28/17, 1:40:07 PM] Launchpad: yeah I have too many boom / bust WR and too many of them are busting
[4/28/17, 1:40:18 PM] Launchpad: Lockett & Diggs need to stay healthy
[4/28/17, 1:40:25 PM] Launchpad: Devante Parker
[4/28/17, 1:40:40 PM] Launchpad: Parker was also a #5
[4/28/17, 1:41:52 PM] Brian Katz: It's all about treadwell this year, boo Diggy's
[4/28/17, 1:41:56 PM] Brian Katz: Diggs*
[4/28/17, 1:42:17 PM] Miller: boo diggy!
[4/28/17, 1:42:34 PM] Brian Katz: Lol yeah fuck that guy
[4/28/17, 1:43:28 PM] Launchpad: I like the way you work it
[4/28/17, 1:45:34 PM] Justin: docston hype train
[4/28/17, 2:05:24 PM] Launchpad: lol did ja actually say what he said or was it photoshopped
[4/28/17, 2:06:23 PM] Dan Watts: it was a repost from my boys thugfucker so i would think it was legit
[4/28/17, 2:06:45 PM] Kiyoon: Aka no one is getting their money back
[4/28/17, 2:09:24 PM] Miller: that ja thing was 100% fake cmon
[4/28/17, 2:09:39 PM] Miller: they will refund people
[4/28/17, 2:11:35 PM] Launchpad: Pasquale would never let this happen
[4/28/17, 2:12:42 PM] Dan Watts: the thing is fyre was so unbelievablty bad it looks like they didn't even try
[4/28/17, 2:13:10 PM] Launchpad: yeah pretty rediculous
[4/28/17, 2:13:23 PM] Dan Watts: like that cheese sandwich? come on
[4/28/17, 2:13:41 PM] Launchpad: to be fair that was on the vegetarian menu
[4/28/17, 2:13:47 PM] Dan Watts: lol
[4/28/17, 2:14:48 PM] Launchpad: if you order the pork sandwich you have to butcher the pig yourself
[4/28/17, 2:17:39 PM] Brian Katz: Round 2 Donk this weekend, yanks going to beat up on those dumb birds
[4/28/17, 2:21:02 PM] Donk: First place o's, put some respek on it
[4/28/17, 2:21:18 PM] Donk: Amazingly we have not lost a series yet this season
[4/28/17, 2:21:32 PM] Brian Katz: Until this weekend bro
[4/28/17, 2:21:33 PM] Launchpad: The O's are in first place in April?? Never seen that before
[4/28/17, 2:22:16 PM] Donk: Launchpad, its not 2005 anymore
[4/28/17, 2:22:34 PM] Donk: Weve made the playoffs 3 out of the last 4 years
[4/28/17, 2:22:35 PM] Brian Katz: Well it's may 1st in Monday, yanks down one game in the standings. What a good way to start May off in first place
[4/28/17, 2:22:51 PM] Brian Katz: Who eliminated you two years ago
[4/28/17, 2:23:08 PM] Brian Katz: The yanks
[4/28/17, 2:23:18 PM] Donk: That was 4 years ago
[4/28/17, 2:23:24 PM] Donk: Kc
[4/28/17, 2:27:40 PM] Brian Katz: Whatever you know what I was talking bout
[4/28/17, 2:41:14 PM] Miller: old news
[4/28/17, 2:41:30 PM] Launchpad: There's a 10 day DL üòÇüòÇ
[4/28/17, 2:41:41 PM] Launchpad: I'm so out of the loop
[4/28/17, 2:41:49 PM] Miller: theres also a 7 day dl
[4/28/17, 2:41:52 PM] Miller: but only for concussions
[4/28/17, 2:43:26 PM] Brian Katz: How old is the news? Blame bleacher report then lol
[4/28/17, 2:44:15 PM] Miller: i mean sure might just be OFFICIAL rigiht now but he left the game yesterday unable to walk
[4/28/17, 2:44:17 PM] Miller: hes out for a while
[4/28/17, 2:47:14 PM] Brian Katz: Damn Miller cold blooded, wrote off yeonis already
[4/28/17, 2:54:01 PM] Launchpad: Was his body inhabited by a Travelor?
[4/28/17, 3:14:59 PM] Launchpad: @15166335046 was right https://www.quora.com/How-unattractive-is-balding-to-women/answer/Stefan-Pociask
[4/28/17, 3:27:51 PM] Dan Watts: what a fucked up chick
[4/28/17, 3:29:58 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/28/17, 3:51:41 PM] Launchpad: Holy shit, why haven't I thought of this life hack:
"Lend some money to the guy whom you want to avoid. Once the money is given, he will automatically vanish."
[4/28/17, 3:52:01 PM] Miller: rookie
[4/28/17, 3:52:06 PM] Miller: i did that w/martin like 10yrs ago
[4/28/17, 3:53:01 PM] Launchpad: me too but not intentionally
[4/28/17, 3:53:20 PM] Miller: lol cmon also w/martin?!
[4/28/17, 3:53:29 PM] Miller: what kind of scam is this kid running
[4/28/17, 3:53:30 PM] Launchpad: yeah
[4/28/17, 3:53:43 PM] Launchpad: not paying the utility bill scam
[4/28/17, 3:53:45 PM] Miller: probably relaxing on a pvt island by now
[4/28/17, 3:53:56 PM] Launchpad: Cheesecake Island
[4/28/17, 3:54:44 PM] Miller: cake cake cake cake cake
[4/28/17, 3:59:46 PM] Miller: have you seen the video?
[4/28/17, 3:59:51 PM] Miller: he fucking nails that kid
[4/28/17, 3:59:57 PM] Launchpad: nope
[4/28/17, 4:00:28 PM] Donk: Is that him nailing a wheel chair kid?
[4/28/17, 4:01:04 PM] Donk: Also, since hibachi is mentioned every day, he is one of the heirs to the bennihanna fortune
[4/28/17, 4:01:08 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uQEqXpA2N0
[4/28/17, 4:01:48 PM] Launchpad: lol thats pretty funny
[4/28/17, 4:02:08 PM] Kiyoon: thats just impressive
[4/28/17, 4:02:38 PM] Launchpad: suprised he doesn't have a catapult on stage
[4/28/17, 4:02:47 PM] Launchpad: launching cake like tshirts at a baseball game
[4/28/17, 4:03:21 PM] Dan Watts: lmao that was pretty awesome
[4/28/17, 4:03:38 PM] Dan Watts: pretty good internet day today
[4/28/17, 4:03:49 PM] Miller: its actually absurdly impressive
[4/28/17, 4:03:52 PM] Donk: Pretty old internet
[4/28/17, 4:03:53 PM] Miller: he threw that cake like 60ft
[4/28/17, 4:04:04 PM] Miller: hit him cake side up and fucking drilled him
[4/28/17, 4:04:27 PM] Brian Katz: I saw him in AC at yhe borgata, he crushed this chick with a cake. She was so happy about it lol
[4/28/17, 4:04:34 PM] Dan Watts: he's the son of rocky aoki who founded benihanna
[4/28/17, 4:04:36 PM] Miller: .........was she fat?
[4/28/17, 4:04:40 PM] Dan Watts: also of wolf of wall street fame
[4/28/17, 4:04:40 PM] Brian Katz: No
[4/28/17, 4:04:46 PM] Miller: i had to ask
[4/28/17, 4:04:49 PM] Brian Katz: On drugs or drunk
[4/28/17, 4:04:59 PM] Brian Katz: Probably both
[4/28/17, 4:05:06 PM] Miller: i think irregardless of my situation id be tight about getting hit with a cake
[4/28/17, 4:05:24 PM] Donk: Yeah, but people going to his shows likely love that shit
[4/28/17, 4:05:38 PM] Donk: Badge of honor to get nailed by a cake
[4/28/17, 4:05:48 PM] Brian Katz: It was at 4am and we were in a hotel, could be worse
[4/28/17, 4:09:55 PM] Miller: could also be better
[4/28/17, 4:10:00 PM] Miller: you could not have cake all over you
[4/28/17, 4:29:06 PM] Donk: Lol
[4/28/17, 4:29:54 PM] Donk: To be fair,  id be pissed if i spent 100.00 for a show in ny and it was this big of a shit show
[4/28/17, 4:30:34 PM] Dan Watts: i can't imagine
[4/28/17, 4:30:46 PM] Launchpad: definitely
[4/28/17, 4:30:47 PM] Dan Watts: paying that $, flying down there and then seeing that
[4/28/17, 4:30:59 PM] Miller: Oh for sure, I'd actually be pissed if I went for free and I got treated like that
[4/28/17, 4:31:15 PM] Launchpad: how bout dem pants üî•
[4/28/17, 4:31:47 PM] Miller: Herman should get on twitter, I know has he's a big Facebook comments guy but Twitter would be great for his political arguing with everyone
[4/28/17, 4:32:07 PM] Miller: 140 character limit would be rough, he writes some fucking essays on Facebook
[4/28/17, 4:32:16 PM] Donk: The first global citizens festival was a shit show, they sold out of all water and good by like 3pm
[4/28/17, 4:32:28 PM] Donk: But it was free and you could just leave
[4/28/17, 4:32:39 PM] Miller: I would approve of your white pants if you wore this marshmallow head with it
[4/28/17, 4:32:40 PM] Donk: Food that is
[4/28/17, 4:33:01 PM] Miller: Right vs being trapped in a foreign county
[4/28/17, 4:33:15 PM] Launchpad: an actual island
[4/28/17, 4:33:39 PM] Donk: A whole bunch of angry new Yorkers pissed because they couldnt buy $4 bottles.of water
[4/28/17, 4:33:45 PM] Donk: For shame
[4/28/17, 4:34:12 PM] Launchpad: Pasquale's got the free water stations at his festivals smdh
[4/28/17, 4:34:20 PM] Miller: It is pretty ridiculous to run out of water
[4/28/17, 4:34:30 PM] Donk: Yeah, but you pay for those tickets
[4/28/17, 4:34:37 PM] Donk: Thats a free festival
[4/28/17, 4:35:11 PM] Launchpad: makes you really feel like a global citizen
[4/28/17, 4:35:20 PM] Donk: Most fests do have free water though
[4/28/17, 4:35:30 PM] Donk: Esp ones with lots of people om drugs
[4/28/17, 4:35:39 PM] Launchpad: thats just a liability
[4/28/17, 4:36:07 PM] Donk: That lockn festival i went to last year was like standing on the surface of the sun it was so hot, i cant imagine them not giving out free water
[4/28/17, 4:37:18 PM] Justin: I've given up a lot of Facebook arguing
[4/28/17, 4:39:57 PM] Justin: But I mean yeah lp if you pay 12k to go to a concert-presumably 99% of that audience is in a whole different economic class than most Americans- also likely to be the class that will get their money back as they have access to good lawyers -just saying
[4/28/17, 4:40:36 PM] Justin: Hence "white privilege"
[4/28/17, 4:40:50 PM] Donk: If there is any money left
[4/28/17, 4:41:16 PM] Dan Watts: i prob wouldn't take a case like that unless it was class action which i wouldn't have the resources to do
[4/28/17, 4:41:30 PM] Dan Watts: on an individual basis may cost 7500-10k to get that money back
[4/28/17, 4:41:37 PM] Dan Watts: doesn't make financial sense for client
[4/28/17, 4:42:56 PM] Donk: Its going to be interesting to see how it ends up
[4/28/17, 4:43:10 PM] Donk: These island destination concerts are huge these days
[4/28/17, 4:43:15 PM] Justin: Surprised that in cases like that there isn't an emphasis on lawyer fees being paid by accused
[4/28/17, 4:43:20 PM] Miller: Yea but I'm sure you could sue for damages also
[4/28/17, 4:43:46 PM] Dan Watts: in ny emotional distress claims are thrown out unless you to a psych
[4/28/17, 4:44:29 PM] Miller: What about actual distress
[4/28/17, 4:44:38 PM] Justin: Emotional distress aside is t their clearly economic damage being done to them?
[4/28/17, 4:45:12 PM] Justin: But your saying the bread and butter would be from "long term effects"
[4/28/17, 4:45:35 PM] Dan Watts: they get the 12k back plus whatever additional costs incurred, e.g. hotels flights etc
[4/28/17, 4:46:18 PM] Dan Watts: most of these festivals have arbitration clauses
[4/28/17, 4:47:30 PM] Miller: Hotel flights etc was all included with their ticket cost
[4/28/17, 4:47:45 PM] Dan Watts: i'm sure there will be some sort of class action set up, or maybe they'll just do the right thing and automatically refund everyone
[4/28/17, 4:47:55 PM] Miller: Part of the issue because when shit got fucked up it slipped over into their flights home
[4/28/17, 4:48:23 PM] Launchpad: having a spare 12k to go to a music festival is not 'white privilege' you dickhead.  If I were to ask 100 white people if they would spend 12k on a music festival I would probably get 100 nos
[4/28/17, 4:48:39 PM] Justin: You just don't get it
[4/28/17, 4:48:59 PM] Brian Katz: What acts are there
[4/28/17, 4:49:05 PM] Miller: Blink 182
[4/28/17, 4:49:12 PM] Launchpad: I don't
[4/28/17, 4:49:12 PM] Brian Katz: That's it?
[4/28/17, 4:49:16 PM] Miller: Well they cancelled
[4/28/17, 4:49:16 PM] Launchpad: I really don't
[4/28/17, 4:49:19 PM] Justin: I get that and it's not worth it
[4/28/17, 4:49:25 PM] Launchpad: Only white people have access to 12k?
[4/28/17, 4:49:33 PM] Justin: You really just do t get it
[4/28/17, 4:49:50 PM] Justin: Like not even in the ball park
[4/28/17, 4:49:51 PM] Brian Katz: Damn I saw blink for like $40 at Jones beach
[4/28/17, 4:50:03 PM] Miller: And that was also on an island
[4/28/17, 4:50:11 PM] Brian Katz: Right?
[4/28/17, 4:50:15 PM] Justin: If the word white wasn't in it, would you no longer object?
[4/28/17, 4:50:26 PM] Brian Katz: Probably
[4/28/17, 4:50:39 PM] Launchpad: I would probably be less objectionable
[4/28/17, 4:50:39 PM] Dan Watts: major lazer migos desiigner
[4/28/17, 4:50:41 PM] Dan Watts: disclosure
[4/28/17, 4:51:07 PM] Brian Katz: Disclosure? Lol the 80's new wave band?
[4/28/17, 4:51:10 PM] Launchpad: Ja Rule's better check his White Privilege
[4/28/17, 4:51:12 PM] Justin: Because black people can still have the same advantages white people have known as white privilege. Many white people dont have many of the advantages of white privilege.
[4/28/17, 4:51:37 PM] Justin: But the concept to you means oh I'm white therefore I have privilege---fuck that blah blah blah
[4/28/17, 4:51:57 PM] Miller: I say going forward we just rename it Herman privilege
[4/28/17, 4:52:04 PM] Justin: It's about a system of opportunity and exploitation
[4/28/17, 4:52:18 PM] Dan Watts: ja rule was appropriating rich white culture
[4/28/17, 4:52:26 PM] Brian Katz: You do realize you're white herman, right?
[4/28/17, 4:52:27 PM] Justin: Some aspects will always exist due to racism. Some aspects are economics based
[4/28/17, 4:52:45 PM] Miller: Ja rule realistically had nothing to do with any of this besides being invested in the company who put it on
[4/28/17, 4:52:50 PM] Dan Watts: #whiteexploitation
[4/28/17, 4:53:07 PM] Launchpad: What I see is 30 year olds complaining about how their birth pedigree fucked them over for life instead of actually manning up and taking control of their own destiny
[4/28/17, 4:53:26 PM] Justin: Yeh that's all you see
[4/28/17, 4:53:30 PM] Justin: I say the word welfare
[4/28/17, 4:53:33 PM] Justin: What do you see
[4/28/17, 4:53:38 PM] Justin: Tell me honestly.
[4/28/17, 4:53:55 PM] Justin: What person do you envision?
[4/28/17, 4:54:01 PM] Dan Watts: white women are the largest recepients of welfare
[4/28/17, 4:54:09 PM] Justin: Didn't ask for reality
[4/28/17, 4:54:21 PM] Justin: Wanted his perception an honest one which I doubt I'd ever get
[4/28/17, 4:54:26 PM] Launchpad: I have a guess what you envision, because you see race EVERYWHERE
[4/28/17, 4:54:36 PM] Justin: Lol not answering the fucken question
[4/28/17, 4:54:37 PM] Miller: Goddamn white women, first you elect trump and now you take all the welfare
[4/28/17, 4:54:42 PM] Justin: Fine I see a black man
[4/28/17, 4:54:44 PM] Justin: I won't lie
[4/28/17, 4:54:49 PM] Justin: And I know the statistics
[4/28/17, 4:55:00 PM] Justin: Now time for some honesty from you.
[4/28/17, 4:55:23 PM] Miller: Time to play some truth or truth
[4/28/17, 4:55:26 PM] Justin: Sure as fuck do t envision a white child
[4/28/17, 4:55:41 PM] Launchpad: My honest opinion? If you blame where you come from for why you're a failure in life right now you're a fucken loser
[4/28/17, 4:55:54 PM] Justin: Ok still didn't answer question so game is over
[4/28/17, 4:56:03 PM] Justin: Keep rewinding back to that strawman
[4/28/17, 4:56:02 PM] Miller: Shots fired Friday in full effect
[4/28/17, 4:56:09 PM] Launchpad: its a stupid game
[4/28/17, 4:56:35 PM] Miller: But if you do that will your girlfriend cheat on you?
[4/28/17, 4:56:42 PM] Justin: No one needs to blame anything. It's about perceptions that distort real outcomes
[4/28/17, 4:57:08 PM] Justin: Which you just don't get. You actually refuse at all levels to ask yourself "what are my preconceived notions about people".
[4/28/17, 4:57:30 PM] Brian Katz: Herman you act like you know the plight of the poor man, but you grew up with mad white privilege. Your parents were both college educated, you're dad was a foreman of his union making well over 100k. You had an education in one of the best school districts, private baseball lessons, and what did you do with it? Poker player. So it's not all white privilege, it's each person that controls their destiny. Some just start the game with more, so they can screw up some.
[4/28/17, 4:57:35 PM] Justin: Instead you claim that is bullshit blah blah fucken losers take responsibility blah blah I had nothing blah blah
[4/28/17, 4:57:40 PM] Launchpad: it actually sounds like you want me to admit I'm racially biased
[4/28/17, 4:58:17 PM] Miller: I know poor people
[4/28/17, 4:58:19 PM] Miller: I've DJed for them
[4/28/17, 4:58:19 PM] Launchpad: yup, fuck all those assholes who would rather read about how life is unfair, rather than read about business
[4/28/17, 4:58:39 PM] Justin: Katz I don't get what your argument is
[4/28/17, 4:58:55 PM] Justin: I had opportunity and blew it I suppose?
[4/28/17, 4:59:13 PM] Justin: How does that change the reality of how people are treated differently.
[4/28/17, 4:59:34 PM] Brian Katz: My argument is you've had "white privilege" and what has that done for you? You have to get what you want in this life
[4/28/17, 4:59:57 PM] Justin: As watts pointed out white women and white children are the number one receiver of welfare. My brain however envisions a black man. Why is that?  Cue lp saying because i see race. As if everyone doesn't fucken see race
[4/28/17, 5:00:21 PM] Brian Katz: People with money are treated differently. OJ Simpson is a good example. Is that black privilege?
[4/28/17, 5:00:26 PM] Launchpad: honestly I don't care what peoples race is
[4/28/17, 5:00:38 PM] Miller: What about black Tim?
[4/28/17, 5:00:59 PM] Justin: That's why I said you can be black and not experience the effects of white privlige. As you can be white and not experience the benefits of a lot of it
[4/28/17, 5:01:20 PM] Justin: It's class based as well as social perceptions based
[4/28/17, 5:01:50 PM] Launchpad: what if you're white and you grew up in a trailer park in West Virginia? Don't you think you'd get tired of the term White Privilege and think its bullshit?
[4/28/17, 5:01:55 PM] Justin: It's just a word used  to address inherent stereotypes that effect outcome
[4/28/17, 5:02:21 PM] Justin: Ok once again that's why I asked you who do you see as someone on welfare
[4/28/17, 5:02:32 PM] Justin: Because the reality is it's that guy in a trailer park
[4/28/17, 5:03:27 PM] Launchpad: awwww Herman just wants me to say that I envision a po black man who smokes crack and rapes white women
[4/28/17, 5:03:44 PM] Justin: I give up
[4/28/17, 5:04:17 PM] Justin: I just want you to point out outcome or circumstance of being white isn't white privilege
[4/28/17, 5:04:26 PM] Justin: It's about opportunity and perception.
[4/28/17, 5:04:57 PM] Justin: But you don't get that literally at all. You see the word white and rage
[4/28/17, 5:05:24 PM] Launchpad: so you mean 'white' like pure, not white as in skin color
[4/28/17, 5:05:53 PM] Launchpad: which means its a stupid fucken term if you want people to sympathize with you
[4/28/17, 5:06:08 PM] Justin: I mean how people perceive you, how you perceive yourself, opportunity presented to a median of people like ourself versus other groups...etc
[4/28/17, 5:06:12 PM] Miller: It's also the misunderstanding of using it in the sense that devalues the idea of people accomplishing anything, which I don't think is actually your intention but can definitely come across that way
[4/28/17, 5:06:32 PM] Justin: Yeh when I used it before I meant for access to lawyers
[4/28/17, 5:06:42 PM] Justin: The means to retain a lawyer in the first place
[4/28/17, 5:07:06 PM] Launchpad: only whites can afford lawyers
[4/28/17, 5:07:11 PM] Justin: I pointed out there class as it's own thing because like you said lp. I don't know a fucken person hat would pay 12k to go to a concert
[4/28/17, 5:07:14 PM] Justin: Lol
[4/28/17, 5:07:19 PM] Justin: And we're back
[4/28/17, 5:07:48 PM] Miller: 12k for a Taylor Swift Joe Budden jayz festival on a private island including transportation?
[4/28/17, 5:07:53 PM] Miller: ü§î
[4/28/17, 5:07:55 PM] Launchpad: so its really a rich / poor thing, but you decide to include race
[4/28/17, 5:08:23 PM] Justin: closest i could get
[4/28/17, 5:08:44 PM] Justin: welli mean a jay z ticket these days costs like 500$ so in that context
[4/28/17, 5:09:32 PM] Miller: Just adding some context people thought they were getting a private jet for a 3 day vacation on a private island
[4/28/17, 5:09:43 PM] Miller: Not quite the same as paying 12k for a concert
[4/28/17, 5:10:33 PM] Justin: its a rich poor thing, its  a cultural thing, and its a social cognitive bias thing... it's not just one thing its a broad term to answer the question of why do we see such varying outcomes between races when we look at people in similar situations
[4/28/17, 5:11:22 PM] Launchpad: so its not a racial thing...yet you decide to make it into one
[4/28/17, 5:12:08 PM] Justin: its underlying premise is about race- I mean if you wnat you can take literlaly the only other argument which is black people are inferior genetically- go for it
[4/28/17, 5:12:29 PM] Justin: the data is there, the outcomes are different- so why ar ethe outcomes different
[4/28/17, 5:12:50 PM] Justin: answer "white privilege"-which is all the things above
[4/28/17, 5:13:12 PM] Dan Watts: read the work of charles murray
[4/28/17, 5:13:27 PM] Dan Watts: he was on the sam harris podcast
[4/28/17, 5:13:34 PM] Brian Katz: There was about 24 new black millionaires made last night. They could all afford a 12k private island concert now
[4/28/17, 5:13:49 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/forbidden-knowledge
[4/28/17, 5:14:00 PM] Justin: and some guy has a 14 inch dick and is awesome
[4/28/17, 5:14:11 PM] Justin: leterlaly one was just born todday with a 12 inch dick
[4/28/17, 5:14:13 PM] Launchpad: so its all that....and yet I don't want to talk about it because all you keep doing is throwing around the term 'white privilege' which offends me, because it insinuates I did not work for what I have
[4/28/17, 5:14:28 PM] Justin: well ive been trolling you for days with it
[4/28/17, 5:14:31 PM] Justin: so theres that
[4/28/17, 5:14:42 PM] Miller: Also you shouldn't let words bother you
[4/28/17, 5:14:53 PM] Miller: Stop being so PC
[4/28/17, 5:14:59 PM] Launchpad: we've gone full circle
[4/28/17, 5:15:09 PM] Steve: Not before katz looks them up in websters
[4/28/17, 5:17:52 PM] Brian Katz: I don't care if anyone uses it, Herman's just a hypocrite
[4/28/17, 5:18:09 PM] Justin: once again - you dont get it either
[4/28/17, 5:18:54 PM] Brian Katz: Herman this is retarded truce lol
[4/28/17, 5:19:47 PM] Launchpad: I was not born a millionaire therefore I can never be a millionaire...boo fucken hoo
[4/28/17, 5:20:36 PM] Sean: Yeah my parents were pretty poor living in an apartment in Manhattan and now they're all killing the game
[4/28/17, 5:20:52 PM] Sean: 12 per apartment in manhattan*
[4/28/17, 5:21:30 PM] Brian Katz: You're really overkilling the Gifs Herm
[4/28/17, 5:21:32 PM] Launchpad: JH would have you believe its not possible
[4/28/17, 5:21:46 PM] Justin: actually waht do you think my asnwer to that is?
[4/28/17, 5:22:19 PM] Steve: I think you should look up the definition of hypocrite
[4/28/17, 5:22:19 PM] Steve: Or not, don't really care
[4/28/17, 5:22:45 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/28/17, 5:22:46 PM] Justin: i'd think that nearly every single one of my friends likely has a success story?  Hmmm. how could i draw that conclusion?
[4/28/17, 5:22:51 PM] Steve: That's not what he is saying at all
[4/28/17, 5:23:03 PM] Sean: I'm saying they came here 0 English no help bc people were racist bc they were Hispanic and my grandparents did there thing and were successful
[4/28/17, 5:23:11 PM] Steve: Great
[4/28/17, 5:23:22 PM] Steve: That's not his point with white privilege
[4/28/17, 5:23:44 PM] Sean: I'm just saying it is possible for minorities to get ahead on life
[4/28/17, 5:23:54 PM] Sean: My sister is doing better then most of her white friends
[4/28/17, 5:23:54 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[4/28/17, 5:23:56 PM] Justin: could it be that we generally create groups of friends alongside socio-economic means, be them black, white, or brown?
[4/28/17, 5:23:58 PM] Sean: Bc she worked for it
[4/28/17, 5:24:11 PM] Steve: And that's amazing
[4/28/17, 5:24:19 PM] Steve: But your sister grew up in bayside right?
[4/28/17, 5:24:23 PM] Steve: In a nice house?
[4/28/17, 5:24:27 PM] Brian Katz: Your friends can be anyone
[4/28/17, 5:24:33 PM] Steve: With parents that fostered her education?
[4/28/17, 5:24:43 PM] Steve: And we're able to give her whatever she needed?
[4/28/17, 5:24:48 PM] Steve: Just like mine and Hermans
[4/28/17, 5:24:50 PM] Sean: Yeah bc her minority family who came from nothing allowed that
[4/28/17, 5:24:50 PM] Justin: 22% of americans are on welfare...not a single one of my friends are on welfare
[4/28/17, 5:24:52 PM] Justin: hmmm
[4/28/17, 5:25:00 PM] Justin: thatz crazy.. what a coincidence
[4/28/17, 5:25:07 PM] Justin: what are the odds
[4/28/17, 5:25:07 PM] Brian Katz: My friend Kev lives in the projects in Brooklyn
[4/28/17, 5:25:19 PM] Sean: My cousins all grew up in the projects on my moms sode
[4/28/17, 5:25:35 PM] Steve: And that's great that they have come out
[4/28/17, 5:25:41 PM] Justin: ok now try to get to 20%
[4/28/17, 5:25:45 PM] Justin: try to get to 10%
[4/28/17, 5:25:48 PM] Justin: fuck try to get to 5%
[4/28/17, 5:26:31 PM] Justin: class is usually a strucutre that is invisible but is still filtering what we see and know
[4/28/17, 5:26:48 PM] Justin: how many girls get pregnant by 16?
[4/28/17, 5:26:51 PM] Justin: what percentage
[4/28/17, 5:27:19 PM] Justin: apprently down to 9%
[4/28/17, 5:27:26 PM] Justin: i cant name a single girl in my high school that got pregnant
[4/28/17, 5:27:32 PM] Justin: hmm
[4/28/17, 5:27:35 PM] Justin: so weird
[4/28/17, 5:28:25 PM] Sean: Listen. Point blank you can down play my family coming from scrubbing shit out of toilets and living in the hood to what they are today all you want. They did what they had to and they were treated like the scum of the earth the entire process. Didn't stop them. White privilege didn't affect them bc they didn't give a fuck. They love in the hoods and worked there way out
[4/28/17, 5:28:27 PM] Steve: Those are great successes
[4/28/17, 5:28:28 PM] Steve: More often than not, that doesn't happen
[4/28/17, 5:28:29 PM] Steve: Your family obviously is one of the exceptions
[4/28/17, 5:28:42 PM] Justin: and thats how i know you
[4/28/17, 5:28:42 PM] Sean: So you can throw numbers all you want at me if people want to succeed they can
[4/28/17, 5:29:01 PM] Dan Watts: my mom runs a mentoring program in brownsville. 1 in 8 kids in her progam have an open ACS case
[4/28/17, 5:29:10 PM] Steve: Lol ok sean
[4/28/17, 5:29:11 PM] Brian Katz: Can it be more often than not people don't succeed?
[4/28/17, 5:29:50 PM] Justin: well that is an accurate statement, specifically modern day
[4/28/17, 5:30:01 PM] Justin: but the point is there is still disparity in race
[4/28/17, 5:30:17 PM] Steve: Sample size
[4/28/17, 5:30:20 PM] Justin: now it oculd be the prison industrial complex, it could be racial biases, it could be genetics, it could be alot of things---but it exists
[4/28/17, 5:30:25 PM] Steve: My family did it
[4/28/17, 5:30:25 PM] Steve: Every family can
[4/28/17, 5:30:25 PM] Steve: No excuses
[4/28/17, 5:30:25 PM] Steve: But watts, they have tonjust work hard at it
[4/28/17, 5:30:25 PM] Steve: And they will make it
[4/28/17, 5:30:25 PM] Steve: It's that easy
[4/28/17, 5:30:25 PM] Steve: No excuses!
[4/28/17, 5:30:50 PM] Dan Watts: dude- there's physical abuse going on
[4/28/17, 5:30:54 PM] Dan Watts: white people didn't do that to them
[4/28/17, 5:30:56 PM] Steve: Guy
[4/28/17, 5:30:58 PM] Dan Watts: theres 0 accountability
[4/28/17, 5:31:17 PM] Justin: crazy is most of those households are likely singl eparent homes
[4/28/17, 5:31:24 PM] Justin: so its the mom beating the kid presumably
[4/28/17, 5:31:33 PM] Brian Katz: I've tried to help out five people now to lose weight. I have had 1 success 1 working progress and 3 failures. You have to want to change yourself, no matter how much privilege you have.
[4/28/17, 5:32:23 PM] Launchpad: üëç
[4/28/17, 5:32:26 PM] Justin: ok thats with weight loss
[4/28/17, 5:32:38 PM] Justin: what if you have a metabolic deficency?>
[4/28/17, 5:33:01 PM] Brian Katz: Same as with anything herman. It takes hard work, and dedication that most people do not have
[4/28/17, 5:33:02 PM] Justin: would you then yell that same statement at that person that has a disease stopping them form losing weight?
[4/28/17, 5:33:17 PM] Justin: katz, how hard did you work to get where you arE?
[4/28/17, 5:33:16 PM] Brian Katz: That's not why they failed
[4/28/17, 5:33:19 PM] Steve: My point is their are many many situations where you can't just work hed to get out of
[4/28/17, 5:33:19 PM] Steve: Did you really miss that point?
[4/28/17, 5:33:19 PM] Steve: Give yourself and over the head signal
[4/28/17, 5:33:33 PM] Justin: being that im being thrown under the bus
[4/28/17, 5:33:46 PM] Justin: did you get good grades in school?
[4/28/17, 5:33:53 PM] Justin: did you go to a good college?
[4/28/17, 5:34:38 PM] Brian Katz: I didn't work hard to get this opportunity it was given to me. But I'm trying to work hard to continue this opportunity for my children. I want my company to be around when my kids are grown, so they can hand it to there's
[4/28/17, 5:34:40 PM] Sean: I did
[4/28/17, 5:34:44 PM] Sean: My whole damn life
[4/28/17, 5:34:52 PM] Brian Katz: Theirs*
[4/28/17, 5:34:55 PM] Sean: And my ass got beat if I didn't perform well or misbehaved
[4/28/17, 5:34:56 PM] Justin: so why isnt your example proving the negative
[4/28/17, 5:35:08 PM] Justin: why can you use my example as proof of privlige not existing
[4/28/17, 5:35:11 PM] Brian Katz: What example?
[4/28/17, 5:35:14 PM] Justin: and then ignore your own example
[4/28/17, 5:35:22 PM] Sean: I'm Hispanic
[4/28/17, 5:35:25 PM] Justin: i grew up in nice house hold etc etc and now paly poker
[4/28/17, 5:35:25 PM] Sean: I'm not even white
[4/28/17, 5:35:27 PM] Brian Katz: We know
[4/28/17, 5:35:31 PM] Steve: Again, sean, I think you are missing what white privilege means.
[4/28/17, 5:35:45 PM] Sean: No i don't but thank you
[4/28/17, 5:36:00 PM] Steve: From your statements it's clear you do
[4/28/17, 5:36:02 PM] Justin: the point is netiher of our examples are proof or disproof of privlige.  By the aggregate there is proof.
[4/28/17, 5:36:07 PM] Sean: You're just making excuses for people not working hard enough to succeed. I failed at weight loss how many times?
[4/28/17, 5:36:09 PM] Brian Katz: Because you have no aspersions herman. You couldve become a successful lawyer, but you chose poker because it requires little from you
[4/28/17, 5:36:55 PM] Justin: ok well what if i had to tkae care of my parents at 18?
[4/28/17, 5:37:01 PM] Justin: could i go to colelge and law school?
[4/28/17, 5:37:06 PM] Brian Katz: Yes
[4/28/17, 5:37:11 PM] Justin: really
[4/28/17, 5:37:16 PM] Brian Katz: It would be very difficult but you could
[4/28/17, 5:37:30 PM] Brian Katz: Why couldn't you? What's stopping you?
[4/28/17, 5:37:32 PM] Launchpad: you would have to sacrifice your life of never having a real job
[4/28/17, 5:37:38 PM] Brian Katz: Excuses are for cowards
[4/28/17, 5:37:43 PM] Sean: You could definitely do it
[4/28/17, 5:38:03 PM] Sean: Take me I fail at weight loss bc it's gets hard and I quit
[4/28/17, 5:38:07 PM] Sean: I own that it's my fault
[4/28/17, 5:38:13 PM] Justin: omg with the weight loss
[4/28/17, 5:38:15 PM] Steve: Lol
[4/28/17, 5:38:19 PM] Justin: ok fine how the fuck did i lose 60 pounds 2 x
[4/28/17, 5:38:18 PM] Sean: I had all the tools. Katz helping me
[4/28/17, 5:38:22 PM] Justin: i have no will power
[4/28/17, 5:38:24 PM] Justin: how oculd i ahve done that
[4/28/17, 5:38:25 PM] Steve: That's not what I'm doing at all
[4/28/17, 5:38:27 PM] Justin: it makes no sense
[4/28/17, 5:38:36 PM] Brian Katz: Because you're semi motivated
[4/28/17, 5:38:36 PM] Launchpad: weightloss is a metaphor for life
[4/28/17, 5:38:39 PM] Justin: i put no energy into life- i must just got lucky
[4/28/17, 5:38:42 PM] Justin: no tis fucken not
[4/28/17, 5:38:53 PM] Justin: weight loss is literally about eating less calories then you expend
[4/28/17, 5:38:55 PM] Justin: thats fucken it
[4/28/17, 5:38:58 PM] Brian Katz: Why did you gain it back is the better question? Why are you still not where you wanna be
[4/28/17, 5:39:02 PM] Justin: theres no bias involved in it
[4/28/17, 5:39:05 PM] Justin: no class involved in it
[4/28/17, 5:39:13 PM] Justin: no anything involved in it other than calories
[4/28/17, 5:39:21 PM] Justin: its a fucken stupid comparrison
[4/28/17, 5:39:37 PM] Brian Katz: Is it just calories? Or is it self discipline
[4/28/17, 5:39:46 PM] Sean: Def self discipline
[4/28/17, 5:39:53 PM] Sean: Or I would've been able to do it years ago
[4/28/17, 5:39:57 PM] Justin: so i ahve self discipline is what your telling me?
[4/28/17, 5:40:02 PM] Launchpad: self discipline
[4/28/17, 5:40:03 PM] Sean: And I have failed over and over and over again
[4/28/17, 5:40:06 PM] Justin: which one is it?  I thoguht i dont and thats why im a poker player
[4/28/17, 5:40:11 PM] Brian Katz: No you don't
[4/28/17, 5:40:23 PM] Justin: so how did i lose 50 pounds plus 2 times already
[4/28/17, 5:40:37 PM] Brian Katz: You gained it back twice too herman
[4/28/17, 5:40:46 PM] Justin: better quertion.  did i lose that discipline when i gained weight back?
[4/28/17, 5:40:50 PM] Brian Katz: That's why you're still not where you want to be
[4/28/17, 5:40:52 PM] Justin: or did circumstances change in my life
[4/28/17, 5:40:55 PM] Brian Katz: Yes
[4/28/17, 5:41:00 PM] Brian Katz: Like what?
[4/28/17, 5:41:12 PM] Brian Katz: You've never gone through any real strife?
[4/28/17, 5:41:18 PM] Justin: well i started dating for the first time in ym life and prioritized that over healthy eating and the gym
[4/28/17, 5:41:22 PM] Brian Katz: You can't blame it on work
[4/28/17, 5:41:39 PM] Brian Katz: So what that should incentivize you to keep it off
[4/28/17, 5:41:44 PM] Justin: weight loss is fully under ones control
[4/28/17, 5:41:48 PM] Justin: its a very dumb comparison
[4/28/17, 5:41:55 PM] Justin: there are no external factors
[4/28/17, 5:42:03 PM] Miller: Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows. It‚Äôs a very mean and nasty place and I don‚Äôt care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain‚Äôt about how hard ya hit. It‚Äôs about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That‚Äôs how winning is done! Now if you know what you‚Äôre worth then go out and get what you‚Äôre worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain‚Äôt where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain‚Äôt you! You‚Äôre better than that!
[4/28/17, 5:42:09 PM] Brian Katz: No it's not. If you put in the work then you'll get results
[4/28/17, 5:42:11 PM] Justin: its a controlled environment.  If i set my mind to becoming a scientist i cant just become a scientist
[4/28/17, 5:42:24 PM] Justin: but that sthe point
[4/28/17, 5:42:34 PM] Brian Katz: Thank you miller balboa underrated flick
[4/28/17, 5:42:42 PM] Justin: we are taking people from similar upbringing, cmparing result, and their is a dispartiy
[4/28/17, 5:42:47 PM] Justin: there*
[4/28/17, 5:43:03 PM] Brian Katz: I have no idea what your point is. All I know is that there's always an excuse.
[4/28/17, 5:43:28 PM] Steve: Lol sound familiar @16318489683?
[4/28/17, 5:43:41 PM] Justin: my excuse kats is if your mom was black, and in 50% income level of black family, what do you think your life would be like when she got pregnant at 16?
[4/28/17, 5:43:50 PM] Steve: Game recognizes game grandpa, and you looking kinda unfamiliar right now!
[4/28/17, 5:44:18 PM] Justin: if you cant see that, i dont know what the fuck to tell you
[4/28/17, 5:44:45 PM] Steve: Is the boondocks still on?
[4/28/17, 5:44:57 PM] Steve: Man I miss that show
[4/28/17, 5:45:24 PM] Justin: lets take your situation.  You did poor in school, and you don't graduate high school.  Now what opportunities would bizzaro katz have had?
[4/28/17, 5:45:24 PM] Brian Katz: It would've been drastically different. I'm not going to pretend that I know what that would mean for me, but if I wanted to get out of there, it's up to me and no one else. If I didn't make it out, there's not some invisible man holding me back, I could only look into the mirror for the person that held me back.
[4/28/17, 5:45:49 PM] Brian Katz: I didn't do poor in school
[4/28/17, 5:46:12 PM] Brian Katz: I would have made it
[4/28/17, 5:46:17 PM] Justin: fine you skip school, what do you think would ahve happened?
[4/28/17, 5:46:33 PM] Launchpad: whos fault is that? Moms?
[4/28/17, 5:46:35 PM] Launchpad: society?
[4/28/17, 5:46:47 PM] Brian Katz: Do I go to work? Do I learn a craft?
[4/28/17, 5:46:50 PM] Justin: it's not about fault its baout oppurtunity
[4/28/17, 5:47:00 PM] Justin: thats why there is a large class argument
[4/28/17, 5:47:25 PM] Brian Katz: It's you who decides his fate bud
[4/28/17, 5:47:30 PM] Justin: most minorities don't have those oppurtunities becuase they are in a lower economic class... they start at an inherent disadvantage
[4/28/17, 5:47:55 PM] Steve: Katz that's slightly naive
[4/28/17, 5:47:56 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah, but that's life, we'll never all be equal
[4/28/17, 5:48:04 PM] Sean: That's what I said my parents started as
[4/28/17, 5:48:09 PM] Sean: Why does that example not count?
[4/28/17, 5:48:18 PM] Steve: Thinking that you are the one that controls your life and only you is crazy
[4/28/17, 5:48:35 PM] Justin: firs tof all takign your parnets sean a generation which saw leaps and bounds in social mobility and comparing it to ours is pretty useless at this point
[4/28/17, 5:48:41 PM] Brian Katz: Thinking that you don't is crazy steve
[4/28/17, 5:49:07 PM] Steve: And example is if a kid grows up in a family where the men are all gang members and from and early age youbare taught that is the way of life
[4/28/17, 5:49:20 PM] Steve: What percentage do you give that hold of "making his own life"?
[4/28/17, 5:49:30 PM] Justin: yeh ims ure katz you would been like nah im not cutting school to hang out i gotta get good grades
[4/28/17, 5:49:30 PM] Steve: 5%? 10%?
[4/28/17, 5:49:36 PM] Steve: 100%?
[4/28/17, 5:49:46 PM] Justin: thats what 14 year old bizaro katz would have said to himself?
[4/28/17, 5:49:48 PM] Brian Katz: You worked a pizzeria unos and ran that joint. It was cushy I'm sure. Did you stay there forever? Or did you want more out of life steve? Is anyone else responsible for that change?
[4/28/17, 5:50:12 PM] Steve: That's because my father gave me a loan for more shopping
[4/28/17, 5:50:21 PM] Steve: *schooling
[4/28/17, 5:50:25 PM] Justin: by that standard you are useless if you fail at a business
[4/28/17, 5:50:26 PM] Steve: If not, I'd still be there
[4/28/17, 5:50:29 PM] Steve: Or maybe worse
[4/28/17, 5:50:31 PM] Brian Katz: You could've taken a loan as well
[4/28/17, 5:50:33 PM] Justin: is it result or trying that matters?
[4/28/17, 5:50:47 PM] Steve: Yes, with 25% interest
[4/28/17, 5:50:49 PM] Justin: defintiely for more shipping
[4/28/17, 5:50:52 PM] Justin: i seen your wardrobe
[4/28/17, 5:50:58 PM] Justin: shopping*
[4/28/17, 5:51:04 PM] Steve: I shop Tj maxx
[4/28/17, 5:51:05 PM] Brian Katz: Do or do not there is no try ( mother fucking Yoda)
[4/28/17, 5:51:11 PM] Justin: and not everyone can get a loan katz
[4/28/17, 5:51:25 PM] Justin: specifically less liekly to get loans are minorities without capital or credit histroy
[4/28/17, 5:51:34 PM] Steve: Also a fact
[4/28/17, 5:51:34 PM] Brian Katz: They kept giving them to Brendan and ej
[4/28/17, 5:51:42 PM] Launchpad: clearly the only solution is to smoke crack, give up on life, and blame society
[4/28/17, 5:51:43 PM] Justin: but hey that sthere fault obviously that there parents were poor and minority
[4/28/17, 5:51:45 PM] Steve: I actually couldn't even get a car without my dad consigning
[4/28/17, 5:51:52 PM] Steve: Guess what my credit score was katz?
[4/28/17, 5:52:08 PM] Justin: clearly you have terrible racial biases if you think the two options are get a loan or smoke crack and give up
[4/28/17, 5:52:09 PM] Brian Katz: 400 steve
[4/28/17, 5:52:13 PM] Steve: 750
[4/28/17, 5:52:14 PM] Justin: but thanks for highlighting that
[4/28/17, 5:52:21 PM] Steve: And I still needed a consigner
[4/28/17, 5:52:31 PM] Launchpad: why is that racial bias?
[4/28/17, 5:53:03 PM] Justin: üò¶üî´üî´
[4/28/17, 5:53:17 PM] Brian Katz: Double squirt guns
[4/28/17, 5:53:17 PM] Launchpad: here we go, time to put people back into their boxes again
[4/28/17, 5:53:21 PM] Steve: Are those water guns?
[4/28/17, 5:53:30 PM] Justin: yeh iw oudlnt kill myself over lp
[4/28/17, 5:53:46 PM] Justin: although i did ask joia to bring me a gun and a bullet 20 minutes ago

[4/28/17, 5:55:27 PM] Justin: jsut felt like it brought some levity
[4/28/17, 5:55:28 PM] Launchpad: herman is mad that we wont admit an overwhemling segment of the population is completely helpless
[4/28/17, 5:55:43 PM] Justin: nah i dont care, you can think whatever you wnat

[4/28/17, 8:05:26 PM] Dan Watts: Should be considered a terrorist
[4/28/17, 8:06:41 PM] Dan Watts: But Muslim terrorist attacks so far outnumber terrorist attacks by other groups you it's impossible to say that Muslims are being unfairly targeted relative to other groups
[4/28/17, 8:07:02 PM] Dan Watts: Just look at the numbers
[4/28/17, 8:21:35 PM] Justin: Just saying it's never called a terrorist attack unless guys  Muslim
[4/28/17, 8:21:57 PM] Justin: And it's always called terrorist attack if he's Muslim. Irregardless of actual meaning of the word.
[4/28/17, 9:05:41 PM] Dan Watts: Aaron judge üíâüíâüíâ

[4/29/17, 10:24:08 PM] Justin: So you are taking said girl out in upper east side?
[4/29/17, 10:24:56 PM] Justin: And was the fact hat she directly works under you in a subordinant position and has a sexual relation with you a sarcastic "good thing"?
[4/29/17, 10:28:49 PM] Scott: That's different girl
[4/29/17, 10:28:59 PM] Scott: And I'm taking some girl I went online out for a drink tomorrow
[4/29/17, 10:29:27 PM] Brian Katz: Just one though, cheese ain't made of money
[4/29/17, 10:30:40 PM] Brian Katz: Btw Donk who's in first now? Let's go yanks

[4/30/17, 12:25:49 PM] Scott: Says my roommate in Austin
[4/30/17, 5:03:51 PM] Kiyoon: Forgot about that we won the series though #stevelogic
[4/30/17, 5:05:17 PM] Steve: I don't think I've ever said that
[4/30/17, 5:05:31 PM] Steve: But sure, #stevelogic everything

[5/1/17, 7:50:50 AM] Steve: (Sean, katz, and scott don't believe it)
[5/1/17, 7:50:50 AM] Steve: Their minds: "fake news!"
[5/1/17, 11:26:45 AM] Miller: syndergaard officially dead, you may get my hibachi katz but at least your fantasy team will suffer
[5/1/17, 11:29:20 AM] Miller: https://www.instagram.com/p/BThzkF1lQzO/ dont watch this at work w/your speakers on
[5/1/17, 11:39:48 AM] Scott: Tommy John?
[5/1/17, 11:40:03 AM] Miller: torn lat
[5/1/17, 11:40:03 AM] Steve: Torn lat
[5/1/17, 11:40:19 AM] Miller: well played
[5/1/17, 11:40:28 AM] Miller: i almost sent it just after you
[5/1/17, 11:40:38 AM] Miller: which would have put us into an enless cycle of new launchpads
[5/1/17, 11:41:37 AM] Steve: Never ending
[5/1/17, 11:43:28 AM] Dan Watts: that kid made me lol
[5/1/17, 11:43:59 AM] Miller: kid needs to relax
[5/1/17, 11:44:09 AM] Miller: he has another 60 years of the mets torturing him
[5/1/17, 11:44:24 AM] Miller: unless he has an aneurysm at 14
[5/1/17, 11:45:41 AM] Steve: Or he becomes a Yankees fan
[5/1/17, 11:46:15 AM] Miller: or he becomes a woman and can no longer feed himself
[5/1/17, 11:46:19 AM] Miller: anything is possible
[5/1/17, 11:46:25 AM] Steve: Eh
[5/1/17, 11:46:37 AM] Steve: Must have taken a joke out of the cheese book
[5/1/17, 11:46:46 AM] Steve: You're better than that
[5/1/17, 11:46:50 AM] Steve: Want another try?
[5/1/17, 11:47:16 AM] Miller: na, that was funny, you arent the judge and jury on comedy
[5/1/17, 11:47:33 AM] Steve: I can have an opinion
[5/1/17, 11:47:36 AM] Steve: And still wasn't
[5/1/17, 11:47:50 AM] Steve: Bit of a reach
[5/1/17, 12:08:41 PM] Justin: yeh like do we need to hit miller for this
[5/1/17, 12:09:21 PM] Justin: although when i saw you post it this morning figured it had to be a case of the mondays, and you were trolling
[5/1/17, 12:10:04 PM] Miller: i didnt see you share it, saw it on twitter last night but decided to wait until monday to start the week off on the rigiht foot
[5/1/17, 12:10:45 PM] Justin: I figured you were trying to start a war, dangling easy bait
[5/1/17, 12:10:57 PM] Miller: pretty safe bet like 90% of the time
[5/1/17, 12:15:02 PM] Justin: ...
[5/1/17, 12:15:06 PM] Launchpad: OMG this is fucken amazing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDydKwmrHFo
[5/1/17, 12:16:19 PM] Justin: his opening skit was pretty hilarious
[5/1/17, 12:16:24 PM] Launchpad: Thank You Herman would be more appropriate
[5/1/17, 12:16:33 PM] Justin: talked about white privilege
[5/1/17, 12:18:23 PM] Justin: http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/04/09/watch_louis_c_k_s_profane_hilarious_snl_opening_monologue.html
[5/1/17, 12:18:47 PM] Miller: that was pretty great

[5/1/17, 12:20:54 PM] Dan Watts: Dems trying to do same thing here.  Just like they said brexit wouldnt happen with trump it did.  NOT GOOD!
[5/1/17, 12:21:19 PM] Justin: lol hard left turn
[5/1/17, 12:21:31 PM] Justin: his party of corporatists abandoned him
[5/1/17, 12:21:59 PM] Justin: the liberals actually joined a coalition with the sum on the right as well
[5/1/17, 12:22:03 PM] Justin: scum*
[5/1/17, 12:26:42 PM] Justin: its exactly what democratic party would do is a scoialist gained power.  The entire corporate funded side of the wing refused to support him and tried to even use the brexit vote to oust him, when the reality is the labor side of labour, wanted to exit
[5/1/17, 12:27:01 PM] Donk: Lol, trumps new Andrew jackson mistake is hilarious
[5/1/17, 12:27:29 PM] Donk: Claiming he hated what he saw in the civil war, when he dies 15 years before it
[5/1/17, 12:28:32 PM] Justin: ‚ÄúHe seems like a throwback to the 1970s,‚Äù
[5/1/17, 12:28:50 PM] Justin: ‚ÄúThe man is living in a cloud cuckoo world,‚Äù said Gareth Bell, a 34-year-old business development manager
[5/1/17, 12:29:21 PM] Justin: didnt actually click on it
[5/1/17, 12:29:29 PM] Justin: figured was more trump being trump
[5/1/17, 12:31:10 PM] Donk: Yep, same as normal
[5/1/17, 12:31:21 PM] Donk: His opinions are facts
[5/1/17, 12:31:28 PM] Donk: And facts are fake news
[5/1/17, 12:31:42 PM] Donk: And so the cycle continues
[5/1/17, 12:33:48 PM] Justin: lol at trump= andrew jackson
[5/1/17, 12:34:22 PM] Justin: he compared himself with a president born into poverty
[5/1/17, 12:34:44 PM] Justin: liekly the only president born into poverty
[5/1/17, 12:49:46 PM] Launchpad: There is no actual substance in this article, just a bunch of mental masterbation
[5/1/17, 12:54:21 PM] Miller: jakes on you i didnt read it
[5/1/17, 12:57:47 PM] Justin: I agree with scott, 15+links in an article to studies and graphs and charts is mental masturbation.  i prefer to read  opinion pieces with no studies sited for my facts
[5/1/17, 12:58:00 PM] Justin: thats why i go to quora
[5/1/17, 12:59:39 PM] Launchpad: funny cause the first 2 links I clicked on didn't actually take me to an article that explained anything but the root page of some websites
[5/1/17, 12:59:48 PM] Justin: also i choose to ignore the outright reality that 2.5 million americans work for the minimum wage, lazy bastards working 40 hours a week for 280$
[5/1/17, 1:00:33 PM] Launchpad: whats also funny is I click on another link and this is what I see:
 New York City ‚Äî A fact sheet released today by the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) shows that, contrary to some common stereotypes about America‚Äôs poor, at least one-third of the 13 million children living in poverty are white.

‚ÄúPoverty affects children of all colors, contrary to stereotypes. The notion held by many Americans that poverty is not a white problem is simply false,‚Äù says Jane Knitzer, EdD, director of NCCP, a research center at Columbia University‚Äôs Mailman School of Public Health. ‚ÄúThe sooner all Americans realize these facts about poverty, the better chance we have of eradicating it.‚Äù
[5/1/17, 1:00:39 PM] Launchpad: #whiteprivlige
[5/1/17, 1:01:01 PM] Justin: and rewind to 48 hours ago where i told you that?
[5/1/17, 1:01:13 PM] Justin: literally i asked you to envision who you see on welfare
[5/1/17, 1:01:15 PM] Justin: literally
[5/1/17, 1:01:19 PM] Justin: fucken literally
[5/1/17, 1:05:19 PM] Launchpad: then why do you constantly keep throwing around the idea that being born white is some sort of guarantee that you'll be successful in life and can do whatever the fuck you want without being arrested
[5/1/17, 1:05:58 PM] Justin: oh god
[5/1/17, 1:06:14 PM] Launchpad: You foster this idea that minorities are completely helpless and being born poor is a death sentence and you can never escape the projectw
[5/1/17, 1:06:27 PM] Justin: thats not at all what i foster, thats what you assume
[5/1/17, 1:06:56 PM] Justin: and btw those poor white kids, dont have it fucken easy either in terms of class mobility
[5/1/17, 1:07:35 PM] Launchpad: White privilege is a term that is divisive.  Were not going to all come around the campfire and sing 'kumbayee white privilege'
[5/1/17, 1:07:50 PM] Justin: ok class warfare?
[5/1/17, 1:07:53 PM] Justin: devisive?
[5/1/17, 1:08:18 PM] Justin: why do you focus so much on a name?
[5/1/17, 1:08:32 PM] Justin: i thoguht thats liberal snowflakes that do that
[5/1/17, 1:09:59 PM] Justin: not only do i not find words divisive, but i also question why it matters is something is "divisive"
[5/1/17, 1:10:13 PM] Launchpad: Why do you continue to insist on using it? Hey retard, sure you may have down syndrome.  But you're actually retarded so you shouldn't have a problem with me calling you that, downyface
[5/1/17, 1:10:31 PM] Justin: you act like you cna be " won over" if they didnt use the word white, clearly thats bullshit
[5/1/17, 1:10:47 PM] Justin: once again, wrong tree to bark up lol
[5/1/17, 1:11:32 PM] Justin: in as anti steve a way as possible- " i really dont care"
[5/1/17, 1:11:55 PM] Justin: i take offense to alot of shit you say, above paragraph didnt even enrage me in the slightest
[5/1/17, 1:13:05 PM] Justin: better question is, why have you still not figured out what it actually is?
[5/1/17, 1:14:40 PM] Justin: IE. native americans make up less than 1% of americans, they are overwhelmingly poor and drug abusers, but drug use is much higher overall in white america.  Does that imply native Americans aren't overwhelmingly poor and drug users?
[5/1/17, 1:17:33 PM] Launchpad: better question is...what are you actually going to do about it other than repeat 'white privilege' any chance you get
[5/1/17, 1:18:57 PM] Justin: idk what are you doing about changing the perception of employment practices when it comes to women?
[5/1/17, 1:19:38 PM] Launchpad: lol nothing
[5/1/17, 1:19:54 PM] Launchpad: Im not doing the hiring
[5/1/17, 1:20:06 PM] Justin: well why yuo post the article to discuss weeks ago?
[5/1/17, 1:20:18 PM] Justin: you arent doing anything about it
[5/1/17, 1:20:24 PM] Justin: what you gonna do about the fier festival
[5/1/17, 1:20:35 PM] Launchpad: laugh about it
[5/1/17, 1:20:40 PM] Justin: what you gonna do about insert any random thing you put into a chat thread
[5/1/17, 1:20:45 PM] Launchpad: cause Im bored and this is mildly entertaining
[5/1/17, 1:20:46 PM] Justin: solaughing about soemthing implies action?
[5/1/17, 1:21:21 PM] Justin: which is the point
[5/1/17, 1:22:11 PM] Justin: so you commented that the post was mental masturbation- thus provoking the discussion, thus bringing in entertainment
[5/1/17, 1:22:18 PM] Launchpad: I never said Im here to take action --> My role is to do what I think is best, not to preach to others (except in group chat for entertainment purposes)
[5/1/17, 1:22:23 PM] Justin: action isnt an implication of discussion
[5/1/17, 1:22:28 PM] Justin: when did i say im here to take action
[5/1/17, 1:23:47 PM] Justin: it seems your answer is disagree as long as you can, then say ok what you gonna do about it...then say i choose to focus on things i can do something about...which is clearly untrue as we have just discovered
[5/1/17, 1:23:51 PM] Launchpad: I guess you didn't
[5/1/17, 1:24:33 PM] Justin: that we can agree on
[5/1/17, 1:24:41 PM] Justin: boom another one for the records
[5/1/17, 1:25:24 PM] Justin: sniipped it for you
[5/1/17, 1:25:35 PM] Justin: teamwork
[5/1/17, 1:25:54 PM] Launchpad: However, your use of the term 'white privilege' is offensive, just like retard or tranny
[5/1/17, 1:25:59 PM] Launchpad: use it all you want
[5/1/17, 1:26:15 PM] Launchpad: Ill continue to roll my eyes when I hear it
[5/1/17, 1:26:36 PM] Justin: yeh im crying for you
[5/1/17, 1:28:42 PM] Justin: you are also correct, there are no implications of the fact that up until 50 years ago blacks were treated as 2nd class citizens, lynched in half this country, and werent allowed to vote.  there is much more implication for using the word white in describing these conditions
[5/1/17, 1:29:40 PM] Justin: there is no implication that white americans use drugs as often if not more than black americans, yet black americans make up 80% of drug convictions
[5/1/17, 1:30:54 PM] Launchpad: yes and 75 years ago my family was systematically murdered by nazis
[5/1/17, 1:32:14 PM] Justin: funny did you or any of your friends end up in jail after that for smoking weed in high school?
[5/1/17, 1:32:15 PM] Launchpad: white privilege or black tax?
[5/1/17, 1:32:31 PM] Justin: what you mean by black tax?
[5/1/17, 1:33:15 PM] Justin: were your grandparents treated as property for 300 years?
[5/1/17, 1:33:22 PM] Launchpad: you must have skipped that article when I posted it
[5/1/17, 1:33:40 PM] Justin: presumably was when i wasnt in the chat
[5/1/17, 1:33:58 PM] Launchpad: lol I don't know
[5/1/17, 1:34:21 PM] Justin: and idk why im comparring jewish holocaust victems to black americans- that comparison misses the whole point
[5/1/17, 1:35:16 PM] Justin: the point is we have a difference in outcome- its there, so we need to ask why is it there.  PErhaps there are other good answers, however, you getting upset over someone using the word white and comparing it to discrimination isnt one of those good answers
[5/1/17, 1:35:35 PM] Kiyoon: Could you guys have a separate Herman Vs. Scottie Whatsapp chat
[5/1/17, 1:35:49 PM] Justin: im ending it there
[5/1/17, 1:35:48 PM] Kiyoon: you two aren't gonna agree on anything so can we stop spamming
[5/1/17, 1:36:12 PM] Justin: more importantly gotta figure out new workout program
[5/1/17, 1:36:24 PM] Kiyoon: what are you DL nowadays Herm
[5/1/17, 1:36:28 PM] Justin: thinkign about doign 531

[5/1/17, 1:37:04 PM] Miller: ive done both
[5/1/17, 1:37:06 PM] Justin: havent tested it in months- presumably 520
[5/1/17, 1:37:10 PM] Miller: i recommend the former
[5/1/17, 1:37:17 PM] Justin: did you like 531?
[5/1/17, 1:37:23 PM] Miller: i did
[5/1/17, 1:37:26 PM] Miller: i have the ebook if you want
[5/1/17, 1:37:52 PM] Justin: yeh send it over..just seems like a relaly simplied program and has alot of testing presumably
[5/1/17, 1:40:09 PM] Miller: apparently there was actually a good heavyweight boxing fight this weekend, first time in a decade or so
[5/1/17, 1:42:48 PM] Justin: that the jist of 531?
[5/1/17, 1:43:02 PM] Justin: why is the 1 at 95% and not new pr?
[5/1/17, 1:43:25 PM] Miller: idk what im looking at
[5/1/17, 1:43:29 PM] Miller: also been years so idk
[5/1/17, 1:44:41 PM] Launchpad: Agreed on 2 things today üòÇ
[5/1/17, 1:45:00 PM] Launchpad: side note, Bitcoin is crushing it today
[5/1/17, 1:45:13 PM] Launchpad: yet all I feel is sadness for not owning Etherium
[5/1/17, 1:48:04 PM] Miller: http://www.thewrap.com/mark-geragos-files-100-million-lawsuit-against-fyre-fest-ja-rule/ missed out guys, i handed this one to you on a platter
[5/1/17, 1:48:45 PM] Launchpad: just saw that
[5/1/17, 1:48:59 PM] Launchpad: they are done as a company - this is unrecoverable
[5/1/17, 1:49:35 PM] Launchpad: even if they recovered financially, their reputation is destroyed and no one could ever take that company seriously
[5/1/17, 1:49:45 PM] Miller: #rebrand
[5/1/17, 1:50:41 PM] Launchpad: lol true -- Ive seen it happen
[5/1/17, 1:50:53 PM] Launchpad: but his was truly a fuckup of epic proportions
[5/1/17, 1:52:57 PM] Launchpad: Exhibit A: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS.ac,_Inc.
[5/1/17, 2:55:05 PM] Miller: @13478047760
[5/1/17, 2:55:23 PM] Miller: if anyone else wants to come going out after work friday (cinco de mayo) for tacos/margaritas
[5/1/17, 2:55:55 PM] Steve: I am purposely not going when you troll
[5/1/17, 2:56:04 PM] Steve: So, I'm out p
[5/1/17, 2:56:35 PM] Launchpad: btw, Drunk Steve calling everyone out Friday night was pretty hilarious
[5/1/17, 2:57:04 PM] Donk: Asking miller not to troll is like asking a fish not to swim
[5/1/17, 2:57:05 PM] Steve: Did you enjoy my free shmoke breakdown too?
[5/1/17, 2:57:08 PM] Steve: Or too much?
[5/1/17, 2:58:03 PM] Launchpad: dont remember that part
[5/1/17, 2:58:17 PM] Launchpad: but I did like the calling out by name 1 at a time
[5/1/17, 2:58:36 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/1/17, 2:59:55 PM] Miller: its not really trolling, what happens is i invite the group as a whole to things, steve ignores/doesnt see it then later laments the fact i did not invite him so i am just going out of my way to make sure he knows everything he is invited to
[5/1/17, 3:13:33 PM] Donk: That invite was def a troll,  albeit a hilarious one
[5/1/17, 3:16:09 PM] Donk: Hmm, fair
[5/1/17, 3:16:29 PM] Donk: Though id argue a wider definition of trolling would include this type of joke
[5/1/17, 3:16:55 PM] Miller: counter point i would argue most people here dont use that word correctly
[5/1/17, 3:17:53 PM] Donk: That could also be true
[5/1/17, 3:19:40 PM] Steve: You def were trolling
[5/1/17, 3:19:47 PM] Steve: But the fact that it got a laugh was a plus
[5/1/17, 3:20:10 PM] Steve: Your original attempt was to anger me
[5/1/17, 3:20:27 PM] Miller: it was not
[5/1/17, 3:20:32 PM] Steve: Right
[5/1/17, 3:21:04 PM] Miller: sure, you would know better
[5/1/17, 3:29:39 PM] Dan Watts: @13478047760 i'm going to tacos 5/5 too so you know it gone be lit üî•
[5/1/17, 3:30:07 PM] Steve: I'm passing
[5/1/17, 3:30:51 PM] Dan Watts: passing or failing?
[5/1/17, 3:31:34 PM] Donk: On a side note,  going for tacos and margaritas on cinco de mayo sounds horribly crowded
[5/1/17, 3:31:39 PM] Steve: Passing on tacos and margaritas
[5/1/17, 3:31:49 PM] Donk: That's the one day not to do that imo
[5/1/17, 3:32:07 PM] Launchpad: like ordering take-out on 4:20
[5/1/17, 3:32:09 PM] Launchpad: bad idea
[5/1/17, 3:32:22 PM] Donk: Haha
[5/1/17, 3:32:31 PM] Launchpad: however, tacos and margaritas are always a good idea, no matter what
[5/1/17, 3:32:48 PM] Miller: i dont disagree but ive been wanting to go, its a friday, and gonna get there early
[5/1/17, 3:33:04 PM] Miller: i would have been just as happy going if this friday was 5/6 or 5/4
[5/1/17, 3:33:11 PM] Dan Watts: i can't think of a better way to stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters south of the border than to support their business on cinco de mayo
[5/1/17, 3:33:23 PM] Dan Watts: you guys just aren't #woke
[5/1/17, 3:34:08 PM] Launchpad: If you REALLY want to help you must first denounce your white privilege
[5/1/17, 3:34:51 PM] Launchpad: then take your dollars to Hong Kong
[5/1/17, 3:37:23 PM] Dan Watts: there's real fear if i put on a sombrero i'll be accused of cultural appropriation but i'm willing to take the chance
[5/1/17, 3:38:30 PM] Donk: Depends how woke the tacos are

[5/1/17, 4:20:57 PM] Miller: hes also 2 years younger
[5/1/17, 4:21:06 PM] Miller: kind of a big deal at that age in terms of height
[5/1/17, 4:22:04 PM] Donk: Maybe the hiltons are the reverse el duque/miguel tejadas and lie about being older rather than younger
[5/1/17, 4:22:33 PM] Miller: chinese gymnast style

[5/2/17, 5:41:45 PM] Miller: these will never make any sense to me
[5/2/17, 5:42:13 PM] Steve: Every time I see that it brings back the memory of what could have been against UConn
[5/2/17, 5:42:25 PM] Steve: Which was the opposite, but still
[5/2/17, 5:46:01 PM] Dan Watts: crazy thing is you can't get +10,000 on any other team in the field
[5/2/17, 5:49:18 PM] Steve: Makes sense
[5/2/17, 5:49:22 PM] Steve: All teams left are good

[5/3/17, 11:00:59 AM] Justin: Pretty disappointed by the trailer
[5/3/17, 11:01:35 AM] Justin: Never read the books but seemed like would be a cool movie/ it's got good cast
[5/3/17, 11:01:57 AM] Steve: If you are into 89 year olds
[5/3/17, 11:02:09 AM] Steve: Which you seem to be
[5/3/17, 11:10:32 AM] Justin: so kiyoon followed me on quora(didnt even know i had an official account), so that triggered me to look at LP quora and now im wondering if whatsapp LP is just one giant troll.
[5/3/17, 11:11:52 AM] Launchpad: basically lol
[5/3/17, 11:11:56 AM] Justin: lol
[5/3/17, 11:12:09 AM] Justin: seriously though LP wtf completely reasoned and no mention of being awesome
[5/3/17, 11:12:19 AM] Launchpad: they definitely want to cum
[5/3/17, 11:13:10 AM] Launchpad: lol
[5/3/17, 11:13:33 AM] Justin: yeh you the hilary clinton of quora
[5/3/17, 11:14:20 AM] Launchpad: Welcome to Quora, Kiyoon
[5/3/17, 11:15:35 AM] Kiyoon: I clicked on a link and it happened to be quora
[5/3/17, 11:15:47 AM] Kiyoon: I have no idea how I followed people I thought I clicked unfollow all
[5/3/17, 11:16:28 AM] Launchpad: just shut up and start adding topics
[5/3/17, 11:18:56 AM] Donk: Ive read the books
[5/3/17, 11:19:14 AM] Donk: The issue is that the first book is awful, so wasnt expecting much from the trailer
[5/3/17, 11:19:33 AM] Justin: doesnt feel at all stephen kingy, thoguht cool part was it links all his books
[5/3/17, 11:20:01 AM] Donk: It does, but it always seemed forced to me
[5/3/17, 11:20:14 AM] Donk: The best book in the series is the 4th one
[5/3/17, 11:20:24 AM] Donk: My 2nd fav king book behind the stand
[5/3/17, 11:20:36 AM] Launchpad: that sucks you need to make it through an entire shitty book before it gets good
[5/3/17, 11:21:38 AM] Justin: and isnt the mcconaughey character suppoed to be guy form the stand>/
[5/3/17, 11:23:05 AM] Donk: Agreed, its why i picked it up 3 or 4 times over the years before finally getting through it
[5/3/17, 11:23:06 AM] Donk: 2, 3, 4 and 5 are all good
[5/3/17, 11:23:15 AM] Donk: 6 and 7 are eh, ans im not a fan of the ending
[5/3/17, 11:24:35 AM] Donk: Yes and no
[5/3/17, 11:24:36 AM] Donk: Or more no and yes
[5/3/17, 11:24:37 AM] Donk: It also looks like they have changed a bunch of stuff,  which they almost had to in order to adopt the first book into a movie
[5/3/17, 11:25:25 AM] Launchpad: anybody watch the new 24 / Prison Break?
[5/3/17, 11:25:36 AM] Justin: y
[5/3/17, 11:25:52 AM] Justin: didnt like 24 was the new model of only 12 episdoes
[5/3/17, 11:25:53 AM] Launchpad: Prison Break == Fucken Awesome, 24 == ok
[5/3/17, 11:26:13 AM] Justin: idk i caught up on prison breka all at once and i feel a little lost
[5/3/17, 11:26:43 AM] Justin: dont remember alot of the plot they are following up on...never saw the movie adn wonder if thats why
[5/3/17, 11:26:52 AM] Launchpad: its better that way because they've already beaten this show to death and continuously re-use the same tricks
[5/3/17, 11:27:22 AM] Justin: idk old 24 seasons would have like 3 different storylines per season
[5/3/17, 11:27:33 AM] Justin: like it would never be over when it was over
[5/3/17, 11:27:56 AM] Justin: always a deeper layer...didnt feel this had much of a deeper layer
[5/3/17, 11:28:29 AM] Justin: ending melodramatic and blah also
[5/3/17, 11:28:40 AM] Justin: could really care less who lived and died
[5/3/17, 11:28:43 AM] Launchpad: yeah but the new one you kind of want to be over, because how many times are they going to keep kidnapping the significant other of character to manipulate them into doing something / releasing terrorist
[5/3/17, 11:29:05 AM] Launchpad: I am actually on the last episode of 24 so no spoilers
[5/3/17, 11:29:13 AM] Justin: yeh i woudlnt spoil just in case
[5/3/17, 11:29:51 AM] Justin: jack dies fyi
[5/3/17, 11:30:00 AM] Justin: and then he comes back as a lost boy
[5/3/17, 11:30:03 AM] Launchpad: lol
[5/3/17, 11:30:30 AM] Launchpad: have you been watching Designated Survivor?
[5/3/17, 11:30:44 AM] Justin: not caught up, couple episodes back
[5/3/17, 11:30:47 AM] Justin: I like it
[5/3/17, 11:31:03 AM] Justin: show i really like which porbably got the boot was actually braindead
[5/3/17, 11:31:42 AM] Justin: invasion of bodysnatcher/trumps world combo
[5/3/17, 11:31:47 AM] Launchpad: I've only seen 2 episodes of DS, so Im way behind
[5/3/17, 11:32:05 AM] Justin: its good, pretty dramatic, very 24ish
[5/3/17, 11:32:43 AM] Launchpad: now that I have a gf and work from home 2 days a week, I've been catching up on all the Netflix I've been missing out
[5/3/17, 11:33:11 AM] Justin: currently watching season 2 of legends of tomorrow
[5/3/17, 11:33:24 AM] Justin: connected to whole flash/arrow universe
[5/3/17, 11:33:39 AM] Launchpad: im also watching Iron Fist
[5/3/17, 11:33:45 AM] Justin: havent watched that yet
[5/3/17, 11:33:47 AM] Launchpad: connected to netflix marvel universe
[5/3/17, 11:34:24 AM] Justin: yeh got such shitty ratings i skuipped it
[5/3/17, 11:34:48 AM] Miller: cant wait to hear launchpads hot taek on the whitewashing outcry
[5/3/17, 11:36:02 AM] Launchpad: Enlighten me
[5/3/17, 11:36:53 AM] Steve: Apparently healthcare vote might be close
[5/3/17, 11:36:59 AM] Steve: Great
[5/3/17, 11:36:59 AM] Miller: shocked you did not hear about this
[5/3/17, 11:37:14 AM] Miller: gonna get re-written in the senate
[5/3/17, 11:37:54 AM] Miller: amazing it took them this long to get a bill together that can pass the house, doesnt bode well for the ultimate success for it
[5/3/17, 11:38:44 AM] Steve: It's going to be horrendous for us
[5/3/17, 11:38:51 AM] Steve: Well for people like me
[5/3/17, 11:38:54 AM] Steve: Great
[5/3/17, 11:39:05 AM] Miller: its not becoming a law
[5/3/17, 11:39:06 AM] Miller: relax
[5/3/17, 11:45:16 AM] Justin: well quite frankly it wont be horrendous for you
[5/3/17, 11:45:43 AM] Justin: just saying, its likely a net positive for you
[5/3/17, 11:46:19 AM] Justin: although that depends on what NY does as techincally speaking the state mandates coverage of preexisting condtions
[5/3/17, 11:47:30 AM] Steve: Why would be a net positive for me?
[5/3/17, 11:47:43 AM] Justin: well if you lived in most other states net positive
[5/3/17, 11:48:01 AM] Justin: presumbaly your income level doesnt allow you to receive almost any subsidies
[5/3/17, 11:48:09 AM] Justin: so you get no help currently form federal government
[5/3/17, 11:48:24 AM] Justin: and you are paying to subsidize olde rpeople in your premium pricing
[5/3/17, 11:48:57 AM] Steve: I'm also paying to subsidize people with preexisting conditions
[5/3/17, 11:49:00 AM] Justin: and as far as i know you have no pre existing conditions
[5/3/17, 11:49:03 AM] Steve: And poorer people
[5/3/17, 11:49:21 AM] Justin: yeh exactly, so technically its a net positive
[5/3/17, 11:49:25 AM] Steve: And if I get one?
[5/3/17, 11:49:37 AM] Justin: im not saying its a good thing for the system overall, just net positive for you in theory
[5/3/17, 11:49:36 AM] Steve: And I live to not just worry about myself
[5/3/17, 11:49:52 AM] Steve: It's not just about that
[5/3/17, 11:50:06 AM] Dan Watts: #moralsteve
[5/3/17, 11:50:57 AM] Steve: It's about being human
[5/3/17, 11:51:00 AM] Steve: But sure
[5/3/17, 11:51:07 AM] Justin: well then lets get some universal healthcare going
[5/3/17, 11:51:12 AM] Justin: cuase this system is shit
[5/3/17, 11:51:47 AM] Justin: as evidenced by the inability of republicans to sway moderate and right wingers.... its squarely a right wing healthcare plan
[5/3/17, 11:52:05 AM] Justin: that they branded as socialism
[5/3/17, 11:52:33 AM] Steve: Which is basically telling the elderly, poor and sick to just die
[5/3/17, 11:55:16 AM] Launchpad: I am now up to date.  Verdict? Stupid
[5/3/17, 11:55:32 AM] Launchpad: especially considering the original Danny Rand from the comic book was a white dude
[5/3/17, 11:56:43 AM] Dan Watts: actually the poorest and the elderly are covered by medicaid/medicare
[5/3/17, 11:56:50 AM] Dan Watts: everyone else gets fucked
[5/3/17, 11:56:59 AM] Miller: Totally agree
[5/3/17, 11:57:00 AM] Justin: well alot of them wouldnt be after this bill
[5/3/17, 11:57:07 AM] Justin: assuming it rolls back medicaide expansion
[5/3/17, 11:57:10 AM] Miller: Whole stupid controversy was dumb
[5/3/17, 11:57:56 AM] Justin: also this would destroy medicaide w block grants in next ten years so there is that
[5/3/17, 11:58:06 AM] Miller: Once again this current bill is DOA in the Senate
[5/3/17, 11:58:15 AM] Justin: but yeh overall i agree with watts statement that poorest and oldest have universal healthcare
[5/3/17, 11:58:53 AM] Steve: Paul Ryan is def looking to dismantle Medicare and Medicare
[5/3/17, 11:59:00 AM] Steve: Whether he does it slowly or not
[5/3/17, 11:59:12 AM] Justin: essentially the government pays for the highest risk pools, does it fine, yet noone wants universal healthcare
[5/3/17, 11:59:16 AM] Steve: If you believe that won't happen, you might want to lift up the rock you're living under
[5/3/17, 12:00:14 PM] Justin: yeh the block grants will massively under fund medicaid and destroy it
[5/3/17, 12:00:18 PM] Justin: no argument here
[5/3/17, 12:12:43 PM] Steve: https://youtu.be/uX1n4EGzqS4
[5/3/17, 12:27:17 PM] Justin: spinoff greenlit by fox
[5/3/17, 12:36:57 PM] Launchpad: want to hear some annoying shit? Yesterday, FB Messenger app went haywire and used 4.9GB of data -- half of my data on the first day of the month
[5/3/17, 12:37:10 PM] Steve: Comey to senate "won't say a word about trump probe until it's done"
[5/3/17, 12:37:20 PM] Steve: Wish he was that fair with every investigation
[5/3/17, 12:37:38 PM] Steve: Why do you not have unlimited data?
[5/3/17, 12:37:40 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/3/17, 12:37:52 PM] Steve: Stuck in 2016?
[5/3/17, 12:37:56 PM] Dan Watts: @16102201963 #classaction
[5/3/17, 12:38:13 PM] Steve: They'd throw it out on grounds of being cheap
[5/3/17, 12:38:26 PM] Dan Watts: Schechter v. Facebook
[5/3/17, 12:38:35 PM] Steve: Even Verizon has unlimited data now
[5/3/17, 12:38:39 PM] Launchpad: Verizon doesn't have unlimited data
[5/3/17, 12:38:39 PM] Steve: #nowxcuses
[5/3/17, 12:38:44 PM] Steve: Yes they do
[5/3/17, 12:38:52 PM] Launchpad: well fuck I just switched my plan a few months ago
[5/3/17, 12:38:59 PM] Steve: You can add it
[5/3/17, 12:40:03 PM] Launchpad: knowing that I'm 'too cheap' -- whats a reasonable amount of money to be spending on a cell phone bill each month
[5/3/17, 12:40:19 PM] Steve: Depends on what you are paying for
[5/3/17, 12:41:09 PM] Steve: Unlimited data, texting and the bare minimum for phone calls (450 minutes or so) I'd say between 100-120 after taxes and such.
[5/3/17, 12:41:12 PM] Steve: IMO
[5/3/17, 12:41:34 PM] Steve: I pay for my phone every month so it's 131
[5/3/17, 12:41:46 PM] Steve: T-Mobile does a payment plan instead of contracts
[5/3/17, 12:41:55 PM] Steve: So after two wars I own the phone and can sell it
[5/3/17, 12:48:47 PM] Launchpad: I just upgraded to unlimited data for an extra $.60 a month
[5/3/17, 12:48:53 PM] Launchpad: Get your screen shot ready
[5/3/17, 12:48:58 PM] Launchpad: Thanks Steve
[5/3/17, 12:49:07 PM] Steve: Of course
[5/3/17, 12:49:20 PM] Steve: Figured an IT guy like yourself would have known hat
[5/3/17, 12:49:50 PM] Miller: Can't use corporate discount with the unlimited plan fyi
[5/3/17, 12:49:51 PM] Launchpad: I literally upgrade my plan a few months ago when I bought my new phone
[5/3/17, 12:50:08 PM] Steve: It happened in the last 4-6 weeks
[5/3/17, 12:50:14 PM] Steve: Big deal all over social media
[5/3/17, 12:50:25 PM] Miller: Yea no idea how he missed that
[5/3/17, 12:51:01 PM] Launchpad: my corporate discount was with my company from 3 years ago, so they were probably going to want me to reverify soon anyway
[5/3/17, 12:51:06 PM] Steve: lol probably wrong use
[5/3/17, 12:51:58 PM] Miller: I'm shocked they let you keep it this long
[5/3/17, 12:52:05 PM] Launchpad: they must have been getting hurt by Sprint, because the 8GB plan I signed up for was also 'New'
[5/3/17, 12:52:10 PM] Miller: They ask Nicole to verify ours every year or so
[5/3/17, 12:52:51 PM] Launchpad: my company before that one was about 20-25% discount -- I kept that a few years but the company after went down to 8%
[5/3/17, 12:53:07 PM] Steve: They were getting hurt by everyone
[5/3/17, 12:53:14 PM] Steve: Literally everyone else has unlimited data
[5/3/17, 12:53:21 PM] Launchpad: and now with 0% discount Im still paying only $.60 more
[5/3/17, 12:53:29 PM] Steve: Def worth t
[5/3/17, 12:53:44 PM] Launchpad: it makes sense as bandwidth is always getting cheaper
[5/3/17, 12:53:54 PM] Steve: I think it was $10 extra a month but it's worth it because I stream millertunes
[5/3/17, 12:54:05 PM] Miller: Weird it's 65 for you it's supposed to be 80
[5/3/17, 12:54:37 PM] Miller: Didn't make sense for me, I don't come close to using my 12gb and would cost me like 60 bucks more a month
[5/3/17, 12:55:00 PM] Steve: Yea
[5/3/17, 12:55:07 PM] Steve: You def have to see if it's worth it
[5/3/17, 12:55:12 PM] Steve: But I stream too much music
[5/3/17, 12:55:19 PM] Steve: Eats it up in 1/2 a month
[5/3/17, 12:56:14 PM] Launchpad: Im constantly surrounded by flakey wi-fi so Ill turn it off to get a better signal and forget to turn it back on
[5/3/17, 12:56:30 PM] Launchpad: like if Im taking a shit at work, the bathroom is at the edge of guest network access
[5/3/17, 12:57:25 PM] Miller: I dont stream any music, have it all cached me outside
[5/3/17, 12:57:51 PM] Kiyoon: spotify fam
[5/3/17, 12:58:23 PM] Steve: Spotify doesn't use data?
[5/3/17, 12:58:26 PM] Steve: Thought it did
[5/3/17, 12:58:32 PM] Launchpad: ill ocassionally stream music from youtube cause Im weird like that
[5/3/17, 12:58:51 PM] Steve: Same
[5/3/17, 12:58:53 PM] Miller: Stream music from the one place you can't even listen without your phone on

[5/3/17, 1:10:22 PM] Dan Watts: thank you, i can't read enough about this disaster
[5/3/17, 1:10:57 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/3/17, 1:11:04 PM] Steve: He probably thinks he paid you out
[5/3/17, 1:11:21 PM] Steve: He did the same to me on my bet with jstew last year
[5/3/17, 1:11:21 PM] Miller: He probably thinks he will buy me a beer in Austin
[5/3/17, 1:11:24 PM] Launchpad: whats amazing is that the founder is promising that they will fix their mistakes for next years festival
[5/3/17, 1:11:39 PM] Launchpad: 0.001% chance there is a Fyre festival next year
[5/3/17, 1:12:04 PM] Steve: 100% he believes he paid already
[5/3/17, 1:12:30 PM] Miller: I mean he told me to bill him and left
[5/3/17, 1:12:37 PM] Miller: Idk how there could be any confusion
[5/3/17, 1:12:52 PM] Donk: He still owes me from a bet from last season
[5/3/17, 1:13:06 PM] Donk: I need to hire watts to sue for collection
[5/3/17, 1:13:26 PM] Miller: I'll join
[5/3/17, 1:13:35 PM] Donk: Class action
[5/3/17, 1:13:37 PM] Steve: It's cheese, really?
[5/3/17, 1:14:03 PM] Steve: He'll probably ask you for proof which will be very easy to show
[5/3/17, 1:14:24 PM] Kiyoon: Did the same to me on our football bet
[5/3/17, 1:14:30 PM] Dan Watts: I've got you
[5/3/17, 1:14:35 PM] Kiyoon: Hounded him down for 2 weeks
[5/3/17, 1:14:47 PM] Donk: Damn, cheese owes money all over town
[5/3/17, 1:14:54 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/3/17, 1:15:08 PM] Steve: Now he'll use the "divorce" excuse
[5/3/17, 1:15:08 PM] Miller: Cheese finna be the new Martin
[5/3/17, 1:15:10 PM] Dan Watts: give the guy a break, kara is shaking him down in this divorce
[5/3/17, 1:15:15 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/3/17, 1:15:18 PM] Steve: Or watts will
[5/3/17, 1:15:29 PM] Steve: That shit is over
[5/3/17, 1:15:41 PM] Steve: The guy even invited me out for celebratory drinks
[5/3/17, 1:17:40 PM] Donk: Liz this morning asked me what the deal was with "the fry festival". I lol'd.
[5/3/17, 1:18:18 PM] Donk: Which led me to telling her sbiut the fry debate, almost had to leave her when she agreed with steve that a tater tot was a fry
[5/3/17, 1:18:24 PM] Launchpad: did you tell her that tots are included?
[5/3/17, 1:19:15 PM] Steve: Boom
[5/3/17, 1:19:23 PM] Steve: Besides the fact that I actually like liz
[5/3/17, 1:19:30 PM] Steve: I now might actually be in love with her
[5/3/17, 1:19:32 PM] Steve: Sorry Donk
[5/3/17, 1:20:05 PM] Donk: Its proof that no one is perfect
[5/3/17, 1:22:48 PM] Steve: That certainly makes her closer
[5/3/17, 1:23:02 PM] Steve: Made my day
[5/3/17, 2:03:26 PM] Miller: How many followers your kendrick Lamar quotes tumblr got?
[5/3/17, 2:09:31 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/3/17, 2:20:56 PM] Launchpad: Tumblr is for kids to young to use snapchat
[5/3/17, 2:21:01 PM] Launchpad: *too
[5/3/17, 2:21:36 PM] Launchpad: I am however curious what kind of wisdom of Lamars that you're sharing
[5/3/17, 2:31:56 PM] Miller: that was the joke, lamar has no quotables so his would be blank
[5/3/17, 2:49:29 PM] Steve: #cheesehumor
[5/3/17, 2:53:07 PM] Miller: is it?
[5/3/17, 2:56:30 PM] Steve: In terms of falling flat, I would say so
[5/3/17, 2:57:40 PM] Miller: theres a difference b/w not being funny and not being intended for everyone
[5/3/17, 2:57:48 PM] Miller: my kendrick lamar humor is very niche
[5/3/17, 2:58:01 PM] Miller: but i dont have a kendrick lamar chat
[5/3/17, 2:58:03 PM] Miller: so it goes here
[5/3/17, 2:58:35 PM] Steve: Great, you can how and where your joke could have been funny. Fact is, it wasn't.
[5/3/17, 2:58:44 PM] Steve: *define
[5/3/17, 2:59:00 PM] Steve: üé©
[5/3/17, 2:59:30 PM] Miller: as i proved yesterday your opinion on humor is irrelevant
[5/3/17, 2:59:40 PM] Steve: According to you
[5/3/17, 2:59:50 PM] Miller: obviously
[5/3/17, 2:59:51 PM] Steve: But you have crowned yourself the judge of all things
[5/3/17, 2:59:59 PM] Steve: So obviously, it is true
[5/3/17, 3:00:01 PM] Miller: its my opinion
[5/3/17, 3:00:03 PM] Miller: so its true
[5/3/17, 3:00:12 PM] Miller: hmm wonder who i sound like
[5/3/17, 3:00:16 PM] Steve: Well by now we all know that
[5/3/17, 3:00:23 PM] Miller: circular reference
[5/3/17, 3:00:27 PM] Steve: Scott?
[5/3/17, 3:00:43 PM] Steve: Again, your opinion
[5/3/17, 3:01:05 PM] Steve: Funny how you think you don't do that
[5/3/17, 3:01:09 PM] Steve: Lol at that
[5/3/17, 3:01:40 PM] Steve: But you also hunk you are never wrong or confused so I guess it makes sense
[5/3/17, 3:02:20 PM] Miller: you calling me a hunk?
[5/3/17, 3:02:22 PM] Miller: very flattering
[5/3/17, 3:02:45 PM] Steve: I'm calling you trumpesque
[5/3/17, 3:02:57 PM] Steve: Must have autocorrected
[5/3/17, 3:03:12 PM] Miller: you must be calling  alot of people hunks
[5/3/17, 3:03:16 PM] Miller: makes it less special for me
[5/3/17, 3:03:40 PM] Steve: Shouldn't make you feel special
[5/3/17, 3:07:11 PM] Miller: its funny you think me stating my opinions is trumpesque b/c i dont qualify every statement i make as in my opinion....... which nobody does b/c thats stupid and its assumed everything you are saying is your opinion
[5/3/17, 3:07:29 PM] Miller: or should i accuse donk of saying the kendrick album is 5 flame emojis as a fact
[5/3/17, 3:07:40 PM] Miller: or watts is a liar b/c he said the pacers were going to win a game
[5/3/17, 3:07:55 PM] Steve: No, what I'm referring to as trumpesque is you accusing people being a certain way
[5/3/17, 3:08:03 PM] Steve: And you doing the same thing on a daily basis
[5/3/17, 3:08:08 PM] Steve: Like our beloved president
[5/3/17, 3:08:19 PM] Steve: That's trumpesque
[5/3/17, 3:08:20 PM] Miller: sure
[5/3/17, 3:08:22 PM] Miller: good one
[5/3/17, 3:08:24 PM] Miller: you got me
[5/3/17, 3:08:26 PM] Miller: im trump
[5/3/17, 3:08:28 PM] Steve: But you can take a poll and ask the audience
[5/3/17, 3:08:32 PM] Miller: sure
[5/3/17, 3:08:33 PM] Miller: id love to
[5/3/17, 3:08:47 PM] Steve: I'm sure everyone will say you never do that
[5/3/17, 3:08:56 PM] Miller: b/c theyre all on my payroll of course
[5/3/17, 3:09:16 PM] Launchpad: creating Polls would be a nice group chat feature
[5/3/17, 3:09:22 PM] Steve: You could probably afford at least half of us
[5/3/17, 3:10:18 PM] Miller: so i do "something" every day,  not totally clear what it is still, but its something
[5/3/17, 3:10:27 PM] Miller: and i can take a poll to ask everyone to confirm this
[5/3/17, 3:10:30 PM] Miller: but they will say i dont?
[5/3/17, 3:10:37 PM] Miller: could not be more confused
[5/3/17, 3:11:12 PM] Donk: My vote is for sale to highest bidder. Opening price: $20.00 or bobblehead equivalent
[5/3/17, 3:11:23 PM] Steve: You tell us how are opinions are wrong because you know better and we don't and then when we state our opinions you bring up the fact that it is our opinion not fact
[5/3/17, 3:11:27 PM] Steve: See the pattern?
[5/3/17, 3:11:48 PM] Steve: I shouldn't say everyday
[5/3/17, 3:11:54 PM] Miller: can i have some evidence of this?
[5/3/17, 3:11:55 PM] Steve: I'd say that happens most days
[5/3/17, 3:11:56 PM] Miller: should be easy to find
[5/3/17, 3:11:57 PM] Launchpad: Francesa bobblehead
[5/3/17, 3:12:05 PM] Steve: I'm not going through all of our chats
[5/3/17, 3:12:11 PM] Miller: i would love a francesa bobblehead i dont think they make one
[5/3/17, 3:12:12 PM] Steve: But I think you still have both of your thumbs
[5/3/17, 3:12:17 PM] Steve: You can scroll up
[5/3/17, 3:12:44 PM] Steve: Again, you can ask people in the chat if you think I'm wrong
[5/3/17, 3:12:48 PM] Miller: i just did
[5/3/17, 3:12:52 PM] Steve: Very easy to do that
[5/3/17, 3:13:03 PM] Miller: welcome all opinions
[5/3/17, 3:13:07 PM] Miller: or screenshots
[5/3/17, 3:13:11 PM] Miller: im here all day
[5/3/17, 3:13:16 PM] Steve: I'm already on a tater tot high
[5/3/17, 3:13:24 PM] Steve: Can always get higher
[5/3/17, 3:14:06 PM] Miller: well when you get some free time you can inundate me w/the tens of hundreds of instances you must have in the 2-3 years of me doing this
[5/3/17, 3:14:17 PM] Steve: I actually don't today
[5/3/17, 3:14:31 PM] Steve: And by tomorrow I'll probably forget about it
[5/3/17, 3:14:41 PM] Brian Katz: Trouble in paradise guys?
[5/3/17, 3:14:41 PM] Launchpad: lol
[5/3/17, 3:14:43 PM] Steve: So, I'll let other people chime in

[5/3/17, 6:35:27 PM] Brian Katz: That would work lol, I can't believe cera still looks 15 years old
[5/3/17, 7:03:43 PM] Justin: So Stephan's friend a union member and mouth breathing conservative supporter of trump kept telling stephan he's an idiot and no one is coming for unions pensions trump gonna save America....he delivers for them
[5/3/17, 7:04:03 PM] Justin: Anotherone bites the dust
[5/3/17, 7:09:40 PM] Dan Watts: Every white SI middle class union guy I know voted for trump. All think the democrats don't care about them. And they're right. See e.g. The Bernie article @15166335046 posted
[5/3/17, 7:09:54 PM] Justin: yeh i mean i get it, but still
[5/3/17, 7:10:10 PM] Justin: they dont care doesnt mean they will actively go after pensions
[5/3/17, 7:10:19 PM] Dan Watts: Definitely contrary to their interest
[5/3/17, 7:10:31 PM] Justin: yeh its insane
[5/3/17, 7:10:46 PM] Justin: if I was in a union id be angry, but id have voted for hilary evne in NY
[5/3/17, 7:10:55 PM] Dan Watts: And all they see is trump going to factories in the Midwest
[5/3/17, 7:11:13 PM] Justin: yeh but alot of them were likely republican pre trump
[5/3/17, 7:11:40 PM] Justin: but yeh trump definitely spoke to that brand of economic populism...bigly
[5/3/17, 7:12:12 PM] Dan Watts: Correct, but seeing the trump stuff reinforces their misguided notion he cares about their interests
[5/3/17, 7:12:27 PM] Justin: yeh absolutely, too bad Hilary didnt do the same shit lol
[5/3/17, 7:13:03 PM] Justin: thing is its not like those union guys in staten island got it bad, they got it really good in fact
[5/3/17, 7:17:23 PM] Justin: so alot of them presumably are angry about what they're gettign taxed, and few of them have any active political wings in their union worth anything.  But take my dads union I think in the primary they obstained from supporting anyone.  The problem with that, and this is coming from me, is it sends the message that Hilary really isnt looking out for their interests(which she's not).  But come election time they weren't hammering home in my dads words " you fucken idiots, an ape can do your job, wtf do you think is gonna happen when trump gets in office and makes you compete with non union labor".
[5/3/17, 7:22:25 PM] Dan Watts: A bunch make 100k +
[5/3/17, 7:22:33 PM] Dan Watts: Some may get 2 pensions
[5/3/17, 7:23:54 PM] Justin: yeh time to anger launchpad essentially "white privilege", think somehow they deserve 6 figure jobs with 70k retirement pensions becuase they do manual labor
[5/3/17, 7:24:13 PM] Justin: they "earned it"
[5/3/17, 7:25:54 PM] Miller: Union privilege
[5/3/17, 7:26:05 PM] Miller: Herman was born into it
[5/3/17, 7:26:08 PM] Justin: union privilege!!!!!
[5/3/17, 7:26:25 PM] Justin: um please dont use the word union like that
[5/3/17, 7:27:03 PM] Miller: No its cool my wife is in a union
[5/3/17, 7:27:29 PM] Justin: perfect example, years of maternity leave
[5/3/17, 7:29:39 PM] Miller: Eh, unpaid
[5/3/17, 7:29:46 PM] Justin: yeh i left out the paid part
[5/3/17, 7:30:22 PM] Miller: Obviously some benefit to it but minimal
[5/3/17, 7:30:41 PM] Miller: Unless we theoretically could have kept our health care during the leave
[5/3/17, 7:30:46 PM] Miller: That would be worth something
[5/3/17, 7:31:02 PM] Justin: keeps years acquired
[5/3/17, 7:31:05 PM] Miller: Otherwise it's mostly still using the Verizon discount
[5/3/17, 7:31:11 PM] Justin: toward pension and bene
[5/3/17, 7:31:41 PM] Miller: Yea but that would pick back up if she got her job back later
[5/3/17, 7:31:53 PM] Miller: This just saves the work of re applying
[5/3/17, 7:48:24 PM] Launchpad: Wait...i thought you were the one always praising unions and how good they are for workers
[5/3/17, 7:49:12 PM] Launchpad: Personally i don't have any issues with unions. There are good ones and bad ones.  Youre just not going to see them in my industry any time soon
[5/3/17, 7:51:03 PM] Justin: once again missing the point of what white privilege is
[5/3/17, 7:51:22 PM] Justin: we have different outcomes... why do we have different outcomes?
[5/3/17, 7:51:22 PM] Launchpad: Always
[5/3/17, 7:51:48 PM] Justin: becuase unions get laws passed that favor unions
[5/3/17, 7:52:10 PM] Justin: I.E. safety regulations public expenditure mandates
[5/3/17, 7:53:10 PM] Launchpad: Ok I'm definitely missing the point now

[5/3/17, 7:54:57 PM] Justin: why do all these idiots in staten island get paid 100k plus--- answer tehir unions
[5/3/17, 7:55:10 PM] Justin: wrong asnwer they deserve it
[5/3/17, 7:55:13 PM] Justin: or they worked hard
[5/3/17, 7:55:40 PM] Justin: plenty of immigrant non union workers getting paid 1/5th as much working just as hard
[5/3/17, 7:56:54 PM] Miller: Or were they born into unions like our own @16316620763
[5/3/17, 7:57:13 PM] Miller: Nepotism!
[5/3/17, 7:57:23 PM] Justin: actaully alot were
[5/3/17, 7:57:28 PM] Miller: I'm sure
[5/3/17, 7:57:32 PM] Miller: I wasn't being sarcastic
[5/3/17, 7:57:58 PM] Justin: although my fathers union wa sthe first to integreate and emphasize taking in minorities
[5/3/17, 7:58:24 PM] Justin: and even now they have "mandates"
[5/3/17, 7:59:00 PM] Justin: but yeh across the board alot nepitism- but nepitism doesnt make them earn 5x what non union laborer costs
[5/3/17, 8:04:29 PM] Sean: Just out of curiosity. I'm not saying this to be a dick, but who should have the right to make a lot of money?
[5/3/17, 8:13:25 PM] Miller: Oh no http://screenrant.com/its-always-sunny-philadelphia-season-13-2018-1029/
[5/3/17, 8:15:36 PM] Justin: it doesnt matter who i think should have the right.  Id love to say things like doctors and teachers should earn money, however, contrary to what you may think i'm not under any delusion that we have a system in which pay is based on merit or directly linked to hard work.  Im just pointing out that structurally winners and losers are picked through the massive influence of governmental bodies and societal norms
[5/3/17, 8:22:21 PM] Justin: so anotherwords the way we right laws gives certain groups(unions, welathier people, white people) advantages
[5/3/17, 8:22:55 PM] Miller: Don't forget offspring of unions
[5/3/17, 8:23:48 PM] Launchpad: not to mention the most favorite union cafeteria item - unioncorn
[5/3/17, 8:24:18 PM] Launchpad: my industry is mostly merit based
[5/3/17, 8:25:25 PM] Justin: fair
[5/3/17, 8:25:44 PM] Justin: although even you are shielded by trade laws
[5/3/17, 8:25:46 PM] Justin: so theres that
[5/3/17, 8:27:30 PM] Justin: immigration laws
[5/3/17, 8:29:54 PM] Launchpad: I am also protected by the fact that a monkey cannot in fact do my job
[5/3/17, 8:30:05 PM] Launchpad: or an ape
[5/3/17, 8:30:13 PM] Miller: Technically it was a trained monkey
[5/3/17, 8:30:14 PM] Launchpad: the entire marsupial family really
[5/3/17, 8:30:36 PM] Justin: well if you an actual libertarian you cnat truly believe that is the sole reason
[5/3/17, 8:30:40 PM] Launchpad: as long as you fuck like a bonobo you're good üëå
[5/3/17, 8:30:44 PM] Miller: A trained monkey could definitely do my job
[5/3/17, 8:31:00 PM] Launchpad: I guess Im not an ACTUAL libertarian before...we've gone over this already
[5/3/17, 8:31:10 PM] Justin: well elts say financial speculation was outlawed tomorrow, would that effect your job?
[5/3/17, 8:31:14 PM] Miller: I think they actually did that experiment
[5/3/17, 8:31:42 PM] Justin: so clearly the flow of regulation and deregulation picks winners and losers
[5/3/17, 8:31:44 PM] Launchpad: a monkey picking stocks vs a retail investor?
[5/3/17, 8:32:01 PM] Miller: https://www.google.com/amp/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/BD1EC814-1AA5-11E5-B6F2-A022EDF44C62
[5/3/17, 8:32:09 PM] Justin: lets look at financial advisor compensation
[5/3/17, 8:32:08 PM] Miller: I'm ruined!
[5/3/17, 8:32:19 PM] Justin: do you think it goes up or down with trump repealing the laws on disclosure?
[5/3/17, 8:32:46 PM] Miller: You taking about DOL?
[5/3/17, 8:34:45 PM] Justin: idk who was set to enforce it, tlaking about whole jon oliver thing
[5/3/17, 8:35:20 PM] Miller: I'm assuming you're talking about DOL
[5/3/17, 8:35:35 PM] Justin: talking about the fidutial repsonsibilty act thing
[5/3/17, 8:35:48 PM] Miller: Yes same thing
[5/3/17, 8:36:09 PM] Justin: so obviously the wages or total compenstaion of financail advisors will now go up
[5/3/17, 8:36:09 PM] Miller: That's one of those things that sounds great on paper, and for sure the current system isn't perfect, but this was a bad law and would do more harm than good
[5/3/17, 8:36:21 PM] Miller: First off it was never put in place
[5/3/17, 8:36:27 PM] Justin: true
[5/3/17, 8:36:29 PM] Miller: So if anything they would not go down
[5/3/17, 8:36:42 PM] Justin: fair
[5/3/17, 8:36:54 PM] Justin: if it went hrough would it go down?
[5/3/17, 8:37:13 PM] Miller: Possibly, for some sure
[5/3/17, 8:37:36 PM] Miller: So here's the problem, yes people are absolutely being put into the wrong products for them because the commissions are higher
[5/3/17, 8:37:39 PM] Miller: That's obviously bad
[5/3/17, 8:37:53 PM] Miller: The problem is it's a very difficult thing to fix
[5/3/17, 8:38:13 PM] Justin: yeh not really deabting the meirt of the rules
[5/3/17, 8:38:43 PM] Justin: just that they obviously effect compensation
[5/3/17, 8:39:03 PM] Justin: so not allwoing 1 billion immigrants into america effects price of labor
[5/3/17, 8:39:33 PM] Justin: if you dont recgnoize that, than you arent really a true advocate of the "market"
[5/3/17, 8:39:53 PM] Justin: you just convientantly choose when you are and arent a free market fan
[5/3/17, 8:40:25 PM] Miller: I talked to my dad about it (who does this for a living) and he said from his end it's terrible, it's a logistical nightmare and makes actually doing his job nearly impossible. I can say for a fact my dad would never take a dime in commission to put a client of his into something that was not in their best interest, and there are probably a lot of people in the industry who feel the same way, and if they all think it's a bad rule, I'm going to take their word for it.
[5/3/17, 8:40:37 PM] Miller: The problem comes from the enforcement and justification
[5/3/17, 8:40:56 PM] Justin: kidna like most doctors and obamacare
[5/3/17, 8:41:34 PM] Justin: most will say they spend more time coding now becuase all the red tape thann seeing patients
[5/3/17, 8:41:59 PM] Miller: The second problem with the rule is if like you say it does lower compensation for that job to the point it's not economic profitable then they are all going to be replaced by robo advisors
[5/3/17, 8:42:14 PM] Miller: Is that better for the consumers? Hard to say
[5/3/17, 8:42:44 PM] Justin: yeh but im not arguing merits of the effects, just arguing it has an effect
[5/3/17, 8:42:55 PM] Miller: I think financial advisory is a pretty important industry, for people of all economic levels considering most people don't know their 401k from their elbow
[5/3/17, 8:42:56 PM] Justin: but yeh interesting
[5/3/17, 8:43:00 PM] Justin: assume dit was good regualtion
[5/3/17, 8:43:19 PM] Miller: Yea its one of those things where on surface it seems like a complete no brainer
[5/3/17, 8:43:26 PM] Miller: Like how was this not already the law
[5/3/17, 8:43:40 PM] Miller: Obviously you should have a fiduciary responsibility to your clients, we do
[5/3/17, 9:16:15 PM] Launchpad: one of the side effects was that it would prevent companies like TD Ameritrade from provider free investment resources and educational materials
[5/3/17, 9:16:27 PM] Launchpad: since they are also a brokerage
[5/3/17, 9:16:38 PM] Launchpad: **providing
[5/3/17, 9:19:01 PM] Launchpad: and bitcoin has broken $1500
[5/3/17, 9:19:15 PM] Launchpad: 1 BTC worth more than 1 ounce of gold
[5/3/17, 9:21:39 PM] Miller: And both equally useless during the werewolf apocalypse
[5/3/17, 9:22:36 PM] Launchpad: will be just as useful or useless as all other currencies
[5/3/17, 9:23:37 PM] Miller: Except silver
[5/3/17, 9:37:00 PM] Miller: I mean yea I'm sure he's aware of it
[5/3/17, 9:37:06 PM] Miller: Plus it keeps things light
[5/3/17, 9:37:12 PM] Miller: It's all fun and games
[5/3/17, 9:37:16 PM] Miller: Normalizes everything
[5/3/17, 9:47:19 PM] Scott: Judge with another homer
[5/3/17, 9:47:57 PM] Scott: #anotherone
[5/3/17, 9:48:37 PM] Launchpad: probably the same way vegas does it
[5/3/17, 9:49:55 PM] Miller: I would think Vegas has fancy facial recognition technology and a billion cameras
[5/3/17, 9:50:04 PM] Miller: If the oceans movies are to be believed
[5/3/17, 9:50:27 PM] Scott: Yeah I don't see how baseball stadiums do it either
[5/3/17, 9:50:35 PM] Scott: #cheeseskeptik
[5/3/17, 9:51:29 PM] Launchpad: I know I was joking
[5/3/17, 9:51:48 PM] Launchpad: but they absolutely have facial recognition techn
[5/3/17, 9:52:11 PM] Miller: Yea i feel like Vegas actually could do it
[5/3/17, 9:52:20 PM] Launchpad: in the olden days they had to print out your picture and pass it around in a book of faces - a 'facebook' if you will
[5/3/17, 9:53:09 PM] Miller: Yea I've always wondered about the baseball thing because like all those morons who run on the field always get lifetime bans
[5/3/17, 9:53:15 PM] Miller: Probably more symbolic than anything
[5/3/17, 10:32:37 PM] Miller: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/01/upshot/health-care-vote-whip-count-comparison.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0

[5/3/17, 10:32:58 PM] Miller: Gonna be close
[5/4/17, 9:42:06 AM] Launchpad: lol I just saw a former coworker's answer pop up on my Quora feed
[5/4/17, 9:49:28 AM] Dan Watts: Does she know how to banter?
[5/4/17, 9:49:55 AM] Miller: does she fuck with the war?

[5/4/17, 2:35:24 PM] Donk: Top 11 states to be most affected by the prior condition mandate all voted trump....
[5/4/17, 2:35:37 PM] Donk: Removal of the mandate that is
[5/4/17, 2:36:26 PM] Justin: think pre existing condtion smaller issue in those states then medicaide expansion
[5/4/17, 2:36:57 PM] Justin: people dont think about consequences, until you get cancer you dont wnat to apy for preexisting condtions
[5/4/17, 2:36:58 PM] Donk: Im sure its both
[5/4/17, 2:37:11 PM] Donk: But they will alsp be most  effected by it
[5/4/17, 2:37:15 PM] Justin: but people will lose their medicaide
[5/4/17, 2:38:41 PM] Justin: yeh i just wonder with the state of the aca and given limited insurance companies that they already had, how affordable anything was at this point.  But yeh if they did have coverage the new subsidy program is gonna wipe out those savings as well.
[5/4/17, 2:40:49 PM] Justin: preexisting just strikes me as eerily similar to alot of other poor choices people make about their futures.
[5/4/17, 2:41:17 PM] Justin: it wont have an immediate effect until 20 years form now when that 30 year old man gets cancer at 50
[5/4/17, 2:41:58 PM] Justin: than that 50 year old cancer patient will be yelling about why isnt my cancer covered
[5/4/17, 2:46:45 PM] Donk: Its further proof that the only reasonable system is single payer
[5/4/17, 2:46:53 PM] Justin: üëç
[5/4/17, 2:46:59 PM] Donk: Which every other real country has
[5/4/17, 2:47:15 PM] Justin: its relly beyond stupid
[5/4/17, 2:47:15 PM] Donk: But "we are a different.  That couldnt work here"
[5/4/17, 2:47:24 PM] Donk: So dumb
[5/4/17, 2:47:29 PM] Justin: we spend 600 billion on defense spending, wtf are doctors worried about exactly
[5/4/17, 2:47:47 PM] Justin: do tehy think the government really wont gladly waste money on paying them for services?
[5/4/17, 2:48:11 PM] Justin: or at least a public option to comepte against the private insurers
[5/4/17, 2:49:42 PM] Justin: its pretty hilarious: the argument is that the public option would lead to universal healthcare becuase private health insurers can't compete against the public option------but that argument implys that the public option will provide services that are cheaper and better by such a wide margin that it will wipe out the inferior private insurance.  So its essentially admitting single payer is better
[5/4/17, 2:50:54 PM] Justin: thought of the whole death panels nonsense branding----wtf exactly are these high risk pools..... a pool of sick people with premiums skyrocketing through the roof that will prevent sick people form getting coverage but wont effect the healthy premiums elsewhere-----"DEATH POOLS"
[5/4/17, 3:04:16 PM] Dan Watts: i'm down with single payer

[5/4/17, 3:44:26 PM] Launchpad: I was just reading about the guy who killed a squirrel and thought this comment was genius:
"We've found Florida Man's distant cousin: Staten Island Man"
[5/4/17, 3:50:23 PM] Scott: I would watch this.

[5/4/17, 4:49:31 PM] Miller: id love to see those screenshots whenever you get some time
[5/4/17, 4:49:50 PM] Miller: im sure you see the irony in accusing someone of ~wiretapping~ being trump w/o any kind of proof
[5/4/17, 4:50:31 PM] Steve: Your right, I'm making it up. It doesn't exist.
[5/4/17, 4:50:41 PM] Steve: Don't care

[5/4/17, 4:54:38 PM] Dan Watts: get yours for a measly $495
[5/4/17, 4:59:54 PM] Justin: tune into the news to see a dick suckign campaign for a bill that isnt a bill yet
[5/4/17, 5:00:16 PM] Justin: pretty impressive, its like bragging about preseason record, or batting practice homeruns
[5/4/17, 5:05:02 PM] Scott: #butthurt
[5/4/17, 5:07:16 PM] Justin: yeh except its not a bill yet and its a bill that helps me financially...so theres that
[5/4/17, 5:07:53 PM] Justin: still pretty ballsy to dress up a tax cut for .1% that will let hundreds of thousands if not millions of people die as a dicksucking oppurtunity
[5/4/17, 5:08:42 PM] Justin: specifically when you know it will have a beyond uphill battle in the senate

[5/4/17, 6:01:46 PM] Dan Watts: the way he avoid the swing and knocked him out with 1 punch is unbelievable
[5/4/17, 6:01:50 PM] Dan Watts: this could be fake btw
[5/4/17, 6:07:05 PM] Justin: ever see russian dude who kncoked the purse muggers out in a park?
[5/4/17, 6:07:14 PM] Justin: reminds me of that video
[5/4/17, 6:07:21 PM] Miller: Video is older than the Internet
[5/4/17, 6:09:59 PM] Justin: still great video
[5/4/17, 6:10:10 PM] Justin: also feel like tosh needs to find that guy

[5/5/17, 7:54:47 AM] Miller: Kim, meanwhile, ascended the rungs of fame from a sex-tape participant to a full-blown pop icon. Often dismissed as untalented, she is indisputably the most famous female hustler of all time, turning a $51 million profit on the business of personal branding in 2016.

[5/5/17, 11:02:42 AM] Miller: As if you needed another reason to grab a cold one, a new study suggests having a few beers relieves your pain better than popping some over the counter painkillers.
[5/5/17, 11:05:06 AM] Launchpad: better than marijuana?
[5/5/17, 11:09:16 AM] Miller: unclear
[5/5/17, 11:21:49 AM] Launchpad: interesting: http://www.businessinsider.com/best-tacos-in-us-2017-4
[5/5/17, 11:22:42 AM] Launchpad: but this shows that their method is flawed
[5/5/17, 11:22:44 AM] Miller: thank god my taco place is not on there
[5/5/17, 11:24:41 AM] Launchpad: heres the problem with that list - if they are going by yelp stars which I think they are.  People in areas where there isn't much mexican food don't have much to compare to, and as a result its easier to stand out from everyone else
[5/5/17, 11:25:38 AM] Miller: very true
[5/5/17, 11:25:40 AM] Launchpad: but there is not a single San Diego restaurant on this top 50 list - but Hawaii has 2.  Do you really think that the tacos at Lolo American Kitchen in Stillwater, Minnesota are better than all San Diego tacos?
[5/5/17, 11:25:51 AM] Miller: also fuck yelp
[5/5/17, 11:26:23 AM] Miller: caters to whiny hipsters
[5/5/17, 11:27:47 AM] Launchpad: its funny looking at this list though: Indiana, Massachusettes, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa
[5/5/17, 11:29:57 AM] Launchpad: also interesting enough: http://www.businessinsider.com/best-tacos-in-america-2016-3
[5/5/17, 11:30:38 AM] Launchpad: #influencers
[5/5/17, 11:31:05 AM] Donk: Why couldn't the minnesota tacos be better than places in san diego?
[5/5/17, 11:32:11 AM] Donk: Ranking it by yelp stars is dumb though
[5/5/17, 11:32:29 AM] Launchpad: it could, but do you really think that place, the places, in Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Missoui & Hawaii are ALL better than any San Diego taco
[5/5/17, 11:32:33 AM] Donk: But outside of that, no reason a minny place couldnt have tje best tacos in the country
[5/5/17, 11:33:11 AM] Launchpad: ^^ possible, but I would consider it an outlier
[5/5/17, 11:33:12 AM] Miller: i think its the water
[5/5/17, 11:33:19 AM] Launchpad: lol
[5/5/17, 11:35:32 AM] Donk: I would agree that san diego has many more good taco places than minny would
[5/5/17, 11:35:42 AM] Donk: On average its sure to be higher
[5/5/17, 11:39:48 AM] Launchpad: San Diego probably has the highest density of Mexican restaurants per capita, so you would think it at least has 1 in the top 50
[5/5/17, 11:40:06 AM] Miller: sounds like a lot of people stating opinions as facts
[5/5/17, 11:40:14 AM] Miller: no doubt they will have wrath rained down upon them
[5/5/17, 11:41:01 AM] Donk: I doubt that san diego does actually
[5/5/17, 11:41:39 AM] Launchpad: trollololol
[5/5/17, 11:41:48 AM] Donk: My guess would be that one of texas/new mexico/arizona cities does
[5/5/17, 11:42:42 AM] Launchpad: that could be true
[5/5/17, 11:42:58 AM] Donk: San diego may be too diverse to take tbe title
[5/5/17, 11:44:43 AM] Launchpad: although population 16k vs 1.3 million
[5/5/17, 11:45:43 AM] Donk: Yeah, true, we would need to figure in population
[5/5/17, 11:54:28 AM] Donk: Now i really want tacos for lunch
[5/5/17, 11:54:38 AM] Donk: On the worst day to want them

[5/5/17, 12:39:37 PM] Launchpad: lol nice one
[5/5/17, 12:40:52 PM] Launchpad: But you would be equally outraged if there was a list of 50 best pizza places in the country and 4 were in Utah but none from NYC made the list
[5/5/17, 12:41:31 PM] Miller: were you not remotely outraged? in that case then yes i would be equally outraged
[5/5/17, 12:41:42 PM] Miller: plus im sure that exact list on BI exists with exactly as you said
[5/5/17, 1:15:17 PM] Justin: Someone is about 72 hours behind on the news

[5/8/17, 5:05:13 PM] Steve: No context whatsoever
[5/8/17, 5:05:33 PM] Steve: It might be from 1980
[5/8/17, 5:05:45 PM] Justin: its got the sympol above barcelona
[5/8/17, 5:06:02 PM] Steve: It's not the current symbol

[5/8/17, 5:06:23 PM] Steve: Obviously we aren't in your head
[5/8/17, 5:06:55 PM] Justin: i assume dshe bought and was wearing a fc barcelona shirt
[5/8/17, 5:06:59 PM] Justin: hence font runner
[5/8/17, 5:07:19 PM] Steve: She def got that from 1982
[5/8/17, 5:07:23 PM] Justin: but maybe thats just some kind of barcelona shirt
[5/8/17, 5:07:27 PM] Steve: Umbro isn't even their sponsor anymore
[5/8/17, 5:07:27 PM] Justin: shes in barcelona
[5/8/17, 5:07:33 PM] Steve: It hasn't been in years
[5/8/17, 5:07:41 PM] Steve: So she bought it from a street vendor
[5/8/17, 5:07:54 PM] Steve: Because that is not the kit from at least this decade

[5/8/17, 5:09:51 PM] Steve: Like in a random rooftop

[5/8/17, 5:10:22 PM] Steve: I'm saying she looks like Liam neesons costar who got taken
[5/8/17, 5:10:28 PM] Justin: only fast and furious does dumb shit like that with letters and numbers
[5/8/17, 5:10:42 PM] Steve: Have to agree with Herman on that one
[5/8/17, 5:11:09 PM] Steve: That's Liam neesons "daughter"
[5/8/17, 5:11:25 PM] Miller: that is is his costar who got taken
[5/8/17, 5:12:12 PM] Steve: Well Hermans mother cannot be his daughter
[5/8/17, 5:12:17 PM] Steve: Not a big enough age gap

[5/8/17, 5:12:51 PM] Justin: id say she looks like shes going to play in a poker tournament
[5/8/17, 5:13:02 PM] Justin: shades, mandatory over ear headphones, and sports jersey
[5/8/17, 5:13:02 PM] Steve: Also that
[5/8/17, 5:13:28 PM] Miller: she looks like a tourist
[5/8/17, 5:13:32 PM] Miller: but like a tourist here
[5/8/17, 5:13:39 PM] Miller: like how europeans looks when they come here
[5/8/17, 5:13:43 PM] Steve: lol I just don't get why that rooftop
[5/8/17, 5:13:49 PM] Justin: so shes fitting in

[5/8/17, 5:13:59 PM] Steve: Like on every block
[5/8/17, 5:14:01 PM] Justin: maybe thats there hotel room?
[5/8/17, 5:14:07 PM] Steve: Possibly
[5/8/17, 5:14:11 PM] Miller: i think thats rigiht, in theory if you nail the european tourist look it just means you look european probably
[5/8/17, 5:14:14 PM] Steve: That would be nice actually
[5/8/17, 5:14:22 PM] Steve: But maybe before posting you should have some context
[5/8/17, 5:14:30 PM] Steve: Then it just leaves a lot of questions
[5/8/17, 5:14:56 PM] Justin: i just thoguht it was funny that she was wearing barcelona shirt and liekly had no idea...but then again i might be wrong
[5/8/17, 5:15:09 PM] Steve: She is def wearing a Barcelona shirt

[5/8/17, 5:15:25 PM] Steve: Leave professional soccer to the professionals herm

[5/8/17, 5:16:01 PM] Steve: So maybe play FIFA again?

[5/8/17, 5:16:52 PM] Justin: top 100 in world...with katz as striker
[5/8/17, 5:18:05 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/8/17, 5:18:14 PM] Steve: Only gamers would think that's actually a sport
[5/8/17, 5:18:28 PM] Justin: yeh agreed soccer is weak dicked
[5/8/17, 5:18:56 PM] Steve: Says a guy who hasn't seen his dick since 2004
[5/8/17, 5:19:16 PM] Steve: üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
[5/8/17, 5:19:22 PM] Justin: *2016 and its starting to resurface
[5/8/17, 5:19:43 PM] Steve: That's because joya is tugging on it
[5/8/17, 5:21:13 PM] Justin: sounds painful
[5/8/17, 5:21:55 PM] Steve: A woman tugging on your schmeckler should never be painful
[5/8/17, 5:36:18 PM] Steve: So by that definition you shouldn't use jerk off either
[5/8/17, 5:36:30 PM] Steve: Because jerk means he same thing
[5/8/17, 5:36:38 PM] Steve: *the
[5/8/17, 5:37:14 PM] Steve: You know, the word in front of -off that you did a lot before joya.
[5/8/17, 5:44:46 PM] Brian Katz: My game is more like pirlo now herman, I am a maestro in the mid field, a passing poet
[5/8/17, 5:46:20 PM] Steve: More like washed up old homeless Italian man that a professional team gave a jersey and a contract to
[5/8/17, 5:47:36 PM] Steve: He actually just lives on a boat in the east river and eats opossum
[5/8/17, 5:48:07 PM] Brian Katz: Guys a World Cup champ
[5/8/17, 5:48:25 PM] Brian Katz: Best mid fielder in Italian football history
[5/8/17, 5:48:48 PM] Miller: Is that taco?
[5/8/17, 5:50:01 PM] Scott: you mean gennero gattuso?
[5/8/17, 5:50:02 PM] Steve: Might as well be
[5/8/17, 5:50:09 PM] Steve: He is awful
[5/8/17, 5:50:15 PM] Steve: And has been for about 4 years
[5/8/17, 5:50:20 PM] Steve: Yet he keeps playing
[5/8/17, 5:50:24 PM] Miller: Looks exactly like taco
[5/8/17, 5:50:43 PM] Steve: If taco were a soccer player, he might be better at this point than Pirog
[5/8/17, 5:50:46 PM] Steve: *pirlo
[5/8/17, 6:58:39 PM] Donk: Thats crazy
[5/8/17, 6:58:53 PM] Donk: Never getting through security again

[5/8/17, 9:45:32 PM] Steve: @15166335046 exceeded his votes for the day
[5/9/17, 8:00:01 AM] Steve: Can we talk about how dominant this Yankees team is?
[5/9/17, 8:07:29 AM] Steve: Too early?
[5/9/17, 8:08:42 AM] Scott: They just are. Not much to discuss.
[5/9/17, 8:10:17 AM] Steve: Side note cheese, the chic sitting next to you on the train, üî•üî•üî•
[5/9/17, 8:10:25 AM] Scott: Yeah I know lol
[5/9/17, 8:10:28 AM] Steve: Almost Kendrick Lamar album hot

[5/9/17, 8:10:33 AM] Scott: Blind
[5/9/17, 8:10:40 AM] Steve: Shoutout to @19732079889
[5/9/17, 8:12:09 AM] Steve: Dirty blonde with blue dress and high leather boots
[5/9/17, 8:12:11 AM] Scott: She was very hot
[5/9/17, 8:14:57 AM] Donk: Only half a game up on the o's
[5/9/17, 8:15:40 AM] Steve: I know
[5/9/17, 8:15:52 AM] Steve: And the astros are really good too
[5/9/17, 8:15:59 AM] Steve: AL is stuffed at the top
[5/9/17, 8:16:29 AM] Steve: The orioles were kind of expected to be good though
[5/9/17, 8:17:02 AM] Donk: Our bullpen is a diaster right now
[5/9/17, 8:19:12 AM] Steve: Britton a big blow
[5/9/17, 8:19:27 AM] Steve: We also just played an 18 inning game

[5/9/17, 8:55:29 AM] Scott: Brad Brach has been pretty good
[5/9/17, 8:57:24 AM] Miller: https://www.thescore.com/news/1297605
[5/9/17, 8:58:31 AM] Donk: Getting tillman back should help, he was good the other night in his first start
[5/9/17, 9:00:30 AM] Steve: It's going to be a fun summer
[5/9/17, 10:38:16 AM] Justin: Damnnn solid lineup
[5/9/17, 10:38:57 AM] Donk: Agreed,  and its even deeper than that, you cut off alot
[5/9/17, 10:38:59 AM] Justin: TV on the radio in the "more "
[5/9/17, 10:39:04 AM] Justin: Yeh
[5/9/17, 10:39:46 AM] Donk: Probably one of the best rap lineups of thr festival year
[5/9/17, 10:40:05 AM] Launchpad: Wow this lineup totally crushes 2007
[5/9/17, 10:40:40 AM] Donk: Too many actual instruments for launchpads taste
[5/9/17, 10:40:46 AM] Donk: More iPods!
[5/9/17, 10:41:28 AM] Launchpad: Glad to see Bassnectar on  the docket
[5/9/17, 10:42:09 AM] Donk: It is strange to see a festival lineup with so little edm on it these days
[5/9/17, 10:43:51 AM] Launchpad: Lollapalooza?
[5/9/17, 10:43:58 AM] Launchpad: That still a thing?
[5/9/17, 10:44:24 AM] Kiyoon: Big Gigantic, GTA
[5/9/17, 10:44:29 AM] Kiyoon: pretty solid linup
[5/9/17, 10:44:31 AM] Kiyoon: BIG BOIIII
[5/9/17, 10:44:43 AM] Launchpad: Coachella has a ton of bands, more than edm but they do have a full edm stage
[5/9/17, 10:45:15 AM] Donk: From a percentsge of total acts standpoint i meant, they all have some
[5/9/17, 10:46:18 AM] Donk: This has little compared to others
[5/9/17, 10:46:24 AM] Launchpad: Kind of like they replaced the edm for hip hop for the ny crowd
[5/9/17, 10:47:12 AM] Launchpad: The hip hop should counteract some of those instruments
[5/9/17, 10:47:36 AM] Miller: im guessing jay has an album coming out
[5/9/17, 5:53:21 PM] Steve: Comey fired lol
[5/9/17, 5:54:04 PM] Steve: Guess trump didn't like his testimony
[5/10/17, 7:46:24 AM] Scott: Really? Lol
[5/10/17, 7:50:05 AM] Donk: Wax on cheese off?
[5/10/17, 10:21:11 AM] Launchpad: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-cheapest-thing-youve-seen-a-mega-rich-person-do/answer/Craig-McClarren
[5/10/17, 10:21:21 AM] Launchpad: (it involves a trump)
[5/10/17, 10:56:57 AM] Dan Watts: @16195657200 thats hilarious
[5/10/17, 10:57:08 AM] Dan Watts: i see the most grimey stuff happen at chipotle
[5/10/17, 10:57:28 AM] Dan Watts: people stealing hot sauces, cutlery, etc
[5/10/17, 10:58:06 AM] Donk: I was in one the other day that made you ask for a knife or spoon for that reason im guessing haha
[5/10/17, 10:59:05 AM] Dan Watts: i always wondered if you get a water cup, is it wrong to put seltzer in there?
[5/10/17, 10:59:59 AM] Launchpad: it is wrong because seltzer is fucken gross
[5/10/17, 11:00:46 AM] Dan Watts: i'm a fan
[5/10/17, 11:02:00 AM] Donk: I would say its the same as soda so also "wrong "
[5/10/17, 11:03:19 AM] Dan Watts: but usually the seltzer has one of those small buttons similar to the water
[5/10/17, 11:03:32 AM] Dan Watts: and theres no syrup
[5/10/17, 11:03:42 AM] Dan Watts: so the only difference is the carbonation
[5/10/17, 11:04:33 AM] Donk: I would think that seltzer would qualify as soda
[5/10/17, 11:04:54 AM] Dan Watts: thats @13478047760 logic
[5/10/17, 11:05:08 AM] Donk: Lol, disagree
[5/10/17, 11:05:30 AM] Steve: Keep my name out your mout!
[5/10/17, 11:05:37 AM] Donk: It depends on the definiton of soda
[5/10/17, 11:05:49 AM] Miller: thats actually fascinating debate i had never considered
[5/10/17, 11:06:02 AM] Miller: on one hand yes def "wrong" b/c if you asked for a seltzer they would charge you
[5/10/17, 11:06:11 AM] Miller: but the lack of syrup makes it a victimless crime
[5/10/17, 11:06:17 AM] Justin: Seltzer cost same as soda at supermarket, so there's that
[5/10/17, 11:06:23 AM] Donk: Is soda a non alcholohic carbonate beverage? Or does it need syrup
[5/10/17, 11:06:34 AM] Miller: water also not free
[5/10/17, 11:06:36 AM] Justin: But idk if that's paying for the bottle as opposed to content
[5/10/17, 11:06:44 AM] Miller: and @Donk i think all chipotles now make you ask for cutlery
[5/10/17, 11:06:45 AM] Donk: Technically it does cost the store more since it does need to be carbinated
[5/10/17, 11:08:12 AM] Justin: I thought that meadows thing was at flushing park, it's in the stadium?
[5/10/17, 11:11:04 AM] Miller: no its in the parking lot
[5/10/17, 11:11:31 AM] Dan Watts: i remember EDC NY was in the parking lot, very weird
[5/10/17, 11:13:52 AM] Donk: It sucks standing on concrete all day too vs grass
[5/10/17, 11:17:19 AM] Justin: Damn Baltimore won 6 straight, fuck you donk
[5/10/17, 11:17:47 AM] Donk: Last night was particularly great
[5/10/17, 11:17:59 AM] Donk: Get 2 in bottom of the 9th to tie it up
[5/10/17, 11:18:08 AM] Donk: And then win in the 12th
[5/10/17, 11:18:30 AM] Donk: Would have won in thr 11th had it not been for a great throw from Harper to get hardy at the plate
[5/10/17, 1:22:18 PM] Justin: @13478047760 new cause for you. http://www.salon.com/2017/05/09/with-obamacare-under-gop-attack-new-york-could-fight-back-with-single-payer/
[5/10/17, 1:39:23 PM] Justin: Hahaha
[5/10/17, 1:52:02 PM] Steve: Also, Herman, I wouldn't troll any one picking causes or helping where they can when all you really do is sit behind a desk in jersey city and rant about how awful things are.
[5/10/17, 1:52:43 PM] Steve: I thought we went over this months ago. When you actually do something, then you can say something. If not, I'd appreciate it if you follow watts' lead and keep my name out your mouth.
[5/10/17, 1:52:49 PM] Steve: Put respek on my name
[5/10/17, 1:53:54 PM] Steve: Last point, that news is about a week old.
[5/10/17, 1:54:04 PM] Launchpad: This cause is Herman Approved ‚Ñ¢
[5/10/17, 1:54:08 PM] Steve: Maybe you should be better at the internet first.
[5/10/17, 2:11:34 PM] Justin: Was actually serious
[5/10/17, 2:11:54 PM] Justin: Wasnt trolling, possibly directing
[5/10/17, 2:12:12 PM] Steve: Seemed like a troll
[5/10/17, 2:12:19 PM] Justin: 2 votes away from ny erasing that disaster move by congress
[5/10/17, 2:12:38 PM] Justin: Seems like something you would be interested in
[5/10/17, 2:12:55 PM] Justin: Fair that I could dm you that, but figured everyone should read article
[5/10/17, 2:13:29 PM] Steve: Although I'm not wrong if t was a troll, I apologize for assuming t was
[5/10/17, 2:13:38 PM] Steve: I read about that last week
[5/10/17, 2:13:42 PM] Justin: It's all good understandable
[5/10/17, 2:14:07 PM] Justin: Oh I had no idea they had the dickhead democratic caucus on board
[5/10/17, 2:14:20 PM] Justin: Usually they work with republicans

[5/10/17, 5:21:49 PM] Justin: lol
[5/10/17, 5:23:12 PM] Launchpad: How about instead of not using the word crazy, we refer to actual crazy people in more descriptive terms "Yo that bitch is schizo"
[5/10/17, 5:31:13 PM] Dan Watts: My experience is that people who are crazy don't know it thus they won't be offended
[5/10/17, 5:31:38 PM] Launchpad: or they wear it like a badge of honor
[5/10/17, 5:32:09 PM] Dan Watts: OMFG I'M SO CRAZY

[5/10/17, 7:39:18 PM] Launchpad: 1 car crash last night at midnight - probably drunk
[5/10/17, 7:47:19 PM] Donk: Yeah,  he was dating one of liz's bridesmaids sister too
[5/10/17, 7:48:32 PM] Donk: Apparently he was heading home later and the girlfriend told him to stay at a friends vs driving all the way back
[5/10/17, 7:48:43 PM] Donk: Not drunk according to liz's friend
[5/10/17, 7:49:08 PM] Donk: But who knows
[5/10/17, 7:51:50 PM] Launchpad: My brother said he was a big Rangers fan, so them getting eliminated did not help
[5/10/17, 7:53:41 PM] Launchpad: Which friend of Liz?
[5/10/17, 7:57:57 PM] Donk: Lisa
[5/10/17, 7:58:23 PM] Donk: She went to mahopac hs though

[5/10/17, 8:01:34 PM] Launchpad: have you been to the JV Mall yet?
[5/10/17, 8:01:50 PM] Donk: No, but i heard they are redoing it
[5/10/17, 8:02:18 PM] Donk: Im still way closer to the white plains malls to bother going up there to shop
[5/10/17, 8:02:31 PM] Donk: And work near the palisades mall for that matter
[5/10/17, 8:02:53 PM] Launchpad: jv mall was my old stomping grounds.  Lived a mile away - would walk or ride bikes there as a kid
[5/10/17, 8:03:13 PM] Launchpad: do kids even like malls today?
[5/10/17, 8:03:25 PM] Donk: Jv mall was in an episode of billions first season according to liz

[5/10/17, 8:05:02 PM] Miller: #humblebrag
[5/10/17, 8:05:33 PM] Donk: Yeah, cant believe you havent watched it yet mills
[5/10/17, 8:05:48 PM] Donk: It would be like launchpad not watching silicon valley
[5/10/17, 8:05:54 PM] Launchpad: Surprised you haven't yet. That would be like me not watching Silicon Valley or Steve never watching Waiters
[5/10/17, 8:05:58 PM] Launchpad: fuck
[5/10/17, 8:06:21 PM] Miller: Lol
[5/10/17, 8:06:55 PM] Miller: Yea soon, trying to catch up on better call saul for the time being
[5/10/17, 8:07:01 PM] Launchpad: saved by the new Herman 1 minute rule
[5/10/17, 8:08:38 PM] Justin: I'm in the better call Saul catch up now. Meant to ask this weeks ago. Anyone think season 2 blew season 1 out the water?
[5/10/17, 8:08:49 PM] Miller: Yes
[5/10/17, 8:09:02 PM] Justin: Season 2 became like a true prequel
[5/10/17, 8:09:05 PM] Launchpad: Season 3 is pretty good too
[5/10/17, 8:09:12 PM] Justin: 3 doing good continuing it
[5/10/17, 8:09:29 PM] Miller: I'm just amazed how good that show is
[5/10/17, 8:09:33 PM] Donk: Still need to watch breaking bad...
[5/10/17, 8:09:35 PM] Justin: But it's funny because I remember not getting into breaking bad until season 2
[5/10/17, 8:09:37 PM] Miller: Like spinoff generally such a bad idea
[5/10/17, 8:09:40 PM] Launchpad: well you knew it was going to pick up - just like breaking bad started slow
[5/10/17, 8:09:44 PM] Justin: So maybe it's just the type of show that needs to develop
[5/10/17, 8:09:56 PM] Miller: Sounds like another snow....
[5/10/17, 8:09:59 PM] Miller: Show
[5/10/17, 8:10:39 PM] Miller: Did you notice nobody gave a fuck about breaking bad until like season 4 when everyone started freaking out about it
[5/10/17, 8:10:56 PM] Launchpad: yeah pretty much lol
[5/10/17, 8:11:16 PM] Miller: I was literally the only person watching it, I tried to get Herman to watch it
[5/10/17, 8:11:18 PM] Launchpad: very first scene I saw was when gus fring stabbed that guy
[5/10/17, 8:11:31 PM] Miller: Nobody watched AMC though
[5/10/17, 8:11:41 PM] Launchpad: and I was like - guess I gotta watch the whole thing from the beginning now
[5/10/17, 8:19:12 PM] Launchpad: thats fucken funny
[5/10/17, 8:19:32 PM] Launchpad: I wonder if they have a bot that does that or a human
[5/10/17, 8:19:55 PM] Launchpad: probably a human unless the bots name is Jessica

[5/11/17, 10:54:20 PM] Steve: I'm down
[5/11/17, 10:54:26 PM] Steve: Always
[5/11/17, 10:58:23 PM] Scott: As a member of the relevant community who would know of and or use said hashtag I concur with Katz I've heard him say it alot and for a while.
[5/11/17, 10:58:44 PM] Steve: You just want him to agree with you
[5/11/17, 10:58:54 PM] Steve: Please, have a seat on a bench in astoria park
[5/11/17, 11:00:53 PM] Scott: No I'm home.

[5/11/17, 11:03:17 PM] Scott: No problem. It's easy to opine when ur telling the truth.
[5/11/17, 11:03:41 PM] Steve: #fakenews
[5/12/17, 2:10:54 AM] Justin: Kiyoon or Jim brown?
[5/12/17, 5:44:56 AM] Miller: While that guy is black, bald, and has a mustache that is definitely not Jim Brown. Probably like 30 years younger. Just saw JB during the draft and he is looking old and could like barely walk
[5/12/17, 7:25:07 AM] Steve: Thank you boys for both agreeing
[5/12/17, 7:25:37 AM] Steve: Once @16318489683 stops circle jerking @16102201963, he'll also agree.
[5/12/17, 7:46:40 AM] Miller: http://deadspin.com/whats-your-favorite-derek-jeter-moment-1795097798
[5/12/17, 7:50:31 AM] Scott: He looked like jim Brown while I was under the influence. Let it be.
[5/12/17, 8:11:45 AM] Brian Katz: What am I circle jerking cheese with?
[5/12/17, 8:13:27 AM] Steve: Usually your hand
[5/12/17, 8:13:30 AM] Steve: But you can do it however you want
[5/12/17, 8:16:04 AM] Scott: Better question is what aren't you?
[5/12/17, 8:28:18 AM] Miller: i searched for this, in the history of whatsapp #muchlove was not used until yesterday and "much love" was used 1 time by katz before, in a group cheese i not in.
Cheese has used the phrase once almost 2 years ago saying "cordarelle has never gotten this much love"
[5/12/17, 8:28:40 AM] Steve: Boom
[5/12/17, 8:30:06 AM] Steve: Was I in the chat the time katz used it?
[5/12/17, 8:30:07 AM] Steve: I'm sure the katz text has a time stamp
[5/12/17, 8:35:27 AM] Miller: you were
[5/12/17, 8:36:01 AM] Steve: Damn
[5/12/17, 8:36:12 AM] Steve: Was it a hashtag?
[5/12/17, 8:36:16 AM] Steve: Then it changes it
[5/12/17, 8:38:41 AM] Steve: Also, we all know cheese was trying to get on katz' good side to agree with him on the Jim brown debacle of 2017
[5/12/17, 8:40:10 AM] Miller: it was not a hash tag
[5/12/17, 8:40:53 AM] Steve: #cheesefail
[5/12/17, 8:42:06 AM] Donk: #cheesehasstillfailedtopaythismanhismoney #publicshaming
[5/12/17, 8:44:26 AM] Scott: It's in real life I'm talking
[5/12/17, 9:29:45 AM] Kiyoon: Cheese pay your debts
[5/12/17, 9:29:57 AM] Kiyoon: I won't lie that pic Herman posted does look like me haha
[5/12/17, 9:30:21 AM] Kiyoon: Who the hell did Phil Hughes win a world series with
[5/12/17, 9:31:27 AM] Scott: Yankees u moron
[5/12/17, 9:31:45 AM] Kiyoon: Why would I have known that?
[5/12/17, 9:32:23 AM] Kiyoon: I've always known Hughes to be a Twin
[5/12/17, 9:33:41 AM] Donk: Instead of paying me, cheese tries to get me to pay him lol
[5/12/17, 9:33:51 AM] Miller: hahaha
[5/12/17, 9:34:03 AM] Donk: Come on cheese
[5/12/17, 9:34:29 AM] Kiyoon: U MORON
[5/12/17, 9:34:52 AM] Kiyoon: smoke more weed cheese, smoke more weed
[5/12/17, 9:37:11 AM] Scott: Hahah
[5/12/17, 9:39:14 AM] Donk: Public shaming of cheese is finally over,  he has paid his debt
[5/12/17, 9:44:22 AM] Justin: Lol they were considering t when he was batting 227 also.
[5/12/17, 9:45:09 AM] Miller: one step closer
[5/12/17, 9:47:15 AM] Brian Katz: 265 today down 60lbs, coming for ya Herm lol
[5/12/17, 9:47:29 AM] Scott: Sick buddy congrats
[5/12/17, 9:48:13 AM] Brian Katz: Thanks Scott
[5/12/17, 9:52:12 AM] Justin: Why didn't you post the article where the tryout pitcher Confessed to feeding him fastballs?
[5/12/17, 9:53:01 AM] Miller: is he the designated pitcher against him in single A?
[5/12/17, 9:53:32 AM] Justin: Yeh 0 home runs in last 20 games with 250 batting average----pro ready
[5/12/17, 9:53:37 AM] Miller: its not that hard, im sure you could put up an 850 OPS in single A
[5/12/17, 9:53:39 AM] Justin: Definitely making progress
[5/12/17, 9:53:49 AM] Justin: Wouldn't bE getting promoted if name wasn't tebow
[5/12/17, 9:54:17 AM] Miller: wouldnt BE diminishing any good accomplishments if your name wasnt herman
[5/12/17, 9:54:19 AM] Miller: yet here we are
[5/12/17, 9:54:37 AM] Justin: What are we arguing here?
[5/12/17, 9:54:41 AM] Steve: Side note, master of one is back.
[5/12/17, 9:54:41 AM] Steve: *none
[5/12/17, 9:54:56 AM] Justin: Are those numbers worthy of a promotion?
[5/12/17, 9:55:21 AM] Justin: Using ops over 80 an sample size probably rediculous btw
[5/12/17, 9:57:37 AM] Justin: He's about 100th in slugging in a ball.
[5/12/17, 9:57:41 AM] Brian Katz: How many at bats is that......hater
[5/12/17, 9:58:18 AM] Justin: I mean miller I'm actually starting to cheer for tebow. To claim a promotion is anything short of celebrity driven is comical
[5/12/17, 9:58:25 AM] Brian Katz: Tebow is the man herman cmon quit hating
[5/12/17, 9:58:31 AM] Justin: Be kinda cool if he pulls it off
[5/12/17, 9:58:35 AM] Miller: funny way of cheering
[5/12/17, 9:58:45 AM] Justin: I'm just pointing out reality.
[5/12/17, 9:59:00 AM] Justin: Also pointing out he's doing much better than 3 weeks ago
[5/12/17, 9:59:22 AM] Justin: Honeruns arent there though.  Not sure about football rate and things like that
[5/12/17, 9:59:37 AM] Miller: football rate is 0%
[5/12/17, 9:59:42 AM] Justin: Flyball*
[5/12/17, 9:59:47 AM] Justin: Even apple knows though
[5/12/17, 10:01:45 AM] Justin: FYI oswaldo Arcia has a 1.2 ops in what id assume is triple a
[5/12/17, 10:03:02 AM] Miller: A.J. Green said fourth-round WR Josh Malone reminds him of a young Marvin Jones.
[5/12/17, 10:03:07 AM] Miller: guess we know who @16102201963 is taking
[5/12/17, 10:03:17 AM] Steve: Don't blame weed on cheese antics
[5/12/17, 10:03:23 AM] Steve: That's solely cheeses fault
[5/12/17, 10:04:04 AM] Justin: Why can't I find tebow on this http://m.milb.com/stats#/js/stats/?sort_by=class&o=afa&t=1&s=ops

[5/12/17, 10:25:42 AM] Justin: Eagerly awaiting
[5/12/17, 10:25:47 AM] Steve: Don't be that guy hating on tebow
[5/12/17, 10:26:11 AM] Miller: why you hatin from outside the club you can't even get in
[5/12/17, 10:26:13 AM] Justin: Not what goal here is. Goal here is to acknowledge facts , don't goalpost trump me
[5/12/17, 10:27:10 AM] Justin: Look plenty minor leaguers spend whole lives never getting Janice at majors and truth is plenty could been great ball players. Tebow will get that shot because he's tebow-so if he runs w it all the power to him.
[5/12/17, 10:27:16 AM] Justin: Chance*
[5/12/17, 10:27:57 AM] Miller: i doubt theres that many could have been great ball players toiling away in the minors, usually if you show any promise you get a chance
[5/12/17, 10:28:11 AM] Miller: ill need a list of names on my desk by noon
[5/12/17, 10:28:58 AM] Justin: It's logics based statement.
[5/12/17, 10:29:07 AM] Miller: no
[5/12/17, 10:29:12 AM] Miller: logic says if you play well you get promoted
[5/12/17, 10:29:17 AM] Miller: and you continue to get promoted
[5/12/17, 10:29:22 AM] Miller: until you get to the majors
[5/12/17, 10:29:36 AM] Justin: Yeh and now how do we define well?
[5/12/17, 10:29:35 AM] Miller: logic doesnt say you could have been great if only you got your chance
[5/12/17, 10:29:38 AM] Miller: thats you projecting
[5/12/17, 10:29:54 AM] Miller: we all know you were 1 bad break away from being in the majors
[5/12/17, 10:29:57 AM] Justin: And what factors come into play w "playing well"
[5/12/17, 10:29:56 AM] Launchpad: unless you are a women
[5/12/17, 10:30:44 AM] Justin: For example if a player at age 33 is leading the minors in ops, is he more or less likely to get a shot than a guy at 26?
[5/12/17, 10:30:44 AM] Miller: forget list of names, ill settle for 1 name
[5/12/17, 10:30:58 AM] Justin: Or asking me to prove a negative
[5/12/17, 10:31:05 AM] Miller: 1 guy who "could been great ball players"
[5/12/17, 10:31:07 AM] Justin: Impossible task
[5/12/17, 10:31:37 AM] Miller: sure and i could have been the next steph curry
[5/12/17, 10:31:44 AM] Justin: It's more the marginal difference between promotion and career minor leaguer isn't that great
[5/12/17, 10:31:43 AM] Miller: but i never got a chance to play in the NBA
[5/12/17, 10:31:45 AM] Miller: so well never knnow
[5/12/17, 10:31:55 AM] Justin: We're not talking about you
[5/12/17, 10:32:15 AM] Justin: We're talking about players whom are playing at near the top level in their sport
[5/12/17, 10:32:43 AM] Miller: were not talking about anyone actually
[5/12/17, 10:32:52 AM] Miller: just hypothetical imaginary people
[5/12/17, 10:33:01 AM] Miller: of which my NBA career qualifies
[5/12/17, 10:33:20 AM] Justin: Anyway please continue the hypothetical instead of acknowledging you claimed tebow had a anemic 850 ops when in reality he has a 700
[5/12/17, 10:33:26 AM] Justin: Should he be promoted on that?
[5/12/17, 10:33:40 AM] Miller: the fact you think an 850 OPS is anemic shows how much you know about baseball
[5/12/17, 10:33:42 AM] Miller: go back to france
[5/12/17, 10:33:52 AM] Justin: Lol keep not admitting to being wrong
[5/12/17, 10:34:40 AM] Justin: 850 ops in triple a would be near top 100. Meaning I would take a flier on tebow in a minors only fantasy league
[5/12/17, 10:34:51 AM] Justin: A 700 is closer to bottom 95Th percentile
[5/12/17, 10:35:00 AM] Justin: Which means.....
[5/12/17, 10:35:15 AM] Miller: your hypothetical minors fantasy league
[5/12/17, 10:35:20 AM] Miller: full of hypothetical players
[5/12/17, 10:35:24 AM] Miller: are you hypothetically in 1st at least?
[5/12/17, 10:35:32 AM] Justin: Lol the words I'm wrong will never leave your mouth I get it
[5/12/17, 10:36:11 AM] Launchpad: how many butts in seats (BIS) per game is Tebow averaging?
[5/12/17, 10:36:43 AM] Miller: let me rephrase
[5/12/17, 10:36:51 AM] Launchpad: BIS is a long forgotten, although fundamentally important, Moneyball metric
[5/12/17, 10:37:17 AM] Justin: He definitely is bringing the "biz"
[5/12/17, 10:37:59 AM] Miller: its not that hard, im sure you could put up an 850 OPS in single A OVER 16 games
[5/12/17, 10:38:05 AM] Miller: happy now?
[5/12/17, 10:38:22 AM] Miller: does adding 16 games somehow change the message or invalidate my point?
[5/12/17, 10:38:36 AM] Justin: Back to sample size. 16 games ops is meaningless
[5/12/17, 10:38:45 AM] Miller: good
[5/12/17, 10:38:45 AM] Miller: didnt think so
[5/12/17, 10:38:52 AM] Justin: It is
[5/12/17, 10:38:53 AM] Miller: so no i will not say im wrong when i didnt say anything wrong
[5/12/17, 10:38:56 AM] Justin: Literally is
[5/12/17, 10:38:59 AM] Miller: so you could do it?
[5/12/17, 10:39:02 AM] Justin: Ops is based on 4.0
[5/12/17, 10:39:08 AM] Justin: And 1.0 is insane ops
[5/12/17, 10:39:25 AM] Justin: So think about he distortion in that over 50 ab
[5/12/17, 10:39:24 AM] Miller: if im wrong then you are saying you could put up an 850 OPS in a 16 game sample
[5/12/17, 10:39:44 AM] Justin: Oh god
[5/12/17, 10:39:54 AM] Justin: How can that be your default comeback
[5/12/17, 10:40:00 AM] Miller: yea didnt think so
[5/12/17, 10:40:18 AM] Justin: What was his obp in that sample?
[5/12/17, 10:40:26 AM] Miller: do you even put up an 850 OPS in old man slow pitch fastball playing against mentally challenged kids and 65 year olds who cant move?
[5/12/17, 10:40:29 AM] Justin: At least more reliable than slugging
[5/12/17, 10:40:46 AM] Justin: I think everyone does and there are no walks
[5/12/17, 10:41:26 AM] Miller: please calculate your stats over the next 16 games
[5/12/17, 10:41:53 AM] Miller: maybe if you play well enough you can get promoted to the slow pitch softball league
[5/12/17, 10:42:11 AM] Miller: from there only about 47 more levels b/w you and tebow
[5/12/17, 10:45:05 AM] Justin: Breaking news player in bottom 95Th percentile with huge bis %, just got promoted. Hugely was achievement based promotion, best promotion, really really best. Even Mike Miller approves
[5/12/17, 10:46:00 AM] Launchpad: more important than OPS...what does Tebow think about abortion, homosexuality and 'the theory' of evolution?
[5/12/17, 10:46:25 AM] Justin: He's likely a mouth breather on all that, separate from baseball
[5/12/17, 10:46:47 AM] Launchpad: boycott tebow!
[5/12/17, 10:47:06 AM] Steve: I'm sure he has very strong views that most of us don't agree with
[5/12/17, 10:47:11 AM] Justin: Um only conservatives have boycotted a player for political actions
[5/12/17, 10:47:17 AM] Steve: But that doesn't make him a bad guy
[5/12/17, 10:47:21 AM] Steve: Like my cousins
[5/12/17, 10:47:50 AM] Launchpad: I think SF management boycotted Kapernick first
[5/12/17, 10:47:54 AM] Justin: Just saying over and over again the right side of the spectrum seems to be snowflakes
[5/12/17, 10:48:06 AM] Steve: They are all trumpeters but they are still good people
[5/12/17, 10:49:09 AM] Justin: And yeh once again Steve I could care less about his political views and sports career. I mean I might dislike the guy, doesn't mean I can't acknowledge ability.
[5/12/17, 10:49:32 AM] Steve: My statement was more towards LP
[5/12/17, 10:49:35 AM] Steve: Clearly lol
[5/12/17, 10:49:42 AM] Steve: But sure
[5/12/17, 10:49:44 AM] Steve: I get that
[5/12/17, 10:50:24 AM] Justin: yeh and for the chat because apparently a 18 game sample size was important.....http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2707779-tim-tebow-reportedly-had-pitches-grooved-by-chad-smith-during-mlb-tryout
[5/12/17, 10:56:15 AM] Justin: fyi your article cant be fctually correct
[5/12/17, 10:56:21 AM] Justin: it was written on may 2nd?
[5/12/17, 10:56:24 AM] Justin: and said 18 games?
[5/12/17, 10:56:56 AM] Justin: he had only palyed 18 games up till that point
[5/12/17, 10:57:01 AM] Justin: and didnt have a 850 ops
[5/12/17, 10:57:29 AM] Miller: so 16 game sample size is irrelevant
[5/12/17, 10:57:36 AM] Miller: but batting practice during a tryout is?
[5/12/17, 10:57:44 AM] Miller: sure üëç
[5/12/17, 10:57:50 AM] Justin: thats why i didnt bother to post it originally
[5/12/17, 10:57:58 AM] Justin: and read my sentecne below article
[5/12/17, 10:58:07 AM] Justin: which says being that we are beign stupid about things.....
[5/12/17, 10:58:21 AM] Miller: https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/mets-considering-promotion-for-tebow/229789964 feel free to fact check it
[5/12/17, 10:59:07 AM] Justin: ok its form today
[5/12/17, 10:59:13 AM] Justin: dont know why i thoguht it was may 2nd
[5/12/17, 10:59:14 AM] Miller: so you admit you dislike tebow
[5/12/17, 10:59:31 AM] Justin: honestly havent heard him speak much, would assume i do though
[5/12/17, 10:59:38 AM] Justin: sure as fuck wouldnt wnat him runnign for office
[5/12/17, 10:59:40 AM] Miller: so in conclusion
[5/12/17, 10:59:42 AM] Miller: you are a hater
[5/12/17, 10:59:46 AM] Miller: we have settled it
[5/12/17, 10:59:48 AM] Justin: lol
[5/12/17, 11:00:28 AM] Justin: he be great player in my sunday baseball league
[5/12/17, 11:01:12 AM] Justin: shockingly the mets used 16 games because two game sbefore that he was 0-8
[5/12/17, 11:04:44 AM] Kiyoon: I think he's referring to when Nixon did that
[5/12/17, 11:05:02 AM] Kiyoon: but yeah, still not well said with the quotes lol
[5/12/17, 11:05:51 AM] Justin: add those two games in an ops drops by 80 points....but hey not a small sample size or anything
[5/12/17, 11:05:58 AM] Justin: with that im done was fun
[5/12/17, 11:06:28 AM] Justin: pretty sure if comey wnate dto leak and made deal with pence...pence pardon him
[5/12/17, 11:06:28 AM] Miller: so 850 goes to 770, a more reasonable level, something you could now accomplish over 18 games in single A
[5/12/17, 11:06:40 AM] Justin: i give up
[5/12/17, 11:06:47 AM] Justin: you are generalyl good with amth so this is just stupid
[5/12/17, 11:06:55 AM] Miller: or is it "stupid"
[5/12/17, 11:06:59 AM] Justin: i dont get if its mets allegiance tebow allegiance herman hating allegiance
[5/12/17, 11:07:14 AM] Miller: 60/40 the last 2
[5/12/17, 11:11:08 AM] Justin: üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
[5/12/17, 11:11:14 AM] Justin: 320 AB: SLG
[5/12/17, 11:11:21 AM] Justin: 460 PA: OBP
[5/12/17, 11:14:32 AM] Justin: contrary to what i would have expected though..910 AB: AVG
[5/12/17, 11:15:08 AM] Justin: Which means it takes seasons for batting average to normalize
[5/12/17, 11:22:32 AM] Steve: He always puts quotes around things
[5/12/17, 11:22:43 AM] Steve: It's to say later, "I was just quoting"
[5/12/17, 11:22:46 AM] Steve: That's not my words
[5/12/17, 11:22:50 AM] Miller: its "crazy"
[5/12/17, 11:30:30 AM] Justin: ne wone
[5/12/17, 11:30:40 AM] Miller: ne wone indeed
[5/12/17, 11:30:54 AM] Miller: for the sake of "accuracy"
[5/12/17, 11:31:08 AM] Justin: in this case press breifings may in fact be hypothetical in the near future, in which case hes now also a soothsayer
[5/12/17, 11:33:22 AM] Miller: soup dumplings today, so fucking good
[5/12/17, 11:33:29 AM] Steve: Eh
[5/12/17, 11:33:40 AM] Steve: Would rather have taco Tuesday
[5/12/17, 11:33:41 AM] Miller: or Xiaolongbao for my asian friends
[5/12/17, 11:34:03 AM] Kiyoon: have you guys watched this seasons silicon valley
[5/12/17, 11:34:10 AM] Miller: https://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/dumpling_eng.html the tom brady of soup dumplings
[5/12/17, 11:34:21 AM] Miller: im 1 behind i think
[5/12/17, 11:34:38 AM] Kiyoon: I thought this last one was one of their more hilarious episodes
[5/12/17, 11:35:27 AM] Donk: Love me some soup dumplings
[5/12/17, 11:38:10 AM] Steve: That's what she said?
[5/12/17, 11:41:00 AM] Launchpad: nice twist at the nd
[5/12/17, 11:41:09 AM] Launchpad: interesting to see how that plays out
[5/12/17, 11:48:56 AM] Kiyoon: I pissed my pants at the screaming scene
[5/12/17, 12:16:21 PM] Miller: Pretty sure I just saw Al Sharpton
[5/12/17, 12:16:29 PM] Miller: Couldn't get my phone out in time
[5/12/17, 12:16:37 PM] Miller: Also could have been Jim Brown
[5/12/17, 12:17:08 PM] Steve: #cheeseracism
[5/12/17, 12:22:52 PM] Launchpad: The gift that keeps giving #fyrefestival
[5/12/17, 12:23:51 PM] Dan Watts: He should be put in jail
[5/12/17, 7:47:54 PM] Justin: Lol
[5/12/17, 7:48:23 PM] Steve: Why is that funny?
[5/12/17, 7:48:30 PM] Justin: Billy is funny
[5/12/17, 7:48:37 PM] Justin: Gotta expand it
[5/12/17, 8:01:10 PM] Justin: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qUc3Etmbzdc
[5/12/17, 8:01:28 PM] Justin: Does anyone find this song similar to a pop song on radio
[5/12/17, 8:01:54 PM] Justin: Disclaimer not asking if you like it I just heard it and was like wtf
[5/12/17, 8:03:49 PM] Steve: That was an awful song. Please  never music again. Thank you!
[5/12/17, 8:04:10 PM] Justin: Did you listen for minute or two
[5/12/17, 8:04:20 PM] Scott: Dna on the new Kendrick album is the ill song right now n
[5/12/17, 8:04:24 PM] Scott: The flow is insane.
[5/12/17, 8:05:02 PM] Steve: I got a 90 second rule
[5/12/17, 8:05:21 PM] Scott: That's what you say to every girl.
[5/12/17, 8:05:43 PM] Steve: Don't see anything wrong with that either
[5/12/17, 8:05:47 PM] Justin: I thought it sounded identical to Sam Elliot stay with me.
[5/12/17, 8:06:00 PM] Justin: Which is ironic because he stole that from Tom petty.
[5/12/17, 8:06:05 PM] Justin: Apprently
[5/12/17, 8:06:19 PM] Steve: It's similar
[5/12/17, 8:06:22 PM] Steve: Not identical
[5/12/17, 8:06:32 PM] Steve: But I'm sure you can find many songs like that
[5/12/17, 8:07:13 PM] Justin: I mean it's got the same tempo in chorus and the piano leading out and into chorus. And upbeat drum tempo in middle.
[5/12/17, 8:07:32 PM] Justin: But yeh nowhere near  identical just strikingly similar
[5/12/17, 8:09:41 PM] Steve: How's life buddy?
[5/12/17, 8:42:53 PM] Justin: https://www.highstakesdb.com/7843-poker-pro-to-eat-1000-of-mcdonalds-food-in-36-hours-for-prop-bet.aspx
[5/12/17, 8:43:21 PM] Miller: Pro? Someone sure has a high opinion of themselves
[5/12/17, 8:45:48 PM] Launchpad: better make sure he only buys 5 piece nuggets and not a 20 pack
[5/12/17, 8:47:22 PM] Launchpad: nows not the time to explore the dollar menu
[5/12/17, 8:50:01 PM] Justin: yeh no fucken shot
[5/12/17, 8:50:16 PM] Justin: plans on eating apple slices 1$=15 calories worth slices
[5/12/17, 8:50:28 PM] Justin: so thats 500$ with other requirements
[5/12/17, 9:04:44 PM] Launchpad: Anyone want to see  Giants vs. Cardinals on Christmas Eve?
[5/12/17, 9:04:57 PM] Miller: Can't do it
[5/12/17, 10:39:11 PM] Miller: How the fuck did he make that
[5/12/17, 10:39:51 PM] Scott: I may be in @16195657200
[5/12/17, 11:05:40 PM] Justin: Masters of none crushing it again. Halfway through new season
[5/12/17, 11:08:05 PM] Steve: Can wait to watch it
[5/12/17, 11:08:10 PM] Steve: Might start it tonight
[5/12/17, 11:10:54 PM] Steve: Figured aziz in Italy will be equally as funny as aziz in New York
[5/12/17, 11:22:31 PM] Justin: Yeh hes just so good at painting the reality behind all these topics in a hilarious way, it's essentially Seinfeld of 21st century.
[5/12/17, 11:38:59 PM] Steve: Well it helps that he also lives those realities
[5/12/17, 11:39:19 PM] Steve: Dot know if Larry David lived all the Seinfeld situations which is more impressive
[5/13/17, 9:12:17 AM] Kiyoon: Haha that's hilarious
[5/14/17, 10:29:24 AM] Brian Katz: Happy mothers at to all you guys special ladies today
[5/14/17, 12:18:29 PM] Steve: Katz I'm signing up for a 5k sometime this summer, you still interested in joining?
[5/14/17, 1:23:33 PM] Brian Katz: Yes
[5/14/17, 1:23:39 PM] Brian Katz: Just tell me when
[5/14/17, 1:25:42 PM] Dan Watts: @13478047760 I'm down too but for July. My fitness is total shit right now
[5/14/17, 1:27:26 PM] Justin: Katz you been doing cArdio?
[5/14/17, 1:30:34 PM] Steve: Ok
[5/14/17, 1:30:47 PM] Steve: I'll sign us up for something in july
[5/14/17, 1:30:53 PM] Steve: Let you both know
[5/14/17, 1:31:33 PM] Justin: Curious what's the cost on a 5k?
[5/14/17, 1:32:25 PM] Justin: Seems kinda frivolous for you Steve considering you are doing multiple 10k's throughout a week
[5/14/17, 1:38:23 PM] Justin: Hey lp, Facebook is mischaracterizing you as liking a guy who thinks voter fraud is bullshit. I think they deserve an angry email.
[5/14/17, 1:43:36 PM] Scott: Is 13 reasons why any good?
[5/14/17, 1:46:13 PM] Steve: I am just doing smaller runs as a warm up for my half in October
[5/14/17, 1:46:24 PM] Steve: And it's usually about 30-40
[5/14/17, 2:00:04 PM] Justin: master of none before 13 reasons why
[5/14/17, 3:33:17 PM] Brian Katz: I've been playing sports. If I can't run anymore, is figure I'd walk until I can start up again @16316620763
[5/14/17, 3:34:03 PM] Miller: Don't worry I did a half marathon and I can't run
[5/14/17, 3:39:11 PM] Brian Katz: Thanks mike
[5/14/17, 3:41:17 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/14/17, 3:41:32 PM] Steve: Took him almost 6 hours and he couldn't walk for days
[5/14/17, 3:49:19 PM] Justin: yeh i know the feeling, I'm hoping losing some weight will help alleviate in the can't run anymore department(likely helping you alot as well)... I'm gonna start pushing some sleds, battle ropes, tire-flipping soon enough.  New lifting routine gets me in and out of gym in under an hour so no reason not to add some strength based cardio.
[5/14/17, 3:54:16 PM] Miller: Hey only like 50% of that is true
[5/14/17, 3:58:26 PM] Brian Katz: I'm going to try and start jogging a little now to prep, so I don't have a heart attack lol
[5/14/17, 3:59:52 PM] Justin: 5 k wont be that bad... can probably get some 0 to 5k porgrams like pushup program in under 10 weeks
[5/14/17, 4:39:30 PM] Brian Katz: True, that's a good idea, I'll look it up
[5/15/17, 11:20:50 AM] Launchpad: Who doesn't have a place yet for Austin?
[5/15/17, 11:21:34 AM] Steve: Cheese
[5/15/17, 11:21:39 AM] Launchpad: Me and Cheese are getting a place and I am going to book soon
[5/15/17, 11:21:53 AM] Launchpad: who/how many people are going?
[5/15/17, 11:22:11 AM] Steve: I heard he bought you a pair of green booty shorts to immaterial the occasion
[5/15/17, 11:22:22 AM] Launchpad: lol
[5/15/17, 11:22:39 AM] Steve: Commemorate*
[5/15/17, 11:23:35 AM] Donk: Weird autocorrect
[5/15/17, 11:24:57 AM] Steve: Don't really use either word that gone
[5/15/17, 11:25:00 AM] Steve: *often

[5/15/17, 12:35:09 PM] Scott: Feinberg doesn't have a place.
[5/15/17, 12:35:16 PM] Miller: hes going?
[5/15/17, 12:35:26 PM] Scott: He said he might.
[5/15/17, 12:35:31 PM] Miller: that avril lavigne thing is literally like 5 years old
[5/15/17, 12:35:32 PM] Scott: When I spoke to him last
[5/15/17, 12:35:45 PM] Miller: so is he going to actually book a room on a maybe?
[5/15/17, 12:38:54 PM] Launchpad: btw, real dirty sticking me with cheese like this
[5/15/17, 3:08:12 PM] Donk: Well this beta story from penn state is front page news on cnn right now
[5/15/17, 3:08:25 PM] Donk: Not to mention the piece of the today show this morning
[5/15/17, 3:08:38 PM] Donk: Those guys suck, giving us all a bad name
[5/15/17, 3:09:49 PM] Kiyoon: that coulda been joey chemo that one night
[5/15/17, 3:09:54 PM] Kiyoon: think it was big brother night
[5/15/17, 3:14:30 PM] Miller: that was exactly what i said to whoever told me about this on saturday
[5/15/17, 3:15:17 PM] Donk: Joey chemo was black out drunk for sure.  But he didnt fall down a flight of stairs and then we did nothing about it
[5/15/17, 3:16:15 PM] Donk: Whats crazy is that the majority of their house had video cameras
[5/15/17, 3:16:29 PM] Miller: sounds like something cheese would do
[5/15/17, 3:16:32 PM] Miller: that would then backfire on us
[5/15/17, 3:46:50 PM] Kiyoon: i mean that's pretty easy to say now, but he was put on a couch
[5/15/17, 3:47:07 PM] Kiyoon: when you guys went downtown, and he gets up and he falls down the stairs
[5/15/17, 3:47:41 PM] Steve: It could have absolutely happened on anyone's house
[5/15/17, 3:47:46 PM] Donk: Sure,  its possible
[5/15/17, 3:47:48 PM] Kiyoon: and someone hammered comes back from downtown and puts him on a couch thinkin he was just drunk
[5/15/17, 3:47:53 PM] Steve: Very likely
[5/15/17, 3:48:10 PM] Steve: And most of us slept until 2-3 the next day
[5/15/17, 3:48:12 PM] Donk: But that didnt happe. Here
[5/15/17, 3:48:17 PM] Steve: Sure
[5/15/17, 3:48:19 PM] Donk: They knew he fell down tbe stairs
[5/15/17, 3:48:27 PM] Donk: And chose to do nothing
[5/15/17, 3:48:34 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[5/15/17, 3:49:11 PM] Steve: And now, true to penn state, they are trying to distance themselves from it.
[5/15/17, 3:49:14 PM] Kiyoon: he fell down the stairs, they put him on the couch
[5/15/17, 3:49:18 PM] Steve: Instead of admitting wrongdoing
[5/15/17, 3:49:32 PM] Kiyoon: and then he got up, fell down the stairs again in the basement and no one saw until the morning
[5/15/17, 3:49:55 PM] Donk: No, they sae it the 2nd and 3rd time and put him back on the couch
[5/15/17, 3:50:25 PM] Miller: how many times did this kid  fall down the fucking stairs
[5/15/17, 3:50:30 PM] Donk: 3 apparantly
[5/15/17, 3:50:38 PM] Donk: One full time and 2 partial times
[5/15/17, 3:50:41 PM] Miller: at some point just leave him at the bottom
[5/15/17, 3:52:01 PM] Donk: We do know that if one of us gets a broken ankle that we do the right thing and get them to hospital
[5/15/17, 3:52:12 PM] Donk: Even when in a different country
[5/15/17, 3:52:17 PM] Kiyoon: Donk that's 10 years later
[5/15/17, 3:52:20 PM] Donk: Haha
[5/15/17, 3:52:27 PM] Kiyoon: and it was
[5/15/17, 3:52:29 PM] Kiyoon: ONLY Steve
[5/15/17, 3:52:32 PM] Kiyoon: where were you???
[5/15/17, 3:52:35 PM] Steve: #fact
[5/15/17, 3:52:37 PM] Donk: I wasnt there
[5/15/17, 3:52:45 PM] Steve: They all bounced or were too intoxicated
[5/15/17, 3:52:48 PM] Donk: I had already gone home, didnt know it happened until later
[5/15/17, 3:53:01 PM] Donk: Nah, just wanted poutine
[5/15/17, 3:53:19 PM] Steve: Lol you were obsessed with poutine
[5/15/17, 3:53:27 PM] Steve: Along with Scottie who later died because of it
[5/15/17, 3:53:31 PM] Steve: RIP LP
[5/15/17, 3:53:41 PM] Donk: While in college thougj, did bust my head open at formal and gotten taken to the hosptial for some staples
[5/15/17, 3:53:52 PM] Donk: So there is that
[5/15/17, 3:53:55 PM] Miller: didnt davi do that to you?
[5/15/17, 3:54:03 PM] Donk: He did
[5/15/17, 3:54:08 PM] Steve: We were always reluctant to call ambulance/cops
[5/15/17, 3:54:22 PM] Steve: Which is why this situation could have happened to us
[5/15/17, 3:54:26 PM] Donk: LP busted his head open and refused the hospital trip
[5/15/17, 3:54:27 PM] Steve: Not necessarily like this
[5/15/17, 3:54:31 PM] Steve: But something similar
[5/15/17, 3:54:43 PM] Donk: For the most part if someone needed a dr we got them there
[5/15/17, 3:54:50 PM] Miller: did he? i thought he asked and nobody wanted to drive
[5/15/17, 3:54:59 PM] Kiyoon: I basically had alcohol poisoning after Drew shoved halfa bottle of bacardi vanilla down my throat
[5/15/17, 3:55:05 PM] Steve: We constantly just threw drunk people in open suites and then checked on them 8,10, 12 hours later
[5/15/17, 3:55:11 PM] Kiyoon: threw up all over feinbergs bed and I was put on the couch
[5/15/17, 3:55:12 PM] Kiyoon: right
[5/15/17, 3:55:13 PM] Donk: I wasnt there, but the story i heard was that he refused
[5/15/17, 3:55:27 PM] Steve: It happens all the time
[5/15/17, 3:55:33 PM] Miller: @16072459839 would remember
[5/15/17, 3:55:35 PM] Donk: Drunk is different from injured in a fall though
[5/15/17, 3:55:57 PM] Steve: Now I'm not saying we would have done that if we saw someone absolutely pummeled from falling down stairs 3 times but you can say never either
[5/15/17, 3:56:06 PM] Donk: When somone was hurt we generally did the right thing
[5/15/17, 3:56:22 PM] Steve: But this kid got hurt because of his drunkenness
[5/15/17, 3:56:32 PM] Steve: He wasn't sober falling down stairs
[5/15/17, 3:56:58 PM] Donk: Same with me busting my head open
[5/15/17, 3:57:10 PM] Steve: Again, I think we all would have done the right thing but I don't know in college.
[5/15/17, 3:57:13 PM] Donk: Id like to think we would have done the right thing
[5/15/17, 3:57:20 PM] Launchpad: i was fine, just needed a few stiches ;)
[5/15/17, 3:57:24 PM] Steve: Going out and having sex was atop our priority lists
[5/15/17, 3:57:31 PM] Steve: I would to
[5/15/17, 3:57:36 PM] Donk: Luckily we didnt have.to find out
[5/15/17, 3:57:38 PM] Steve: But it wouldn't have shocked me either
[5/15/17, 3:57:50 PM] Launchpad: üôå
[5/15/17, 4:34:36 PM] Steve: You all need to start following korbin_jackson on insta
[5/15/17, 4:34:39 PM] Steve: Kids got skills
[5/15/17, 4:35:07 PM] James  L: At least they didn't draw penis all over him in sharpie maker
[5/15/17, 4:43:26 PM] Launchpad: very stupid considering they had all those cameras on them
[5/15/17, 5:24:32 PM] James  L: Double edge sword... cameras can save you or hurt you
[5/15/17, 5:24:45 PM] James  L: I have that issue at work all the time
[5/15/17, 5:26:20 PM] James  L: Clears many allegations but 
Also validates them
[5/15/17, 5:26:25 PM] James  L: Others
[5/15/17, 5:33:28 PM] Launchpad: some guy got fired in my office cause he got caught on camera boning his wife (allegedly)
[5/15/17, 5:33:42 PM] Launchpad: He also named his kids Peter Parker and Clark Kent
[5/15/17, 5:41:45 PM] Steve: Why are you banging your wife in your office?
[5/15/17, 5:41:56 PM] Steve: Do you not have a bedroom in your home? Lol
[5/15/17, 5:42:11 PM] Launchpad: Did I say I got fired?
[5/15/17, 5:42:28 PM] Launchpad: Cameras will catch us there too üòà
[5/15/17, 5:42:41 PM] Steve: It's also not directed towards you
[5/15/17, 5:42:52 PM] Steve: It's a rhetorical question(s)
[5/15/17, 5:42:59 PM] Steve: Just makes very little sense to me
[5/15/17, 5:43:11 PM] Launchpad: gotcha
[5/15/17, 5:43:23 PM] Steve: Especially with a wife
[5/15/17, 5:43:34 PM] Steve: If she is a girlfriend or a mistress it makes a little more sense
[5/15/17, 5:43:39 PM] Steve: But you live with your wife
[5/15/17, 5:43:42 PM] Launchpad: he worked customer support, so he was at the office later than everyone else
[5/15/17, 5:43:58 PM] Launchpad: and the office was empty, but he didn't realize that there was a camera
[5/15/17, 5:44:34 PM] Launchpad: and this is the rumor, because the company doesn't disclose this information
[5/15/17, 5:45:06 PM] Steve: Still doesn't make sense why he would bone his wife at work
[5/15/17, 5:45:10 PM] Steve: They live together
[5/15/17, 5:45:26 PM] Steve: Presumably
[5/15/17, 5:45:29 PM] Brian Katz: Because it's sexy steve
[5/15/17, 5:45:39 PM] Steve: It's not at all
[5/15/17, 5:45:46 PM] Steve: I've done it with a girlfriend
[5/15/17, 5:46:05 PM] Steve: It's awkward and you constantly think someone will see you and/or walk in
[5/15/17, 5:47:16 PM] Miller: lololol
[5/15/17, 5:47:20 PM] Miller: why would anyone do that?!
[5/15/17, 5:47:24 PM] Miller: also, ive done it
[5/15/17, 5:47:40 PM] Steve: I'm saying with a wife who you live with
[5/15/17, 5:47:45 PM] Steve: I didn't live with my girlfriend
[5/15/17, 5:47:57 PM] Steve: You literally share a bed with your wife
[5/15/17, 5:48:34 PM] Miller: same reason people (constantly) get caught boning in public
[5/15/17, 5:48:45 PM] Brian Katz: It's hot
[5/15/17, 5:48:48 PM] Launchpad: maybe he was having too much boring missionary sex and they wanted to spice up the marriage
[5/15/17, 5:49:01 PM] Steve: Maybe
[5/15/17, 5:56:53 PM] Steve: http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/ar-BBBaWuJ?ocid=sf
[5/15/17, 5:56:53 PM] Steve: Cue burning house fire dog
[5/15/17, 6:03:50 PM] Dan Watts: Fake news!!!
[5/15/17, 6:04:42 PM] Dan Watts: If true, this should be the fatal blows which starts impeachment proceedings
[5/15/17, 6:05:25 PM] Launchpad: how many times have we heard that when Obama was president
[5/15/17, 6:05:48 PM] Donk: None?
[5/15/17, 6:06:07 PM] Miller: how many times have we heard that in the last 3 months?
[5/15/17, 6:06:11 PM] Donk: At least not to this real of a level
[5/15/17, 6:06:36 PM] Launchpad: unless you read breitbart, fox news, etc
[5/15/17, 6:07:05 PM] Steve: So either white supremacists or sexual predators
[5/15/17, 6:07:17 PM] Steve: I'd rather listen to MSNBC
[5/15/17, 6:07:43 PM] Donk: Yeah, i wouldnt count breibart as real news
[5/15/17, 6:07:53 PM] Donk: Foxnews is closer to real
[5/15/17, 6:08:07 PM] Steve: Setting a very low bar
[5/15/17, 6:08:10 PM] Steve: But I'd agree
[5/15/17, 6:08:41 PM] Launchpad: thats fine, Im just saying the noise is the same, its just coming from a different side of the aisle
[5/15/17, 6:08:58 PM] Donk: Yes and no
[5/15/17, 6:09:04 PM] Steve: That's a different side of reality
[5/15/17, 6:09:07 PM] Steve: Not the aisle
[5/15/17, 6:09:09 PM] Donk: The opposite of breibart isnt cnn
[5/15/17, 6:09:15 PM] Steve: lol
[5/15/17, 6:09:55 PM] Donk: Id maybe say foxnews is the same as msnbc
[5/15/17, 6:10:03 PM] Steve: Breitbart employees would probably have Obama as a slave if it was still the law of the land
[5/15/17, 6:10:34 PM] Steve: Or at least the founders of it would
[5/15/17, 6:11:11 PM] Steve: I'd agree that Fox News is much more the other side of the aisle
[5/15/17, 6:12:32 PM] Justin: Lol false equivalence.
[5/15/17, 6:13:41 PM] Justin: So white privilege isn't real but allegations of actual crimes are all equivalent ? Got it.
[5/15/17, 6:13:45 PM] Steve: Well we got Herman off the couch at least
[5/15/17, 6:14:48 PM] Launchpad: Did Hilary ever get in trouble?
[5/15/17, 6:14:55 PM] Justin: Also I mean other than "Iran for money deal" can't really think of the right really getting obama getting anything
[5/15/17, 6:14:58 PM] Launchpad: how many scandals has she been involved in
[5/15/17, 6:15:08 PM] Justin: 1 she's not obama
[5/15/17, 6:15:20 PM] Justin: So there's your original statement
[5/15/17, 6:15:27 PM] Justin: 2. That's not any better.
[5/15/17, 6:15:39 PM] Launchpad: Ill bet you $100 Trump wont get impeached over this
[5/15/17, 6:15:42 PM] Justin: There were dozens of committees and investigations of Benghazi
[5/15/17, 6:16:01 PM] Launchpad: and there will be all sorts of investigations into Trump
[5/15/17, 6:16:07 PM] Launchpad: which will probably amount to nothing
[5/15/17, 6:16:20 PM] Justin: I mean I dont doubt that , doesn't excuse false equivalence
[5/15/17, 6:16:28 PM] Launchpad: I'm just being a realist - Im not defending Trump
[5/15/17, 6:16:46 PM] Justin: But you equivocated he implications not the results
[5/15/17, 6:17:02 PM] Justin: If that's what your saying, yeh trump likely won't get impeached for anything
[5/15/17, 6:17:06 PM] Justin: Agreed
[5/15/17, 6:17:52 PM] Justin: Another words I disagree with his
[5/15/17, 6:24:29 PM] Launchpad: https://www.upworthy.com/scientists-on-3-continents-now-have-evidence-some-chimps-have-entered-the-stone-age
[5/15/17, 6:24:54 PM] Launchpad: How soon before they have their own etrade accounts?
[5/15/17, 6:44:57 PM] Justin: Gonna call that new herman.
[5/15/17, 6:45:11 PM] Justin: Because it's old old.

[5/15/17, 9:20:02 PM] Steve: It's just the natural progression
[5/15/17, 9:38:19 PM] Launchpad: James always looked like the guy on the right so its been an easy transition
[5/15/17, 9:49:52 PM] James  L: Wow
[5/15/17, 9:54:57 PM] Dan Watts: Wow that's a fantastic picture
[5/15/17, 9:55:31 PM] Launchpad: amazing
[5/15/17, 9:55:57 PM] Launchpad: why you're stalking my pics from 5-7 years ago, who cares??
[5/15/17, 9:57:09 PM] Steve: Stalking? Don't give yourself more credit than you deserve
[5/15/17, 9:57:22 PM] Steve: You have about 12 Facebook pictures and that's number 7
[5/15/17, 10:00:50 PM] Dan Watts: Def taken after eating Gail's booty

[5/16/17, 11:40:55 AM] Justin: LP dream spot for you to actually read an article we both would agree with.   Got linked to it from quora, and he mentions Tim ferrit's.   Seems like hes of the self help variety of tim ferrits with a masters in kineseology.  I think its a good overall explanation of building a workout program, probably a good read for you @16318489683 https://thequintessentialman.com/bodybuilding-101-a-kinesiologists-perspective/
[5/16/17, 11:49:01 AM] Justin: Also could be fake news obviously , but damnnn. https://medium.com/@newprogmedia/breaking-investigator-hired-by-murdered-dnc-staffer-seth-richs-family-says-there-s-evidence-of-7557664a3a5
[5/16/17, 11:49:44 AM] Justin: Claiming the dnc staffer who was murdered in D.C. Couple months ago was a source of leaks to Wikileaks.
[5/16/17, 4:05:40 PM] Dan Watts: McMaster yesterday said Trump didn't leak intel to russians, then Trump tweets he did leak intel but nbd he's allowed to do it, and today McMaster did a press conference saying whatever Trump said to russians is permissible. ü§•
[5/16/17, 4:50:59 PM] Justin: In deference to legal jargain he did say "that didn't happen ".
[5/16/17, 4:51:01 PM] Justin: Lol
[5/16/17, 4:52:00 PM] Justin: And " the story is false ".very well crafted ambiguous words which like a slimy fuck he could use to shift to today's nonsense.
[5/16/17, 5:43:14 PM] Steve: Whoever is still on this trump train is both stupid and doesn't care about anyone
[5/16/17, 5:47:32 PM] Justin: whatever snowflake

[5/16/17, 8:46:45 PM] Dan Watts: Is it ever going to end with this guy?
[5/16/17, 8:47:20 PM] Miller: Yes, January 2025

[5/16/17, 8:53:50 PM] Miller: Don't eat me
[5/16/17, 8:53:54 PM] Dan Watts: Basically a coin flip he finishes a full term?
[5/16/17, 8:54:05 PM] Steve: He doesn't get impeached
[5/16/17, 8:54:11 PM] Steve: But no way he gets reelected
[5/16/17, 8:54:20 PM] Miller: I also don't really have a strong view and certainly don't want to him to
[5/16/17, 8:54:50 PM] Miller: Just saying if he makes it 4 there's historically good odds be wins re election combined with Democrats having no candidate
[5/16/17, 8:54:57 PM] Miller: Correct
[5/16/17, 8:55:17 PM] Miller: This is the world we live in lol
[5/16/17, 8:56:39 PM] Miller: But don't underestimate his chances of winning the 2020 election, don't fall into the trap stephan does where you think he's a joke and everyone knows it, his approval rating is irrelevant because it's still over 90 percent from people who voted for him, they're still all happy with what he's been doing
[5/16/17, 8:59:11 PM] Justin: andrew cuomo on that list?
[5/16/17, 8:59:16 PM] Justin: id get my money in on cuomo or booker
[5/16/17, 8:59:59 PM] Justin: first id wait to see what this coting rights commision does
[5/16/17, 9:00:27 PM] Miller: I'm betting on the rock
[5/16/17, 9:01:22 PM] Miller: Yo jeb! How do you feel that the rock has better odds of being president than you?
[5/16/17, 9:01:27 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao @ken bone
[5/16/17, 9:02:31 PM] Dan Watts: Surprised mark Cuban isn't on there
[5/16/17, 9:02:41 PM] Miller: He's right above the rock
[5/16/17, 9:02:52 PM] Dan Watts: Oh good call
[5/16/17, 9:22:18 PM] Launchpad: Not showing Ken Bone any respek
[5/17/17, 7:47:43 AM] Miller: However, the market is starting to look two steps ahead, and according to PredicIt, Trump's odds of getting impeached in 2017 have soared from 19% to 29%, a 50% surge since the NYT story broke.
[5/17/17, 11:32:02 AM] Miller: http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/333818-sanders-misses-financial-disclosure-filing-deadline

[5/17/17, 11:37:11 AM] Justin: Ok I'm gonna read.
[5/17/17, 11:37:31 AM] Justin: Fyi I don't find it impeachable
[5/17/17, 11:37:43 AM] Justin: Considering president can declassify anything he wants
[5/17/17, 11:37:53 AM] Donk: Foe the bernie one that is
[5/17/17, 11:38:07 AM] Justin: Was gonna read obama one first.
[5/17/17, 11:38:09 AM] Donk: More impeachable is the telling comey to drop the investigation
[5/17/17, 11:39:07 AM] Justin: First question lp....did you read it?
[5/17/17, 11:39:45 AM] Justin: Literally none .....none of those 5 were leaks from obama.
[5/17/17, 11:39:53 AM] Justin: Cool story though.
[5/17/17, 11:40:57 AM] Justin: Glad I read hat article you did t read but your breitbart site emailed you w this morning
[5/17/17, 11:41:04 AM] Justin: Now onto Bernie
[5/17/17, 11:41:23 AM] Miller: cant find his tax returns, wife involved in fraud, now hesitant to show how much $ he made personally from his campaign
[5/17/17, 11:41:27 AM] Miller: yep nothing to see here
[5/17/17, 11:41:45 AM] Launchpad: Not obama but Biden - and nothing happened... same thing we can expect of Trump
[5/17/17, 11:42:22 AM] Steve: Ben Shapiro is on the up and up #fakenews
[5/17/17, 11:42:32 AM] Donk: He filed an extension
[5/17/17, 11:42:36 AM] Justin: Bernie article...so I'm sure he has made a shit ton
[5/17/17, 11:42:42 AM] Justin: He's fucken everywhere.
[5/17/17, 11:42:59 AM] Justin: Where you find that in the article?
[5/17/17, 11:43:08 AM] Donk: Tons od people file extensions
[5/17/17, 11:43:15 AM] Donk: Its a click bait articlr
[5/17/17, 11:44:32 AM] Justin: Fyi lp he seal team 6 is much deeper than that
[5/17/17, 11:46:31 AM] Miller: probably filed a delay b/c his wife is still looking for their tax return
[5/17/17, 11:46:46 AM] Justin: Schaill was working for years to uncover a secretive unit, now known as "jsac", that was operating as a shadow entity I. The intelligence community. He was close to publishing when the whitehouse announced "seal team 6" actions to kill bin laden under he purview of "jsac". So instead of a damning story of a paramilitary group operating outside us intelligence we got a sorry about heroes that killed bin laden
[5/17/17, 11:46:46 AM] Miller: aww shucks, just so hard being a regular golly middle class guy
[5/17/17, 11:48:05 AM] Donk: They may be hiding things, who knows. Regardless, the articlr is still clickbait
[5/17/17, 11:48:29 AM] Justin: So just saying. Not that I excuse the Biden naming a seal member thing
[5/17/17, 11:49:00 AM] Justin: Keep attacking the guy. I could give a fuck less about he guy. Lbj was a racist vulgar asshole.
[5/17/17, 11:49:12 AM] Launchpad: that article I posted was shared on facebook by perhaps Herman's least favorite person on the planet:  
A privileged, white, male, staunch Trump loving conservative, former Marine, turned business owner/CEO, entrepreneur
[5/17/17, 11:49:52 AM] Justin: Yeh that's a lot of privilege points
[5/17/17, 11:50:06 AM] Launchpad: nothing to do with hard work either
[5/17/17, 11:50:15 AM] Justin: To quote Steve. If you still like trump your an idiot
[5/17/17, 11:50:20 AM] Justin: You're
[5/17/17, 11:50:33 AM] Justin: I mean it could have everything to do with hard work
[5/17/17, 11:50:41 AM] Justin: He could also have just been a marine and worked hard
[5/17/17, 11:50:49 AM] Justin: Would you still be proud of him?
[5/17/17, 11:51:04 AM] Launchpad: what?
[5/17/17, 11:51:14 AM] Launchpad: if he was only a marine and not a business owner?
[5/17/17, 11:51:18 AM] Justin: Two marines. One becomes CEO one works at Starbucks
[5/17/17, 11:51:23 AM] Justin: Both work really fucken hard
[5/17/17, 11:51:32 AM] Justin: Now extrapolate.
[5/17/17, 11:51:44 AM] Justin: 100 marines. All work really fucken hard 98 work at McDonald's
[5/17/17, 11:51:50 AM] Justin: 2 become CEO
[5/17/17, 11:51:57 AM] Justin: Now extrapolate
[5/17/17, 11:52:50 AM] Launchpad: Let me set the record straight -- from now on why I say 'working hard' -- there is a difference between working with your brain, setting goals, having ambition and physically exhaustive mindless labor
[5/17/17, 11:53:00 AM] Justin: 2000 marines 1000 black 1000 white. 1980work at Starbucks. 20 are CEO. Of that 20 only 4 are black .......
[5/17/17, 11:53:08 AM] Launchpad: When I say hard work, I don't mind mindless, exhaustive labor
[5/17/17, 11:53:55 AM] Launchpad: he didn't just get lucky and become the CEO of his own comapany
[5/17/17, 11:54:27 AM] Justin: Well if you get to redefine hard work. I get to redefine lucky.
[5/17/17, 11:54:45 AM] Launchpad: no you don't
[5/17/17, 11:54:52 AM] Justin: Take that back I don't need to redefine lucky. Plenty of people work hard start business and fail
[5/17/17, 11:55:08 AM] Justin: Were they just not working hard enough?
[5/17/17, 11:55:34 AM] Justin: Something like 90% businesses fail. Obviously not hard workers.  Brain should worked better
[5/17/17, 11:55:49 AM] Justin: Luck is absolutely a large part of success
[5/17/17, 11:55:54 AM] Justin: Just as hard work is.
[5/17/17, 11:56:13 AM] Launchpad: That is absolutely true -- and nearly every successful entrepreneur will tell you stories about their failures, and how they persevere and learn from their mistakes
[5/17/17, 11:56:16 AM] Justin: But major point is Wealth in no way implies hard work.
[5/17/17, 11:56:38 AM] Launchpad: "Hard Smart Work"
[5/17/17, 11:57:11 AM] Justin: I don't even know if I dislike guy you are speaking of
[5/17/17, 11:57:12 AM] Launchpad: Like I said -- when I talk about hard work -- Im not talking about mindless labor.  That is exhausting - it is not hard
[5/17/17, 11:57:32 AM] Justin: Case by case basis, as everything in life.
[5/17/17, 11:57:34 AM] Launchpad: I would bet money on it
[5/17/17, 11:57:47 AM] Justin: Is it Eric prince ?
[5/17/17, 11:57:54 AM] Launchpad: However, I know the guy, and hes not lucky -- hes doing what we're not
[5/17/17, 11:58:26 AM] Justin: So answer to that is no. It's not Eric prince
[5/17/17, 11:58:51 AM] Launchpad: no its not Eric Prince
[5/17/17, 12:01:21 PM] Justin: Think you are misjudging  my opinion on success and my opinion on economic opportunity.  Just because your white male who grew up in a wealthy neighborhood in Long Island doesn't mean that you are t an Intelligent hard worker. I just look at the whole and wonder how many intelligent minority living in a single parent household surrounded by misery could have done just as amazing things if given that upbringing.
[5/17/17, 12:01:38 PM] Dan Watts: I think we can all agree on the following: hard work doesn't guarantee success however it gets you a lot farther the complaining and blaming your problems on other people
[5/17/17, 12:01:53 PM] Justin: Agreed.
[5/17/17, 12:01:53 PM] Scott: #hermanburn
[5/17/17, 12:02:03 PM] Justin: Although I don't think welfare equates to that above
[5/17/17, 12:03:12 PM] Justin: I mean if it is a burn I for the fuck of me can't remember the last time I blamed a single other person for my actions.
[5/17/17, 12:03:39 PM] Launchpad: I think Herman just confuses hard work with with exhausting work.  Working at Wendy's for 70 hours a week aint fucken hard.  Its exhausting, thats what it is
[5/17/17, 12:03:53 PM] Justin: I agree with the sentitment as a whole. Self responsibility is important.
[5/17/17, 12:04:35 PM] Justin: Once again to me "privilege "is about opportunity.
[5/17/17, 12:05:04 PM] Justin: When you are 18 and your taking care of your mother and not he other way around you don't have he opportunity to take risks and be creative
[5/17/17, 12:05:06 PM] Launchpad: I think you over exaggerate what its like growing up poor or in in less than ideal conditions.
[5/17/17, 12:05:27 PM] Brian Katz: You act like that's everyone's story herman
[5/17/17, 12:05:32 PM] Justin: Countless einsteins can be sick in terrible situations without the ability to show their true colors
[5/17/17, 12:05:36 PM] Launchpad: you don't make excuses for yourself -- but you make excuses for everyone else
[5/17/17, 12:06:12 PM] Launchpad: well if they were so fucken smart, they'd figure out a way.  Write on Quora perhaps?
[5/17/17, 12:06:49 PM] Justin: For one katz the CEO isn't everyone's story either.
[5/17/17, 12:07:25 PM] Justin: It takes very particular conditions to have that opportunity and there are potholes all along the way.  Economics being the largest determative factor
[5/17/17, 12:07:58 PM] Brian Katz: Drive is probably a huge factor more than anything
[5/17/17, 12:08:07 PM] Justin: I know hat poor people can't afford schooling. When they afford schooling they need to work while at school.
[5/17/17, 12:08:11 PM] Brian Katz: Cream rises to the top herman
[5/17/17, 12:08:20 PM] Justin: Lol
[5/17/17, 12:08:28 PM] Justin: Yeh Donald trump is cream
[5/17/17, 12:08:42 PM] Brian Katz: Guys the president
[5/17/17, 12:08:48 PM] Justin: Saudi princes are cream
[5/17/17, 12:08:57 PM] Brian Katz: He made it happen when everyone laughed at
[5/17/17, 12:08:59 PM] Brian Katz: Him
[5/17/17, 12:09:02 PM] Justin: Put is cream
[5/17/17, 12:09:06 PM] Justin: Putin
[5/17/17, 12:09:22 PM] Justin: Koch brothers Cream
[5/17/17, 12:09:29 PM] Justin: Walton children cream
[5/17/17, 12:09:31 PM] Brian Katz: He did some shady shit in Russia to be where he is. Way more than the rest
[5/17/17, 12:10:09 PM] Brian Katz: Koch brothers don't have to do shit they have so much dough, but they choose to shape the world the way they see fit
[5/17/17, 12:10:10 PM] Justin: Putin only one there that earned it. THat is true
[5/17/17, 12:10:46 PM] Brian Katz: If you had Koch brothers dough, what would you do?
[5/17/17, 12:10:49 PM] Justin: Yeh so why use analogies like the crime rises to the top. Wealth breeds wealth is a more accurate analysis.
[5/17/17, 12:10:55 PM] Justin: Cream*
[5/17/17, 12:11:15 PM] Justin: Capitalism is a system designed to give capital an advantage over labor.
[5/17/17, 12:11:23 PM] Justin: Government determines that relationship.
[5/17/17, 12:11:34 PM] Brian Katz: If you were given a million dollars would you make it into more wealth herman? Or squander it?
[5/17/17, 12:12:13 PM] Justin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0n7vTLz1U
[5/17/17, 12:12:52 PM] Brian Katz: How many lotto jackpot winners go broke? They should have enough wealth to change their families lives forever.
[5/17/17, 12:13:56 PM] Justin: its a fair analysis
[5/17/17, 12:14:11 PM] Justin: perhaps has to do with smaple size of people who are gambling on lotto
[5/17/17, 12:14:46 PM] Justin: I also wonder how much that has changed recently
[5/17/17, 12:14:52 PM] Brian Katz: So you're a gambler. If you won the lotto, would you go broke in a few years?
[5/17/17, 12:14:54 PM] Justin: financail advise is alot more common place
[5/17/17, 12:15:09 PM] Brian Katz: People ain't hearing that
[5/17/17, 12:15:14 PM] Donk: Yeah, you are discounting the support system that comes with inhereiting a shit ton of money vs winning it in the lotto
[5/17/17, 12:15:18 PM] Launchpad: we all saw what happened when herman had 100k in his pockets in binghamton
[5/17/17, 12:15:33 PM] Brian Katz: He earned it?
[5/17/17, 12:15:34 PM] Launchpad: thanks for the red bulls & vodka btw
[5/17/17, 12:15:45 PM] Justin: np
[5/17/17, 12:15:45 PM] Donk: Don't forget cherry wheat
[5/17/17, 12:15:48 PM] Donk: Tbose too
[5/17/17, 12:15:55 PM] Launchpad: I would say he did, but he'll probably tell you he got lucky
[5/17/17, 12:15:58 PM] Brian Katz: Cherry wheat is for pussies
[5/17/17, 12:15:59 PM] Justin: those bills were the same equivalent to me dirnking alone in nyv
[5/17/17, 12:16:05 PM] Justin: just saying
[5/17/17, 12:16:09 PM] Brian Katz: I didn't mean the question mark
[5/17/17, 12:16:22 PM] Justin: 130$ to bye 6 people drinks for a night...... good old days
[5/17/17, 12:17:24 PM] Justin: i mean if you want to use my example fine.... clearly my losing my bankroll had nothing to do with extravagant spending and everything to do with the government shutting down poker and variance
[5/17/17, 12:17:58 PM] Brian Katz: Herman people can fail, and blame others and a ton of variables of why they failed, but they only need to look in the mirror.
[5/17/17, 12:18:02 PM] Justin: was young and dumb perhaps also, but I mean really wouldnt have changed much if I had decided to go down in stakes as opposed to up in stkaes
[5/17/17, 12:18:12 PM] Justin: lol katz
[5/17/17, 12:18:40 PM] Brian Katz: Why have you failed herman? You were born into white privilege?
[5/17/17, 12:18:58 PM] Justin: once again katz if you cant define the word, im not gonna bother to explain this again
[5/17/17, 12:19:13 PM] Justin: its becuase i didnt look in the mirror obviously
[5/17/17, 12:19:19 PM] Brian Katz: Agreed
[5/17/17, 12:19:22 PM] Justin: should looked in mirror maybe i shoudl got muirrors all over room
[5/17/17, 12:19:24 PM] Justin: kept looking
[5/17/17, 12:19:32 PM] Justin: think that might got job done
[5/17/17, 12:19:41 PM] Brian Katz: Or you could be sarcastic, I'm sure that'll help
[5/17/17, 12:20:10 PM] Launchpad: the point is you can get down on yourself, or you can pick yourself up and move one
[5/17/17, 12:20:12 PM] Launchpad: **on
[5/17/17, 12:20:13 PM] Brian Katz: Why are you still playing poker?
[5/17/17, 12:20:26 PM] Brian Katz: Is there a future in it?
[5/17/17, 12:20:28 PM] Justin: yeh someone who has lived his life in sarcasim is tellign me sarcaism is enemy of success
[5/17/17, 12:20:43 PM] Justin: do you listen to what you are even saying>

[5/17/17, 12:20:54 PM] Justin: how that work out for you up till this point?
[5/17/17, 12:21:04 PM] Justin: semeed fine
[5/17/17, 12:21:11 PM] Brian Katz: It wasn't working very well.
[5/17/17, 12:21:54 PM] Brian Katz: I was grossly over weight. Stagnated at my job. Was going no where in my relationship. Spent money stupidly
[5/17/17, 12:22:14 PM] Justin: sarcsim did all that?
[5/17/17, 12:22:19 PM] Justin: and mirror changed all that?
[5/17/17, 12:22:26 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah, in a way
[5/17/17, 12:22:59 PM] Justin: ok so lets say you didnt have your grandfathers business
[5/17/17, 12:23:01 PM] Justin: give me ideas
[5/17/17, 12:23:05 PM] Justin: work hard right now as lp says
[5/17/17, 12:23:09 PM] Justin: what would you do
[5/17/17, 12:23:16 PM] Brian Katz: My path would have been way different
[5/17/17, 12:23:25 PM] Justin: what would you do now
[5/17/17, 12:23:28 PM] Justin: this is new katz
[5/17/17, 12:23:36 PM] Brian Katz: I wouldn't have been the person I was. It's hard to say what I would have been
[5/17/17, 12:23:38 PM] Justin: and lp defines hard work as brain power----give me ideas for scuess
[5/17/17, 12:23:58 PM] Brian Katz: Follow what Fienberg is dojng.

[5/17/17, 12:24:10 PM] Brian Katz: You have three friends in law
[5/17/17, 12:24:34 PM] Brian Katz: I would have to. I'd need a better job
[5/17/17, 12:24:50 PM] Justin: im not going into law, already decided what im doing
[5/17/17, 12:24:55 PM] Brian Katz: Why didn't you take the cheese job
[5/17/17, 12:25:01 PM] Brian Katz: What are you doing?

[5/17/17, 12:25:57 PM] Justin: cant play poker from ny.

[5/17/17, 12:27:13 PM] Brian Katz: You were playing poker as of two years ago in ny
[5/17/17, 12:27:19 PM] Justin: ok...
[5/17/17, 12:27:25 PM] Justin: you were old katz as of two years ago
[5/17/17, 12:27:28 PM] Justin: see how that happens
[5/17/17, 12:27:29 PM] Brian Katz: Then drop that. It's going nowhere
[5/17/17, 12:27:29 PM] Miller: why not invent a new kind of poker that is legal in NY?
[5/17/17, 12:27:31 PM] Miller: boom
[5/17/17, 12:27:42 PM] Justin: its legal in NJ
[5/17/17, 12:27:50 PM] Brian Katz: Yes only difference is I moved on
[5/17/17, 12:27:57 PM] Justin: 50/50 to be legal in NY soon
[5/17/17, 12:28:44 PM] Miller: should just be the next bernie sanders
[5/17/17, 12:28:53 PM] Miller: complain a lot about inequality and get super rich b/c of it
[5/17/17, 12:29:00 PM] Justin: not a bad idea, too much incriminating social media pcitures though
[5/17/17, 12:29:03 PM] Miller: youre already 1/2 jewish
[5/17/17, 12:29:09 PM] Justin: would be cut off at the start
[5/17/17, 12:29:42 PM] Miller: that is true bernie is lucky the internet (or electricity) wasnt invented when he was growing up

[5/17/17, 12:32:24 PM] Justin: let your grandchildren be the next koch's
[5/17/17, 12:32:33 PM] Launchpad: Ill bet you $10,000 that San Diego will be around
[5/17/17, 12:32:42 PM] Miller: ill take that bet
[5/17/17, 12:32:45 PM] Justin: ill have to look at the predictive maps

[5/17/17, 12:34:00 PM] Miller: plus by then 10k will be like $150 today and/or trump will probably have started a nuclear war by then
[5/17/17, 12:34:01 PM] Scott: So Herman what are u gonna do?

[5/17/17, 12:37:48 PM] Scott: No really Herman what are ur plans?
[5/17/17, 12:38:02 PM] Launchpad: I think you spend too much time getting sucked into the nonstop negativity of the 24 hour news cycle that its warping your view of the planet.  They need you emotionally invested for their clicks, but it doesn't improve your life in any way.  Its why I stopped caring about the news & politics -- its the same story over and over again
[5/17/17, 12:39:29 PM] Justin: no my brain allows me to  distinguish between things, evolution is rather amazing
[5/17/17, 12:39:47 PM] Justin: id say this chat group takes up 10x more time than the news cycle
[5/17/17, 12:39:57 PM] Justin: kinda like quora and these chat groups likely do for you
[5/17/17, 12:40:17 PM] Justin: like ive put off lunch and coffee for an hour now
[5/17/17, 12:40:38 PM] Justin: lol

[5/17/17, 12:41:00 PM] Miller: should do it while eating those snack wraps
[5/17/17, 12:41:05 PM] Justin: deep reflection and enligtenment will ensue
[5/17/17, 12:41:08 PM] Miller: make sure nothing gets in your beard
[5/17/17, 12:42:39 PM] Launchpad: I will actually agree with you that this chat is not a positive or healthy place
[5/17/17, 12:43:13 PM] Dan Watts: Whose fault is that?
[5/17/17, 12:43:23 PM] Miller: @13478047760 ?
[5/17/17, 12:43:37 PM] Launchpad: all of us
[5/17/17, 12:43:38 PM] Miller: (couldnt resist dont attack me)
[5/17/17, 12:44:14 PM] Miller: i think its your fault launchpad, take some personal responsibility
[5/17/17, 12:44:43 PM] Launchpad: Now if you want to see a bunch of badass dudes coming together in the interest of a common goal, join Smash Bros chat
[5/17/17, 12:44:53 PM] Justin: yeh chat group sucks
[5/17/17, 12:45:07 PM] Justin: my temporary hiatus was nice
[5/17/17, 12:45:11 PM] Justin: feinberg got it right
[5/17/17, 12:45:18 PM] Launchpad: thats cause we're mostly a bunch of troll faced snarky dickheads
[5/17/17, 12:45:23 PM] Justin: agreed

[5/17/17, 12:49:07 PM] Justin: yeh thats next step...healthy eating
[5/17/17, 12:50:06 PM] Justin: joia is claiming halal chicken doesnt have any steroids or hormones and is same price, so i might be becoming more muslim than jewish
[5/17/17, 12:50:22 PM] Miller: is it like kosher?
[5/17/17, 12:50:27 PM] Justin: yeh same shit
[5/17/17, 12:50:32 PM] Justin: but you kno w jews overcharge
[5/17/17, 12:50:34 PM] Miller: i would be trying to get more steroids
[5/17/17, 12:50:54 PM] Justin: yeh gotta get t levels up
[5/17/17, 12:51:07 PM] Miller: just eat some brazil nuts on the side
[5/17/17, 12:51:45 PM] Brian Katz: Halal chicken is "the bomb" I keed I keed
[5/17/17, 12:51:57 PM] Launchpad: yes guys, cause diet has no effect on hormone levels
[5/17/17, 12:52:08 PM] Launchpad: diet doesn't effect anything really
[5/17/17, 12:55:38 PM] Justin: still never got that marine guys name
[5/17/17, 12:55:53 PM] Launchpad: why do you care?

[5/17/17, 12:56:43 PM] Justin: notorious brother of betsy devos
[5/17/17, 12:57:32 PM] Miller: notorious 1/2 of the subject matter of the classic smash song 2 princes
[5/17/17, 12:57:50 PM] Justin: thats another group of wealthy children the world would be better off without
[5/17/17, 12:58:46 PM] Justin: punning-- he s a bottle full of kryptonite
[5/17/17, 12:59:16 PM] Launchpad: how about - just some guy I know?
[5/17/17, 12:59:39 PM] Launchpad: no one famous
[5/17/17, 12:59:45 PM] Justin: damn is he more than that?
[5/17/17, 12:59:58 PM] Launchpad: nope
[5/17/17, 1:00:02 PM] Launchpad: pretty pathetic tbh
[5/17/17, 1:00:09 PM] Justin: whatever as long as hes not billy than i have no facebook comments to make
[5/17/17, 7:27:32 PM] Launchpad: looks like bitcoin is finally in a bubble: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-i-trade-bitcoin-for-a-living-tickets-34525239922
[5/17/17, 11:07:55 PM] Dan Watts: Independent prosecutor appointed to investigate? Definitely the same as Obama @16195657200
[5/18/17, 8:10:06 AM] Brian Katz: Kind of looks like herman
[5/18/17, 8:10:49 AM] Steve: I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks either, so, maybe?
[5/18/17, 8:34:58 AM] Brian Katz: Chris Cornell of soundgarden died
[5/18/17, 8:52:12 AM] Steve: Roger ailes died
[5/18/17, 8:52:16 AM] Steve: Good riddance
[5/18/17, 9:17:09 AM] Miller: Conor McGregor confirms signed contract to fight Floyd Mayweather
[5/18/17, 9:17:19 AM] Miller: sounds like this stupid fight is actually going to happen
[5/18/17, 9:17:37 AM] Miller: get ready for unreasonable levels of hype, $100 ppv and an absolutely terrible fight
[5/18/17, 9:18:52 AM] Brian Katz: I'm not paying to see Floyd fight again
[5/18/17, 9:19:06 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[5/18/17, 9:20:43 AM] Dan Watts: üáÆüá™ üçÄ üáÆüá™
[5/18/17, 12:21:27 PM] Miller: damn some dude drove a truck through (the sidewalk) of times sq
[5/18/17, 12:21:36 PM] Miller: stay safe out there (and always avoid times sq)
[5/18/17, 12:25:13 PM] Justin: Definitely Muslim terrorist
[5/18/17, 12:26:11 PM] Justin: At least that's what yahoo comments section is saying. They are also upset that this wouldnt have happened if obama just said the words.
[5/18/17, 12:26:26 PM] Donk: I doubt its a terror attack
[5/18/17, 12:26:31 PM] Justin: I think it wouldn't have happened if New Yorkers did t jaywalk like assholes all the time
[5/18/17, 12:26:59 PM] Donk: The driving throuhh crowd attacks have generally been with trucks and during major parades
[5/18/17, 12:27:01 PM] Justin: But hey that's just an observation from someone who actually drives in ny
[5/18/17, 12:27:13 PM] Donk: Not on a sedan on a weekday morning
[5/18/17, 12:27:27 PM] Justin: Yeh it's a sedan hat crashed into a pole. My money on someone walked in front of him and he swerved
[5/18/17, 12:27:44 PM] Miller: you know there are no cars allowed at all in that part?
[5/18/17, 12:27:47 PM] Donk: Yeah, jaywalkers are annoying when driving, pisses me off too....and then i jaywall whole walking
[5/18/17, 12:27:51 PM] Miller: the car drove through a pedestrian area
[5/18/17, 12:27:56 PM] Miller: this was not a jaywalking issue
[5/18/17, 12:28:54 PM] Donk: I just heard it was somw guy who was drunk and high with 2 previous duis
[5/18/17, 12:28:58 PM] Justin: In fairness a lot of the pedestrian area is intermixed with intersections
[5/18/17, 12:30:05 PM] Justin: And video I'm seein is people injured in front of cars at an intersection.
[5/18/17, 12:30:23 PM] Miller: news said they drove onto a sidewalk
[5/18/17, 12:30:33 PM] Miller: if the ppl were jaywalking would have been safer ironically
[5/18/17, 12:31:41 PM] Justin: Just saying between texting and driving and nyers walking in front of cars across intersections in complete disregard, not shocked.
[5/18/17, 12:41:09 PM] Justin: http://nerdist.com/arrow-stephen-amell-american-ninja-warrior-course-red-nose-day/
[5/18/17, 12:41:38 PM] Miller: BREAKING IN STATEN ISLAND, NYC: 5 People just struck by vehicle; 1 DOA, 3 likely to die / very critical. Broadway & Castleton Ave.
[5/18/17, 12:41:38 PM] Miller: weird
[5/18/17, 12:43:30 PM] Miller: guys the man
[5/18/17, 12:46:42 PM] Dan Watts: Broadway and castelton is not far from my house
[5/18/17, 12:46:53 PM] Dan Watts: Crazy
[5/18/17, 12:48:24 PM] Miller: guess everyone should just stay indoors today
[5/18/17, 1:09:49 PM] Justin: Yeh I mean Idk the numbers but it's probably a " if a tree falls in the forest" type scenario.
[5/18/17, 2:06:48 PM] Steve: Looking more and more like a drunk driver
[5/18/17, 3:18:17 PM] Dan Watts: James Harden the only unanimous first team all NBA selection
[5/18/17, 3:18:30 PM] Dan Watts: precursor to MVP?
[5/18/17, 3:18:44 PM] Scott: #hibachithrowdown
[5/18/17, 3:21:51 PM] Steve: If he wins I will literally never watch another basketball again
[5/18/17, 3:21:58 PM] Steve: I'm not saying it isn't possible
[5/18/17, 3:22:03 PM] Steve: It would just be stupid
[5/18/17, 3:23:01 PM] Donk: Counting stats arent everything
[5/18/17, 3:23:16 PM] Donk: Also 0 chance you never watching basketball again
[5/18/17, 3:23:40 PM] Donk: Never watch again that is
[5/18/17, 3:26:35 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/18/17, 3:26:41 PM] Steve: Ou still are on that counting stats
[5/18/17, 3:26:47 PM] Steve: It's actually incredible
[5/18/17, 3:27:05 PM] Donk: Its incredible to me that you ignore all stats besides 3
[5/18/17, 3:27:09 PM] Steve: You admit that without Westbrook OKC is a bottom 5 team in the league
[5/18/17, 3:27:10 PM] Donk: But here we are
[5/18/17, 3:27:23 PM] Donk: I do agree with that
[5/18/17, 3:27:24 PM] Steve: And that the rockets are probably a playoff team without harden
[5/18/17, 3:27:33 PM] Donk: Maybe
[5/18/17, 3:27:34 PM] Steve: Which is literally the definition of MVP
[5/18/17, 3:27:36 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/18/17, 3:27:38 PM] Donk: Is it?
[5/18/17, 3:27:39 PM] Steve: Ok
[5/18/17, 3:27:51 PM] Steve: Most valuable player to their team
[5/18/17, 3:27:54 PM] Donk: Making the playoffs is mvp?
[5/18/17, 3:27:58 PM] Steve: I would hunk
[5/18/17, 3:28:01 PM] Donk: Or most valuable player
[5/18/17, 3:28:05 PM] Donk: Two different things
[5/18/17, 3:28:10 PM] Steve: Making your team a contender is part of being an MVP
[5/18/17, 3:28:18 PM] Steve: And Westbrook has
[5/18/17, 3:28:23 PM] Steve: All by himself
[5/18/17, 3:28:33 PM] Steve: Literally did things that have never been done
[5/18/17, 3:28:40 PM] Donk: We dont need to do this again
[5/18/17, 3:28:44 PM] Steve: Stats I listen on detail
[5/18/17, 3:28:52 PM] Donk: We have argued this already, i know what your pointe are
[5/18/17, 3:29:00 PM] Steve: And yet your point is: "he stat padded"
[5/18/17, 3:29:01 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/18/17, 3:29:07 PM] Donk: He did stat pad
[5/18/17, 3:29:13 PM] Donk: Thats undeniable
[5/18/17, 3:29:13 PM] Steve: Right
[5/18/17, 3:29:23 PM] Steve: He didn't try and win games by doing everything
[5/18/17, 3:29:26 PM] Steve: He stat padded
[5/18/17, 3:29:28 PM] Donk: I watched it happen in multiple games down the stretch
[5/18/17, 3:29:43 PM] Steve: He led the league in triple doubles because he wanted the stats
[5/18/17, 3:29:52 PM] Steve: Not the wins
[5/18/17, 3:29:54 PM] Steve: The stats
[5/18/17, 3:30:13 PM] Miller: he clearly stat padded
[5/18/17, 3:30:16 PM] Donk: He stat padded at the ebd to nake sure he averaged it
[5/18/17, 3:30:21 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/18/17, 3:30:22 PM] Steve: Ok
[5/18/17, 3:30:29 PM] Steve: It's not like he did it to win games
[5/18/17, 3:30:32 PM] Steve: Your right
[5/18/17, 3:30:36 PM] Donk: He didnt at times
[5/18/17, 3:30:39 PM] Steve: He was out their for stat padding
[5/18/17, 3:30:43 PM] Miller: do you think if lebron went out and intentionally tried to average a triple double for the season he couldnt?
[5/18/17, 3:30:46 PM] Miller: harden couldnt?
[5/18/17, 3:30:48 PM] Donk: Not every min of every game
[5/18/17, 3:30:55 PM] Miller: if that was their focus and their teams supported that goal?
[5/18/17, 3:30:58 PM] Donk: But it happened
[5/18/17, 3:31:07 PM] Steve: That want westbrooks focus
[5/18/17, 3:31:10 PM] Steve: That's the point
[5/18/17, 3:31:12 PM] Miller: is a triple double 1000% better than 30/8/8
[5/18/17, 3:31:13 PM] Miller: apparently
[5/18/17, 3:31:14 PM] Steve: He wanted to win games
[5/18/17, 3:31:33 PM] Steve: And I'm sure if he has other players who were actually good he wouldn't have to do that
[5/18/17, 3:31:36 PM] Donk: Of course he wanted to win,  no one is say8ng he didnt
[5/18/17, 3:31:44 PM] Donk: But he also stat padded
[5/18/17, 3:31:47 PM] Steve: But his roster, as noted by many, is one of the worst in the league
[5/18/17, 3:31:49 PM] Dan Watts: i don't think rockets are a playoff team without harden
[5/18/17, 3:32:05 PM] Donk: Yeah it would bw close foe houston
[5/18/17, 3:32:06 PM] Steve: So he had no choice but to try and do everythiny, every night
[5/18/17, 3:32:18 PM] Steve: Rockets would be a playoff team
[5/18/17, 3:32:18 PM] Dan Watts: also thunder have one of the biggest teams in the NBA and i think were top offensive rebounding team
[5/18/17, 3:32:25 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/18/17, 3:32:27 PM] Steve: Watts
[5/18/17, 3:32:34 PM] Dan Watts: that's a fucking fact man look it up
[5/18/17, 3:32:37 PM] Miller: the idea that the MVP discussion is not even a discussion b/c westbrook averaged a triple double is absurd though
[5/18/17, 3:32:42 PM] Steve: If you watched the thunder when Westbrook was on the bench you saw what they were
[5/18/17, 3:33:06 PM] Steve: Great do they did one thing well
[5/18/17, 3:33:18 PM] Steve: I'm sure that would have won them no games without Westbrook
[5/18/17, 3:33:22 PM] Dan Watts: that's a very important thing
[5/18/17, 3:33:32 PM] Dan Watts: especially when russ is shooting 50 times a night
[5/18/17, 3:33:36 PM] Steve: Not if you can't make baskets after an offensive rebound
[5/18/17, 3:33:54 PM] Steve: Yes, but the pint is Westbrook has to mAke those shots
[5/18/17, 3:33:57 PM] Donk: Steve doesnt believe in efficency
[5/18/17, 3:34:02 PM] Steve: Offensive rebounds by themselves are useless
[5/18/17, 3:34:05 PM] Donk: Or usage rate
[5/18/17, 3:34:06 PM] Dan Watts: many teams would kill to have OKC's size
[5/18/17, 3:34:12 PM] Steve: I believe in those
[5/18/17, 3:34:12 PM] Donk: Advanced stats are nonsense
[5/18/17, 3:34:25 PM] Donk: Only pts, assits and rebounds matter
[5/18/17, 3:34:28 PM] Steve: But I also believe a player who has no one else on his roster has to do what Westbrook did
[5/18/17, 3:34:31 PM] Steve: Which is everything
[5/18/17, 3:34:34 PM] Steve: Not stat padding
[5/18/17, 3:34:46 PM] Steve: I never said any of those things
[5/18/17, 3:34:56 PM] Dan Watts: what did he do? get the 6 seed in the playoffs and loose 4-1 to the aforementioned rockets?
[5/18/17, 3:35:08 PM] Steve: I just think it's absurd you think he stat padded instead of doing what he had to do to reach 47 wins
[5/18/17, 3:35:38 PM] Steve: The same team that got beat 4-1 the next round?
[5/18/17, 3:35:51 PM] Steve: What do teams get for losing in the es tiene conference semis?
[5/18/17, 3:35:51 PM] Dan Watts: they lost 4-2, and they advanced
[5/18/17, 3:35:56 PM] Steve: Eastern
[5/18/17, 3:36:02 PM] Steve: Do they get a Sacco?
[5/18/17, 3:36:06 PM] Steve: Pat on the back?
[5/18/17, 3:36:11 PM] Dan Watts: they were the third seed in the west and they won a series, against the team you are lobbying for
[5/18/17, 3:36:27 PM] Steve: I'm not lobbying for the thunder
[5/18/17, 3:36:31 PM] Steve: The opposite
[5/18/17, 3:36:37 PM] Steve: I think they are awful
[5/18/17, 3:36:49 PM] Steve: And the fact the team won 47 games is a miracle
[5/18/17, 3:37:16 PM] Donk: The stat padding im talking about was late in the season, when they would be down 20, and harden would have an open lane to the basket for an easy layup but instead would kick out for a 3 to get an assist
[5/18/17, 3:37:32 PM] Donk: Thinga like that happened many times down the stretch
[5/18/17, 3:37:59 PM] Donk: Or the whole team ignoring rebounds so that westbrook could run down half the court to pick up an extra board
[5/18/17, 3:38:37 PM] Dan Watts: very lame
[5/18/17, 3:38:44 PM] Donk: Those type of plays arw clearly stat padding
[5/18/17, 3:38:49 PM] Miller: http://newsok.com/article/5544610
[5/18/17, 3:38:50 PM] Donk: And do not help teams win
[5/18/17, 3:39:09 PM] Dan Watts: FAKE NEWS
[5/18/17, 3:39:09 PM] Miller: Lowe: "If you don't think Russell Westbrook is stat padding his rebounds, you're just blindfully ignorant or not watching.

"He is stat padding his rebounds. So if you really care enough about 2 defensive rebounds to make that the deciding factor in who you vote for, more power to you. If you vote for Westbrook, you should not do it because of the triple double. Period."

Lowe then clarified that he does believe Westbrook is worthy of the MVP award, but for reasons other than the triple-double average.

"I might vote for Russell Westbrook. I'm not going to tell you which way I'm leaning, but I might," Lowe said. "It doesn't have to matter to you that he is averaging a triple double. That's not why you should vote for him.
[5/18/17, 3:39:23 PM] Miller: but then again what does ESPN's senior NBA writer Zach Lowe
[5/18/17, 3:39:25 PM] Miller: really know
[5/18/17, 3:40:20 PM] Donk: Its a witch hunt against triple doubles
[5/18/17, 3:40:25 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzHjfcxDgC8
[5/18/17, 3:40:29 PM] Miller: lol watch this video
[5/18/17, 3:41:03 PM] Donk: Ha, yeah thats exactly what i was talking about
[5/18/17, 3:41:13 PM] Donk: The other players ignore the ball
[5/18/17, 3:41:50 PM] Miller: the voice-over stats about un-contested rebounds etc.. are jarring as well
[5/18/17, 3:56:03 PM] Donk: Its not only harden though. I think arguements can be made for both lebron and leonard too
[5/18/17, 3:56:26 PM] Dan Watts: absolutely
[5/18/17, 3:56:32 PM] Miller: lebron could win it every yr and you dont need to justify it
[5/18/17, 3:56:41 PM] Miller: hes easily the best player on the planet
[5/18/17, 4:04:33 PM] Donk: Just checked the forecast and wunderground let me know that while its 95 out, because of the wind chill, it only feels like 92
[5/18/17, 4:04:58 PM] Miller: its 95 out? goddamn
[5/18/17, 4:05:09 PM] Miller: way too hot to be getting hit by cars
[5/18/17, 4:05:09 PM] Dan Watts: my car read 98 before
[5/18/17, 4:05:43 PM] Steve: Who wants to see the new pirates movie ok the 25th of may at 7 pm

[5/19/17, 11:27:18 AM] Brian Katz: Our positive love fest is way more obnoxious, then you and steve blowing each other over your liberal agenda everyday.
[5/19/17, 11:28:15 AM] Kiyoon: Slow day today
[5/19/17, 11:28:38 AM] Launchpad: thats cute, do you live in San Diego too?
[5/19/17, 11:35:38 AM] Justin: hey @15166335046 its your bernie sanders argument on steroids.  While I don't agree with everything Oliver says, should i now stop watching his show?https://www.facebook.com/RTAmerica/videos/10154434902681366/
[5/19/17, 11:37:42 AM] Donk: That chick sounds so happy to take john Oliver down a peg
[5/19/17, 11:37:49 AM] Donk: Talk about a shit eating grin
[5/19/17, 11:37:51 AM] Justin: i fucken hate her
[5/19/17, 11:38:02 AM] Justin: propaganda spitting machine
[5/19/17, 11:39:35 AM] Justin: actually liked RT before i started seeing her clips
[5/19/17, 11:41:04 AM] Justin: althgouh Oliver response "‚ÄúThe apartment was purchased through a trust, solely for privacy reasons ‚Äì the trust confers no tax benefit whatsoever. As for the 421a tax exemption, the rate at which the city taxes the building in which Mr. Oliver lives was the result of the building developers applying for that exemption before construction years before he took up residence. It was not the result of any action or decision taken by Mr. Oliver.‚Äù"
[5/19/17, 11:44:50 AM] Launchpad: Boycott John Oliver!
[5/19/17, 11:45:01 AM] Launchpad: Boycott Tim Allen!
[5/19/17, 11:45:07 AM] Launchpad: Boycott ABC!
[5/19/17, 11:45:29 AM] Launchpad: Boycott Steven Colbert!
[5/19/17, 11:49:13 AM] Justin: already crossed off boycott roger ailes
[5/19/17, 11:50:10 AM] Miller: see i dont consider people using the law to pay as little taxes as possible a loophole and im not sure john oliver has ever made it a platform to go out and try to shame people who pay lower %s so he can do w/e the fuck he wants, that would not be hypocritical
[5/19/17, 11:51:48 AM] Justin: jon oliver talks about tax loopehoels and income inequality often
[5/19/17, 11:52:05 AM] Miller: he the host of a show
[5/19/17, 11:52:22 AM] Launchpad: not using loopholes you have that are available is just dumb
[5/19/17, 11:52:28 AM] Launchpad: paying any taxes you don't need to is dumb
[5/19/17, 11:52:35 AM] Miller: couldnt agree more
[5/19/17, 11:52:41 AM] Justin: adn what law did bernie breka exactly?
[5/19/17, 11:52:44 AM] Launchpad: you'll have nothing to show for the extra taxes you paid
[5/19/17, 11:52:48 AM] Miller: i didnt say he broke a law
[5/19/17, 11:53:04 AM] Launchpad: the laws of Hippocrates
[5/19/17, 11:53:16 AM] Justin: so jon oliver hasnt become rich talking about issues of income inequality and overall inequality in america?
[5/19/17, 11:53:32 AM] Miller: what i said was if you are going to personally campaign on taxes and how all these corporations and rich people are using all these tax loopholes to pay lower taxes you better not have one deduction on your taxes
[5/19/17, 11:53:44 AM] Justin: why?
[5/19/17, 11:54:22 AM] Justin: so you can talk about income ineaulity and an unjust tax system....and cheat it...but running ofr office where you could actually change the tax system, then you can't?
[5/19/17, 11:54:28 AM] Miller: b/c the people he is complaining about are just doing the same thing
[5/19/17, 11:54:32 AM] Justin: are you claiming jon Oliver is an acotr playing a role?
[5/19/17, 11:54:33 AM] Launchpad: he became rich by leveraging his white privilege into power. It would be literally impossible to do what he did had be belonged to a different race
[5/19/17, 11:54:37 AM] Miller: he wasnt complaining about the system
[5/19/17, 11:54:50 AM] Miller: he was complaining about specific companies
[5/19/17, 11:55:00 AM] Justin: it links baove to what scott said
[5/19/17, 11:55:01 AM] Miller: who were just doing the exact same thing he was
[5/19/17, 11:55:11 AM] Justin: your an asshole if your not tkaign advantage of any tax loopholes
[5/19/17, 11:55:29 AM] Miller: if you dont see that as hypocritical then idk what to tell you
[5/19/17, 11:55:32 AM] Justin: doesnt mean you wouldnt change those loopholes
[5/19/17, 11:55:45 AM] Justin: so if he said I tkae advntage of these loopholes
[5/19/17, 11:55:52 AM] Justin: would it then be hypoctirical?
[5/19/17, 11:57:35 AM] Miller: no i dont care if he says he does it or not
[5/19/17, 11:57:49 AM] Miller: he could have stuck to complaining about the system, thats totally different
[5/19/17, 11:58:02 AM] Miller: when you start calling out people or companies for taking advantage of that system is where it becomes hypocritical
[5/19/17, 11:58:11 AM] Justin: ok i got it so you cant claim taxes are unfair and benefit the rich, if your rich and benefit from taxes
[5/19/17, 11:58:12 AM] Miller: its mind bottling you cannot see that distinction
[5/19/17, 11:58:22 AM] Justin: even though that is literally implied in the statement
[5/19/17, 11:58:55 AM] Justin: taxes are unfair and benefit the rich-----im rich---therefore taxes benefit me...thats the logic of the statemetn
[5/19/17, 11:59:00 AM] Miller: the point is keeping it generic vs specific
[5/19/17, 11:59:09 AM] Miller: so if you were competing in a power lifting competition
[5/19/17, 11:59:12 AM] Miller: and youre taking steroids
[5/19/17, 11:59:23 AM] Miller: and you are out there personally calling out other people for cheating
[5/19/17, 11:59:26 AM] Miller: and taking steroids
[5/19/17, 11:59:32 AM] Miller: that is not hypocritical of you?
[5/19/17, 11:59:53 AM] Justin: except steroids effect the end goal of the competitoin
[5/19/17, 11:59:57 AM] Miller: the difference being if you were out there complaining about the lack of drug testing in competitions, that is something totally different
[5/19/17, 12:00:15 PM] Justin: how much bernie pays in taxes dont effec this presidency..
[5/19/17, 12:00:37 PM] Miller: i disagree, it does effect his message
[5/19/17, 12:00:53 PM] Justin: also in your scenario i'm not given any power postiion to change said rules
[5/19/17, 12:00:54 PM] Miller: im sure if you polled people i would not be the only person to find this hypocritical
[5/19/17, 12:01:05 PM] Miller: its why people wanted his taxes released (still waiting for that)
[5/19/17, 12:01:08 PM] Justin: probably right
[5/19/17, 12:01:19 PM] Justin: although im sure it splits down lines mostly of who liked bernie and who doesnt beforehand
[5/19/17, 12:01:58 PM] Justin: most people who like bernie, like bernie's ideas.  Most people who dislike bernie dislike bernies ideas.  Therefore its an easy scapegoat to just call him a hypoctire
[5/19/17, 12:02:32 PM] Miller: http://investmentwatchblog.com/bernie-sanders-calls-out-18-corrupt-ceos-for-stealing-trillions-outsourcing-jobs-and-evading-taxes/
[5/19/17, 12:02:45 PM] Miller: @16318489683 should send bernie a mirror
[5/19/17, 12:02:51 PM] Justin: meanwhile he just ran for the largest office in america, in a time where corporations own speech, and almost won the democratic party ticket with no corporate influence
[5/19/17, 12:04:31 PM] Justin: honest question to get to the root, do you think he would have raised taxes and closed loopholes in his budget?
[5/19/17, 12:15:12 PM] Miller: almost certainly, or would have tried to
[5/19/17, 12:15:29 PM] Justin: Son then we agree.
[5/19/17, 12:15:43 PM] Justin: I guess he's hypocrite in theory
[5/19/17, 12:15:54 PM] Justin: Could care less
[5/19/17, 12:16:01 PM] Miller: thats fine
[5/19/17, 12:16:09 PM] Miller: it bothers me but i didnt like the guy before
[5/19/17, 12:16:45 PM] Justin: Fair
[5/19/17, 12:27:54 PM] Miller: holy shit
[5/19/17, 12:28:04 PM] Miller: i think @17189742074 might win prize for most ridiculous looking

[5/19/17, 1:14:54 PM] James  L: Unsure as of yet. Waiting to here back from another hospital I went on an interview with.

[5/19/17, 2:19:14 PM] Launchpad: because I came very close to, just got lazy about it

[5/19/17, 2:22:45 PM] Launchpad: srsly
[5/19/17, 2:39:11 PM] Miller: cancelled after tim allen, a known and outspoken conservative, admitted he went to trumps inauguration?
[5/19/17, 2:39:14 PM] Miller: seems legit
[5/19/17, 2:39:30 PM] Launchpad: words on an image my friend
[5/19/17, 2:39:37 PM] Launchpad: The words have spoken!
[5/19/17, 2:39:58 PM] Justin: more like words all over every single conservative website
[5/19/17, 2:40:11 PM] Miller: EW had predicted in its annual Deathwatch rundown of bubble shows that Last Man Standing might squeak into another season, but that was mainly due to the series having been on the renewal bubble every year and yet always managing to survive despite a modest rating in the adult demo. The comedy averaged a hearty 8.1 million viewers for its sixth and final season, but a relatively weak 1.6 rating among adults 18-49. It‚Äôs also produced by an outside studio (20th Century Fox) and networks this year have been particularly aggressive about protecting shows produced in-house and shedding titles produced by rival companies.
[5/19/17, 2:40:15 PM] Miller: sorry these are not in words-on-picture format
[5/19/17, 2:40:27 PM] Miller: and i apologize for letting facts get in the way of a good narrative
[5/19/17, 2:40:59 PM] Justin: in fairness to conservative arument, if i was on abc board, id have cancelled that shitty show
[5/19/17, 2:41:10 PM] Justin: so i get the suspicion
[5/19/17, 2:41:16 PM] Launchpad: never saw it
[5/19/17, 2:41:28 PM] Justin: his wife is a frackign scientist
[5/19/17, 2:41:29 PM] Miller: nobody did

[5/19/17, 2:42:05 PM] Justin: he's got ablack conserrvative neighbor that he ahte sbecause hes black
[5/19/17, 2:42:09 PM] Miller: the real question is why are all these whiny snowflakes complaining?
[5/19/17, 2:42:14 PM] Launchpad: well Im going to renew Mr. Robot, that show is awesome
[5/19/17, 2:42:21 PM] Miller: entitled generation of whiners
[5/19/17, 2:42:30 PM] Justin: they kinda get along with each other, but hes constantly making lazy black comments or black criminal comments
[5/19/17, 2:42:47 PM] Miller: maybe if they didnt get participation trophies they would be able to handle dissapointments in the real world, like when a shitty tv show you like gets cancelled
[5/19/17, 2:43:24 PM] Justin: his son in law is liberal-"unemployed hippy" forcing his multiculturalism on everyone
[5/19/17, 2:43:44 PM] Justin: i get why conservative america loves the show

[5/19/17, 9:27:02 PM] James  L: Herman how many women are you going to abduct tonight and torture before feasting on their flesh
[5/19/17, 9:27:49 PM] Justin: Most serial killers are good looking and gregarious so I'll take that as a compliment
[5/19/17, 9:37:56 PM] James  L: As you open the mini van door and offer candy

[5/19/17, 10:18:58 PM] Steve: Stop snowflaking all over the group
[5/19/17, 10:19:11 PM] Miller: You would think that but....
[5/19/17, 10:19:57 PM] Justin: At  2 am in morning after skipping on options at penn it is pretty awesome.
[5/19/17, 10:20:07 PM] Justin: Just saying
[5/19/17, 10:20:47 PM] Miller: Guy spent 30 minutes telling me about this secret awesome place in Jamaica once
[5/19/17, 10:24:14 PM] Steve: Cool story brah
[5/19/17, 11:50:55 PM] Miller: Goddamn apparently shots fired at the future show at Barclay's Center
[5/19/17, 11:52:28 PM] Miller: Crazy they had some pretty serious metal detectors at RR show there, would be surprised if they didn't have the same
[5/19/17, 11:58:04 PM] Steve: Who cares
[5/19/17, 11:58:15 PM] Steve: Es sheeran 4 life

[5/20/17, 6:28:49 PM] Miller: Isiah Thomas done for the year? Should have made that sweep bet katz
[5/20/17, 6:30:02 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah, I should've, NBA playoffs are stupid. Cavs not actually going to play a real game until the finals
[5/20/17, 6:31:26 PM] Dan Watts: They played real games against the pacers

[5/20/17, 9:39:01 PM] Dan Watts: @16195657200 was trying to recreate the picture I took of him at the del mar which got him laid many times over. #FAIL
[5/20/17, 11:29:58 PM] Justin: I'm glad you are testing your long distance audio/video recording limits, but did you pay for those seats?
[5/20/17, 11:32:48 PM] Kiyoon: It's a festival on the beach

[5/21/17, 10:58:32 PM] Miller: Did Korver bet on the Celtics?
[5/21/17, 11:02:10 PM] Miller: Isiah Thomas LVP
[5/21/17, 11:03:09 PM] Miller: Celtics stupidly waited until the last second to shoot, didn't even give Cleveland a chance to bring it to overtime
[5/21/17, 11:03:26 PM] Dan Watts: Dude- so fucking dumb
[5/22/17, 12:26:28 AM] Kiyoon: Lol cause tied is the same as down 1!!!

[5/22/17, 12:27:12 AM] Kiyoon: #forgottheother20gamesthatdidntworkintheolayoffs
[5/22/17, 9:33:06 AM] Justin: If you want to actually get closer to the answer w that question you could actually look at shooting pct in tie games.
[5/22/17, 10:43:32 AM] Justin: porbably planted that picutre to distract from tax returns
[5/22/17, 10:43:59 AM] Donk: Looks like a private flight to me
[5/22/17, 10:44:24 AM] ‚ÄéBrian Katz changed this group's icon
[5/22/17, 10:44:28 AM] Justin: yeh maybe he vince younged it
[5/22/17, 10:44:36 AM] Donk: Either that or bernie is claiming to fly with small children to board early
[5/22/17, 10:44:40 AM] Scott: I hear that entire plane was first class
[5/22/17, 10:44:56 AM] Justin: they gotta start working on their leg room then
[5/22/17, 10:45:24 AM] Justin: shocked there even 5 people flying in montana at any given time
[5/22/17, 10:45:59 AM] Donk: Richard spencer has to fly back to avoid punches in the face
[5/22/17, 10:46:55 AM] Launchpad: couldn't even afford the $12 to select a window seat. Sad
[5/22/17, 11:44:50 AM] Justin: https://www.facebook.com/PeopleForBernie/videos/1995871400633064/
[5/22/17, 11:45:03 AM] Justin: of course they give bernie the easy layup.....more bernie propaganda machine
[5/22/17, 12:15:34 PM] Scott: Texts to prove it
[5/22/17, 12:16:12 PM] Donk: You break up with girls by text cheese?
[5/22/17, 12:16:14 PM] Donk: Harsh
[5/22/17, 12:16:20 PM] Justin: didnt even get to use hall pass, weak
[5/22/17, 12:18:22 PM] Launchpad: not going to need a hall pass for the terror Im about to unleash on Austin
[5/22/17, 12:19:55 PM] Scott: Lemme guess. Ur gonna go out to dinner with us sweat and shit ur pants and go home to sleep?
[5/22/17, 12:21:05 PM] Launchpad: yeah but when I do it its food poisoning, when you sweat and shit your pants its cause your freaking out a girl is actually talking to you
[5/22/17, 12:22:38 PM] Scott: That's not actually a thing.
[5/22/17, 12:23:31 PM] Launchpad: you're right, no girl would actually talk to you on purpose
[5/22/17, 12:24:17 PM] Scott: That's also untrue.
[5/22/17, 12:24:25 PM] Scott: Happens plenty of times.
[5/22/17, 12:24:36 PM] Miller: Only 90 percent of them work for him
[5/22/17, 12:24:37 PM] Brian Katz: You bringing those shorts cheese? Lol
[5/22/17, 12:24:44 PM] Scott: Shorts are bringing me
[5/22/17, 12:24:44 PM] Miller: The other 10 percent are bartenders
[5/22/17, 12:25:42 PM] Justin: i mean better than thinking a stripper wants the D
[5/22/17, 12:27:04 PM] Steve: I have witnessed cheeses game first hand in Friday
[5/22/17, 12:27:09 PM] Steve: #weaksauce
[5/22/17, 12:27:30 PM] Steve: Guy wouldn't approach women because "the looked like they were lesbians"
[5/22/17, 12:27:46 PM] Justin: good lesbians or bad lesbians?
[5/22/17, 12:28:00 PM] Steve: ^dont know what that means
[5/22/17, 12:28:14 PM] Steve: Like can you eat their assholes or not?
[5/22/17, 12:28:39 PM] Justin: cant get a video
[5/22/17, 12:28:46 PM] Justin: Rand: I scheme and plan for MONTHS and it gets screwed up because YOU can't control the students! NEVER send a woman to do a man's job!
President Garcia-Thompson: You cocky, pointy-nosed little Reaganite! If you hadn't provoked them, we wouldn't BE in this mess!
Rand: Whoa! Reality check here! Earth to TALL BITCH! What is your fault? THIS IS!
[turns on Droz]
Rand: Hey, poor boy! Go and have all your parties with all your new friends! I can see it now, Andrews. You and all the knee-jerk, bleeding-heart liberals, sipping tea and playing patty-cake. And those useless hippie pot-heads, those commie-pinko leftists. The bunny huggers, the pillow biters...
Droz: Whoa! Whoa! Which ones are the pillow biters again?
Rand: The BUTT-PIRATES! And those beastly man-haters, tell those chicks to shave their pits then call me! And those goddamn whiny crybaby minorities, you can keep them all!
[5/22/17, 12:29:02 PM] Steve: ^are you serious?
[5/22/17, 12:29:17 PM] Justin: when it comes to PCU always serious
[5/22/17, 12:29:30 PM] Steve: Thats just stupid
[5/22/17, 12:30:25 PM] Justin: may need to just redownload movie and start making my own clips of it
[5/22/17, 12:30:46 PM] Justin: 70 minute movie that has relevance to all conversations
[5/22/17, 12:30:51 PM] Miller: Seems like a good use of your time
[5/22/17, 12:33:04 PM] Steve: Or just copy and paste the transcripts as if we want to read them
[5/22/17, 12:33:09 PM] Steve: That also makes sense
[5/22/17, 4:16:45 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[5/22/17, 6:58:50 PM] Steve: Two bombs went off at Ariana grande concert
[5/22/17, 6:58:54 PM] Steve: 8 dead
[5/22/17, 7:11:55 PM] Miller: Who cares
[5/22/17, 7:11:58 PM] Miller: Es sheeran 4 life
[5/22/17, 7:12:09 PM] Steve: That's not cool
[5/22/17, 7:12:59 PM] Miller: So people getting shot at Barclay's Center is who cares but a bomb going off on the other side of the world is relevant?
[5/22/17, 7:14:30 PM] Steve: All you said was shots fired
[5/22/17, 7:14:30 PM] Steve: Not that anyone got shot
[5/22/17, 7:14:30 PM] Steve: Sorry if I take shots fired literally
[5/22/17, 7:15:32 PM] Steve: Also it ended up being a loud noise that led to a stampede
[5/22/17, 7:24:24 PM] Steve: Take a walk around the block and then come back and apologize
[5/22/17, 7:27:27 PM] Miller: Apologize for....?
[5/22/17, 7:28:57 PM] Miller: While you're figuring that out I got some trump humor
[5/22/17, 7:29:31 PM] Miller: Just recently discovered what was on that note
[5/22/17, 7:29:55 PM] Steve: Reporting fake news
[5/22/17, 7:30:35 PM] Miller: I'm not a reporter I'm just a middleman blame twitter
[5/22/17, 7:31:18 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/22/17, 7:32:49 PM] Miller: Now that's fake news
[5/22/17, 7:32:59 PM] Miller: But might as well be real
[5/22/17, 7:34:15 PM] Miller: @16195657200 gonna cancel his tesla now  House now taking up bill to create $100 registration fee for electric cars, $30 for hybrids ... This would raise $500K for next year
[5/22/17, 7:35:07 PM] Launchpad: I'll just cover it with bitcoin
[5/22/17, 7:36:59 PM] Steve: Is that how you are paying for Austin?
[5/22/17, 7:37:11 PM] Launchpad: Yup
[5/22/17, 7:37:29 PM] Miller: Bottles on launchpad
[5/22/17, 7:37:54 PM] Launchpad: Bottles of smart water
[5/22/17, 7:38:01 PM] Miller: This is literally a repeat of last year but now instead of weed stocks its bitcoin
[5/22/17, 7:38:12 PM] Steve: Yea
[5/22/17, 7:38:19 PM] Launchpad: All time high bro
[5/22/17, 7:38:24 PM] Miller: Launchpad brags about how rich he is until people tell him to buy drinks then he goes radio silent
[5/22/17, 7:38:27 PM] Steve: He's def leaving us with his part of an "expensive" bill
[5/22/17, 7:38:44 PM] Launchpad: Now if only i bought etherium lime i intended to,  i would be quitting my job
[5/22/17, 7:39:18 PM] Launchpad: You bludgeon the fact I'm frugal
[5/22/17, 7:40:21 PM] Launchpad: If youre rich enough to suggest bottle service, youre rich enough to buy the bottles
[5/22/17, 7:40:48 PM] Miller: That statement makes no sense
[5/22/17, 7:40:51 PM] Miller: Saying 2 words costs nothing
[5/22/17, 7:40:59 PM] Launchpad: Fortunately Austin isn't really a 'bottle service' city
[5/22/17, 7:41:01 PM] Miller: Literally anyone could do it
[5/22/17, 7:41:27 PM] Miller: Fine you can just buy some fireball rounds
[5/22/17, 7:42:03 PM] Miller: And for your service we'll all listen to you talk about bitcoin for 2 minutes without complaining
[5/22/17, 7:42:14 PM] Launchpad: Lol
[5/22/17, 7:42:42 PM] Scott: I will purposefully abstain from a fireball shot and complain for the entire 2 minutes. Your welcome guys.
[5/22/17, 7:43:20 PM] Miller: Be nice to your roommate
[5/22/17, 7:44:40 PM] Steve: Also, I don't agree to that date
[5/22/17, 7:44:44 PM] Miller: You guys should get like a honeymoon suite and then fight over who gets to use it every night
[5/22/17, 7:44:46 PM] Miller: Actually cheese do you have a hall pass? May not even matter
[5/22/17, 7:44:48 PM] Steve: He's literally got to buy me my own bottle
[5/22/17, 7:45:00 PM] Steve: Ooouuuuuuu
[5/22/17, 7:45:02 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/22/17, 7:45:11 PM] Steve: She only likes it in his office mills
[5/22/17, 7:45:15 PM] Steve: On the floor
[5/22/17, 7:53:58 PM] Brian Katz: What does that even mean? Lol
[5/22/17, 7:54:18 PM] Steve: Classy in the streets
[5/22/17, 7:54:24 PM] Steve: Throw you around in the sheets
[5/22/17, 7:54:34 PM] Miller: Delta kind of blows also tho
[5/22/17, 7:54:47 PM] Steve: Also true
[5/22/17, 7:54:51 PM] Miller: Maybe not drag you off and beat you up bad
[5/22/17, 7:56:04 PM] Launchpad: This is Austin. We go Southwest in the streets
[5/22/17, 7:56:31 PM] Launchpad: And were also going to Franklins BBQ fyi
[5/22/17, 7:56:44 PM] Miller: I am not but I cannot stop anyone else from
[5/22/17, 7:57:06 PM] Launchpad: Franklin's? Why not?
[5/22/17, 7:57:23 PM] Miller: I have no desire to spend hours waiting on a line
[5/22/17, 7:57:29 PM] Miller: I'm going to the salt lick
[5/22/17, 7:57:35 PM] Launchpad: Done
[5/22/17, 7:57:47 PM] Miller: Which is fucking awesome and if I'm gonna wait they have a beer garden to wait in
[5/22/17, 7:57:52 PM] Launchpad: But how far away is it?
[5/22/17, 7:58:01 PM] Miller: 40 minutes or something
[5/22/17, 7:58:31 PM] Launchpad: Were going to have to figure out how to get there...
[5/22/17, 7:58:40 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/BcyFJLrBVhA
[5/22/17, 7:58:50 PM] Steve: Naaa lyft
[5/22/17, 7:59:00 PM] Steve: Cheese and I are boycotting uber
[5/22/17, 7:59:06 PM] Miller: No good lyft related song
[5/22/17, 7:59:24 PM] Miller: Don't really care which car service we take, I also fucking hate Uber so I'm down
[5/22/17, 7:59:49 PM] Launchpad: Weird youd sit in an Uber for an hour and a half but not Franklin's line
[5/22/17, 8:00:10 PM] Launchpad: I actually haven't been to Franklins,  only salt lick
[5/22/17, 8:00:14 PM] Miller: One is standing on a hot line
[5/22/17, 8:00:26 PM] Miller: One is listening to jams in an air conditioned car
[5/22/17, 8:00:32 PM] Miller: I dont think it's that weird
[5/22/17, 8:00:47 PM] Steve: No despacito, yet
[5/22/17, 8:01:01 PM] Steve: Maybe someday you'll put the biggest Latino songs since Macarena on the tunes
[5/22/17, 8:01:08 PM] Miller: And supposedly Franklin's can be up to 3 hours and need to get there early
[5/22/17, 8:01:08 PM] Steve: #racism
[5/22/17, 8:01:33 PM] Miller: I never went but I went through this decision making process last time
[5/22/17, 8:05:20 PM] Launchpad: Last time i had a party bus so it was easy
[5/22/17, 8:05:35 PM] Miller: I'm down for that also
[5/22/17, 8:05:53 PM] Miller: Whatever costs you the most money
[5/22/17, 8:06:22 PM] Steve: I'm down for a party bus
[5/22/17, 8:06:22 PM] Launchpad: Im just going to eat breakfast tacos
[5/22/17, 8:06:25 PM] Steve: On LP
[5/22/17, 8:06:43 PM] Steve: Better hope hey have a toilet for your shits
[5/22/17, 8:07:22 PM] Launchpad: Only 235 pound LP had monster shits
[5/22/17, 8:08:36 PM] Dan Watts: Party bus! üöå
[5/22/17, 8:09:00 PM] Launchpad: Hopefully theres a toilet for Hermans mcdonalds shits
[5/22/17, 8:13:17 PM] Donk: My cousin just went to austin for a bachelor party - he said you can order franklins in advance and skip the line and pick it up
[5/22/17, 8:13:27 PM] Donk: You just have to make a bulk order
[5/22/17, 8:13:45 PM] Donk: Like 5lbs of meat or something. Which isnt that much for 10 people
[5/22/17, 8:14:04 PM] Miller: K I'm down to do that as well as long as launchpad picks it up
[5/22/17, 8:14:11 PM] Miller: (and pays for it)
[5/22/17, 8:14:28 PM] Launchpad: We have 3 days... no reason we can't do both
[5/22/17, 8:14:35 PM] Miller: Agreed
[5/22/17, 8:14:48 PM] Miller: I'll be happy eating BBQ at literally every meal
[5/22/17, 8:17:00 PM] Dan Watts: We've got to try this organic vegan restaurant
[5/22/17, 8:17:25 PM] Miller: Do they have shots?
[5/22/17, 8:17:40 PM] Dan Watts: Of wheatgrass
[5/22/17, 8:18:27 PM] Launchpad: Great now I can stay sober and puke
[5/22/17, 8:18:54 PM] Launchpad: Salt lick also has that all you can eat family style
[5/22/17, 8:19:10 PM] Miller: Yea that's the only way to go
[5/22/17, 8:19:54 PM] Launchpad: Tex/mex + breakfast tacos deserve a mention at some point
[5/22/17, 8:40:26 PM] Scott: No they don't  leave that shit in San Diego
[5/22/17, 8:44:14 PM] Launchpad: TEX mex is a San Diego thing? ü§î
[5/22/17, 8:45:42 PM] Scott: Tacos
[5/22/17, 8:46:58 PM] Dan Watts: Me @15166335046 and @16316620763 were at a spot in forest hills that had "Mexico Wednesday" and it looked way more üî•üî•üî• than taco tues
[5/22/17, 8:47:30 PM] Launchpad: Pics or it didn't count
[5/22/17, 8:48:06 PM] Dan Watts: We were there on a Friday
[5/22/17, 8:48:06 PM] Launchpad: Breakfast tacos are a texas thing,  stop putting your ignorance on full display
[5/22/17, 8:49:26 PM] Launchpad: why did it look so üî•
[5/22/17, 8:49:45 PM] Launchpad: You weren't even there for it
[5/22/17, 8:50:06 PM] Miller: Hump day tacos? It's a lituation
[5/22/17, 8:50:46 PM] Dan Watts: Great prices too
[5/22/17, 8:51:47 PM] Miller: Great prices? @16195657200 be like
[5/22/17, 9:03:44 PM] Launchpad: Not even close
[5/22/17, 9:05:27 PM] Launchpad: You can take your Mexico Wednesday and get the fuck out

[5/23/17, 1:17:49 PM] Brian Katz: Miller, can I choose who starts in my taxi squad? Or does it have to be these rookies?
[5/23/17, 2:11:55 PM] Launchpad: You can immediately promote rookies to roster to leave room for guys currently there
[5/23/17, 2:12:51 PM] Brian Katz: Thanks Scotty
[5/23/17, 2:14:39 PM] Donk: Just has to have less than 3 years experiencd to stay there
[5/23/17, 2:17:11 PM] Steve: And never have been on anyone's active roster
[5/23/17, 2:29:28 PM] Brian Katz: Thanks guys
[5/23/17, 2:53:50 PM] Scott: taxi police back at it.
[5/23/17, 3:01:40 PM] Justin: leave one of them katz...i dare you

[5/23/17, 3:15:08 PM] Steve: Hermans team is a championship team @16318489683
[5/23/17, 3:15:16 PM] Steve: What don't you understand?!?!?!?!
[5/23/17, 3:15:55 PM] Justin: hope you got something to help you not cry yourself to sleep after you lose that belt
[5/23/17, 3:17:00 PM] Justin: that clip needs to be admired, he threw 3 punches before gravity could even take effect
[5/23/17, 3:17:33 PM] Justin: rip
[5/23/17, 3:18:03 PM] Steve: Herm, I'm not crying about anything.
[5/23/17, 3:18:28 PM] Steve: But you keep saying that and I guess the more you repeat it to yourself the more you believe it
[5/23/17, 3:20:13 PM] Justin: yeh not serious when i say ill be champ, think i said it once and at the same time i said im gonna finish in 6th more likely
[5/23/17, 3:20:30 PM] Steve: I'm not even talking about that
[5/23/17, 3:20:31 PM] Justin: will continue to snipe katz taxi squad though
[5/23/17, 3:20:36 PM] Steve: You most certainly won't be champ
[5/23/17, 3:20:50 PM] Steve: But you have said that I will cry when I lose the belt
[5/23/17, 3:20:55 PM] Justin: you will
[5/23/17, 3:21:08 PM] Steve: Have you ever seen me cry?
[5/23/17, 3:21:11 PM] Steve: About anything?
[5/23/17, 3:21:28 PM] Justin: i mean i seen your relationship witht that belt
[5/23/17, 3:21:28 PM] Steve: In the 9+ years you've known me
[5/23/17, 3:21:31 PM] Justin: youll cry
[5/23/17, 3:21:38 PM] Scott: i think herman's still starting calvin johnson at WR
[5/23/17, 3:21:48 PM] Steve: I am proud I won it
[5/23/17, 3:22:06 PM] Steve: And most of the reason I do the photo shoots I do with it is to make you all more motivated
[5/23/17, 3:22:15 PM] Justin: says the guy starting matt assiata
[5/23/17, 3:22:17 PM] Steve: Some of it is just to gloat
[5/23/17, 3:22:37 PM] Scott: He isn't on my team
[5/23/17, 3:22:43 PM] Steve: But I certainly won't cry over losing because, unfortunately at some point, it's bound to happen.
[5/23/17, 3:22:46 PM] Justin: kinda like 99% percent of why im saying you will cry is to shittalk
[5/23/17, 3:22:54 PM] Justin: not getting the disconnect
[5/23/17, 3:23:02 PM] Steve: It's really bad shit talk
[5/23/17, 3:23:18 PM] Steve: You are more creative than that
[5/23/17, 3:23:26 PM] Justin: saying you will cry yourself to sleep at night, i like it
[5/23/17, 3:23:47 PM] Steve: Sure, maybe the first time
[5/23/17, 3:24:00 PM] Steve: But saying briber and I've again it kind of loses its luster
[5/23/17, 3:24:16 PM] Steve: *over and over
[5/23/17, 3:24:21 PM] Justin: Asiata, Matt 
Coleman, Tevin 
Harris, DuJuan

[5/23/17, 3:27:31 PM] Miller: Should bring back Sean tbh
[5/23/17, 3:27:32 PM] Donk: Yeah, but kinda ridiculous to make fun of anothers teams roster when you dont know your own
[5/23/17, 3:30:02 PM] Steve: Irving likely to get suspended
[5/23/17, 3:30:12 PM] Steve: Pretty sure we have no defensive lineman left
[5/23/17, 3:35:17 PM] Dan Watts: Asiata- No team, Coleman- nice- Dujuan Harris- out of the league, Eddie Lacy- Fat, Doug Martin- suspended/sucks, J Stew- Old, not as nice as christian mcaffrey
[5/23/17, 3:35:45 PM] Scott: Dan watts - forever shitty fantasy team
[5/23/17, 3:36:08 PM] Justin: cheese just trump responsed you...no data or reference point- all gut feeling

[5/23/17, 4:18:05 PM] Steve: Luckily I don't care what you think or believe
[5/23/17, 8:08:57 PM] Miller: @AdamSchefter: Nike now pays Odell Beckham Jr. more than the Giants. https://t.co/T31VpLGC2j
[5/23/17, 8:09:29 PM] Donk: Happens alot
[5/23/17, 8:09:47 PM] Donk: Probably most superstars
[5/23/17, 8:10:35 PM] Steve: Especially in the NFL
[5/23/17, 8:13:13 PM] Miller: I was surprised nfl guys get paid that much for endorsement, nba sure but I've never seen anyone rocking the odell Beckham cleats
[5/23/17, 8:13:30 PM] Steve: It's more fore gear
[5/23/17, 8:13:39 PM] Steve: Like odb sweatshirts
[5/23/17, 8:13:43 PM] Steve: Headbands
[5/23/17, 8:13:45 PM] Steve: Tshirt
[5/23/17, 8:13:48 PM] Steve: Shorts
[5/23/17, 8:14:00 PM] Steve: They'll create a logo for him
[5/23/17, 8:14:10 PM] Miller: You ever seen anyone ever wearing something that you knew was odell related?
[5/23/17, 8:14:10 PM] Steve: If he doesn't already have one
[5/23/17, 8:14:22 PM] Donk: I think he signed for 5mil a year with nike. Giants will  pay him more than that on his 2nd deal
[5/23/17, 8:14:23 PM] Steve: No but he also could have not had anything
[5/23/17, 8:14:36 PM] Steve: I don't even know if he was signed with anyone before that
[5/23/17, 8:14:49 PM] Steve: If the giants resign him
[5/23/17, 8:14:56 PM] Donk: He was signed with nilw before that
[5/23/17, 8:15:02 PM] Miller: Yea idk I just can't think of any nfl player that would apply to
[5/23/17, 8:15:02 PM] Donk: Nike as well i mean
[5/23/17, 8:15:17 PM] Donk: Peyton probably got way more in endorsements
[5/23/17, 8:15:24 PM] Miller: Papa John's
[5/23/17, 8:15:29 PM] Miller: I'm talking sports gear
[5/23/17, 8:15:31 PM] Steve: Tom Brady has a brand
[5/23/17, 8:15:34 PM] Steve: People rock that
[5/23/17, 8:15:38 PM] Miller: Cmon
[5/23/17, 8:15:41 PM] Launchpad: its more just to endorse Nike over any individual Odel line
[5/23/17, 8:15:42 PM] Miller: Do they?
[5/23/17, 8:15:52 PM] Steve: I've seen a uhh of people rock the Tb hats
[5/23/17, 8:15:55 PM] Steve: *bunch
[5/23/17, 8:15:56 PM] Miller: You ever seen anyone rocking a Tom Brady whatever it is he has
[5/23/17, 8:16:01 PM] Steve: Mainly in the New England area
[5/23/17, 8:16:13 PM] Steve: I have
[5/23/17, 8:16:15 PM] Miller: Fair enough
[5/23/17, 8:16:21 PM] Steve: Connecticut
[5/23/17, 8:16:23 PM] Steve: Mass
[5/23/17, 8:16:27 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[5/23/17, 8:16:30 PM] Miller: I've never seen anyone rocking anything nfl related that's not like a jersey
[5/23/17, 8:16:43 PM] Steve: Also beast mode stuff
[5/23/17, 8:16:53 PM] Steve: Have see hats and tshirts
[5/23/17, 8:16:57 PM] Steve: *seen
[5/23/17, 8:17:06 PM] Miller: I mean I've seen him wearing it
[5/23/17, 8:17:09 PM] Miller: That's about it
[5/23/17, 8:17:47 PM] Miller: How many of those shirts they really sell? Doesn't matter for him because I think he owns that like big baller brand
[5/23/17, 8:17:50 PM] Steve: Seattle fans
[5/23/17, 8:17:59 PM] Steve: No idea
[5/23/17, 8:18:06 PM] Steve: Don't have his sales stats handy lol
[5/23/17, 8:18:13 PM] Steve: But they are pricey for white tshirts
[5/23/17, 8:18:21 PM] Miller: I feel like all the money from nba comes from sneaker sales
[5/23/17, 8:18:25 PM] Steve: Or just any tshirt
[5/23/17, 8:18:28 PM] Miller: Which you obviously don't get in nfl
[5/23/17, 8:18:34 PM] Steve: Nope
[5/23/17, 8:18:47 PM] Steve: But people def rock NFL players brands if they are big enough
[5/23/17, 8:18:54 PM] Steve: Popular enough
[5/23/17, 8:18:59 PM] Miller: If they do I've never noticed
[5/23/17, 8:21:05 PM] Steve: No I know you've seen that episode
[5/23/17, 8:21:09 PM] Steve: *and
[5/23/17, 8:21:43 PM] Miller: I feel like Mark Wahlberg should not count in any Tom Brady discussion
[5/23/17, 8:21:56 PM] Steve: Too many rules
[5/23/17, 8:21:59 PM] Miller: Always
[5/23/17, 8:22:19 PM] Miller: It's like you saying Joe Budden doesn't sell any albums (true) and me countering with the 12 I own
[5/23/17, 8:22:42 PM] Steve: Bigger question, you still buy albums?
[5/23/17, 8:22:45 PM] Steve: Stop
[5/23/17, 8:22:49 PM] Miller: I do
[5/23/17, 8:22:58 PM] Miller: Only for a handful of people
[5/23/17, 8:23:12 PM] Steve: I'm not talking about vinyls you frame and hang on the wall
[5/23/17, 8:23:21 PM] Miller: I realize that
[5/23/17, 8:23:25 PM] Steve: I don't think I own a single cd anymore
[5/23/17, 8:23:32 PM] Steve: Maybe I still have Green Day rookie
[5/23/17, 8:23:36 PM] Steve: *dookie
[5/23/17, 8:23:41 PM] Steve: Doubt it though
[5/23/17, 8:24:06 PM] Steve: How do you even play them anymore? Your DVD player?
[5/23/17, 8:24:14 PM] Miller: I like to buy them to support artists I like who aren't that rich and if I'm going to buy it I'd prefer to get a physical copy vs digital if it's the same price
[5/23/17, 8:24:27 PM] Steve: Fair enough
[5/23/17, 8:24:32 PM] Steve: Respek that
[5/23/17, 8:24:41 PM] Miller: I dont play them
[5/23/17, 8:24:46 PM] Steve: I just blame Miller tunes for spoiling them
[5/23/17, 8:24:52 PM] Steve: *me
[5/23/17, 8:24:52 PM] Miller: I just buy them and then play the pirated copies
[5/23/17, 8:24:58 PM] Miller: Souvenirs
[5/23/17, 8:25:04 PM] Steve: Fair enough
[5/23/17, 8:25:14 PM] Steve: Kids hear days want even know what a Walkman is
[5/23/17, 8:25:22 PM] Steve: *these
[5/23/17, 8:25:36 PM] Miller: Honestly my kids won't even know what an ipod is
[5/23/17, 8:25:48 PM] Steve: That may also be true
[5/23/17, 8:26:05 PM] Steve: Does your wife not have one for running?
[5/23/17, 8:26:18 PM] Miller: She uses a smart watch or her phone
[5/23/17, 8:26:31 PM] Miller: I still use an ipod on occasion because I'm an old man
[5/23/17, 8:26:31 PM] Steve: Ooooouuuuuuu
[5/23/17, 8:26:39 PM] Steve: You are an old man
[5/23/17, 8:26:45 PM] Steve: Won't ever hear me argue that ;)
[5/23/17, 8:30:21 PM] Miller: Wtf is this new icon? What is going on there?
[5/23/17, 8:31:12 PM] ‚ÄéSteve changed this group's icon
[5/23/17, 8:34:42 PM] Miller: I found someone with less game than cheese
[5/23/17, 8:34:58 PM] Steve: Non existent
[5/23/17, 8:35:10 PM] Steve: #fakenews
[5/23/17, 8:36:05 PM] Steve: What's happening?
[5/23/17, 8:36:09 PM] Miller: Exactly
[5/23/17, 8:37:02 PM] Launchpad: sounds like hes got more game though
[5/23/17, 8:37:03 PM] Launchpad: he was getting her wet
[5/23/17, 8:37:24 PM] Miller: Take notes cheese
[5/23/17, 10:26:18 PM] Miller: Kyrie going nuts
[5/23/17, 10:26:32 PM] Steve: We watching son!
[5/23/17, 10:33:56 PM] Kiyoon: That's with a sprained ankle
[5/23/17, 10:34:10 PM] Scott: You're a sprained ankle.
[5/23/17, 10:34:20 PM] Steve: Cheese is high
[5/23/17, 10:34:27 PM] Miller: Oh god
[5/23/17, 10:34:31 PM] Scott: üëçüèº
[5/23/17, 10:34:32 PM] Steve: Exactly
[5/23/17, 10:34:43 PM] Scott: ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
[5/23/17, 10:35:08 PM] Miller: Who would have thought cheese would be wrecking homes and smoking weed on a school night
[5/23/17, 10:35:13 PM] Miller: What's next?
[5/23/17, 10:35:39 PM] Scott: Check yoself before cheese wreckyoseld
[5/23/17, 10:35:41 PM] Scott: Self
[5/23/17, 10:45:43 PM] Kiyoon: You've already wrecked yourself
[5/23/17, 10:46:03 PM] Steve: Technically, it was my bud
[5/23/17, 10:46:10 PM] Kiyoon: Shocking
[5/23/17, 10:46:24 PM] Kiyoon: Cheese supply the Dutch while you supply the twenty bag???
[5/23/17, 10:46:35 PM] Steve: Lol sounds very condescending
[5/23/17, 10:46:42 PM] Steve: Don't be mad because you can't smoke anymore
[5/23/17, 10:47:21 PM] Brian Katz: He can't smoke anymore?
[5/23/17, 10:47:35 PM] Steve: He got the weedcuffs on
[5/23/17, 10:58:17 PM] Scott: More like the bitchcuffs
[5/23/17, 11:02:21 PM] Kiyoon: Or security clearance cuffs
[5/23/17, 11:02:38 PM] Kiyoon: If I ever want Top Secret probably not a good idea
[5/23/17, 11:03:22 PM] Steve: Lol, son, do you know who the president is? Pretty sure cheese can take a White House tour and trump will tell him top secret shit.
[5/23/17, 11:03:50 PM] Steve: But other than that, I respek it but don't judge boo
[5/23/17, 11:04:01 PM] Kiyoon: I was judging Cheese
[5/23/17, 11:04:05 PM] Kiyoon: Not for his smoking weed
[5/23/17, 11:04:15 PM] Kiyoon: But his cheapness
[5/23/17, 11:04:27 PM] Steve: I judge him for it all
[5/23/17, 11:04:32 PM] Steve: It doesn't matter
[5/23/17, 11:09:31 PM] Scott: I'm not cheap
[5/23/17, 11:09:56 PM] Scott: üñïüèø
[5/23/17, 11:10:03 PM] Steve: Debatable
[5/24/17, 8:19:12 AM] Scott: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/economy/uber-drivers-tax.html
[5/24/17, 8:19:16 AM] Scott: #cheesewasright
[5/24/17, 8:19:21 AM] Scott: keep hating haters.
[5/24/17, 8:59:55 AM] Justin: Lol. Whatever happened with that?
[5/24/17, 9:03:36 AM] Justin: That sux Cheese
[5/24/17, 9:10:06 AM] Scott: Lol I'm gonna get back in the building hopefully.
[5/24/17, 9:23:47 AM] Miller: https://theringer.com/linkin-park-one-more-light-album-review-ce00c5805ba5 doesnt sound great
[5/24/17, 9:23:51 AM] Scott: For everything
[5/24/17, 9:24:11 AM] Scott: Listened to a few songs. Relatively whack compared to their old stuff
[5/24/17, 9:42:30 AM] Justin: I mean is it heavy?
[5/24/17, 9:46:30 AM] Donk: Ive only heard the single
[5/24/17, 9:46:45 AM] Donk: And was shocked to find out it was linken park
[5/24/17, 9:46:56 AM] Donk: I also turned it off after 1min
[5/24/17, 9:52:34 AM] Justin: Too heavy couldnt hold on
[5/24/17, 10:07:02 AM] Launchpad: Etherium market cap, 20.4 billion - now worth more than Snapchat
[5/24/17, 11:13:04 AM] Justin: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias
[5/24/17, 11:15:34 AM] Launchpad: lol please get out of here
[5/24/17, 11:16:24 AM] Justin: What, not really controversial
[5/24/17, 11:18:01 AM] Justin: Had you invested in every stock you "could have invested in" along side the investment you would have made in this stock, likely it would have made little overall impact on your overall gains.
[5/24/17, 11:18:35 AM] Justin: But as humans we remember the times we missed and would have ht
[5/24/17, 11:18:36 AM] Launchpad: oh shut the fuck up Im pointing out the fact its worth more than snapchat thats the only thing I said
[5/24/17, 11:19:08 AM] Justin: I'm gonna say stfu back you know that isn't true
[5/24/17, 11:19:22 AM] Justin: I mean I can go back and quote you
[5/24/17, 11:19:23 AM] Launchpad: what isn't true?
[5/24/17, 11:20:10 AM] Justin: The reason you are pointing t out is you have pointed out in the past how you want ted to invest in it
[5/24/17, 11:20:32 AM] Justin: Which is literally the cognitive bias I showed you
[5/24/17, 11:20:36 AM] Launchpad: so am I not allowed to talk about it anymore? is it a forbidden topic?
[5/24/17, 11:20:43 AM] Justin: No
[5/24/17, 11:20:48 AM] Justin: You can talk about it
[5/24/17, 11:21:16 AM] Justin: All you want. Hence why I can post that bias and you can't tell me to stfu, that's nonsense
[5/24/17, 11:27:19 AM] Justin: In end doesn't change my inference as to why you are talking about it. I'm sure plenty of companies are now worth more than Facebook, yet you chose the one you regret not investing in. I mean pretty obvious connection between why you chose to point out the market cap of that company.
[5/24/17, 11:27:35 AM] Justin: More than Snapchat * lol.
[5/24/17, 11:28:33 AM] Launchpad: I think you're just being an asshole
[5/24/17, 11:29:03 AM] Justin: Really not. Pointing out that's a common bias.
[5/24/17, 11:29:17 AM] Justin: You seem to not want to believe that though, which is interesting
[5/24/17, 11:30:45 AM] Launchpad: All I said is that Etherium is worth more than Snapchat - I never claimed to have predicted all along that it would be
[5/24/17, 11:31:02 AM] Launchpad: so yes, I have regret for not investing
[5/24/17, 11:33:05 AM] Justin: So you rather be associated with result oriented bias?
[5/24/17, 11:33:37 AM] Justin: I mean take your pick. Also not attacking you. Just pointing out it's common
[5/24/17, 11:33:53 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD5sVX0SZDk
[5/24/17, 11:33:53 AM] Launchpad: what are you fucken talking about???
[5/24/17, 11:34:09 AM] Justin: Never mind
[5/24/17, 11:34:21 AM] Justin: I'm wrong, I'll drop it
[5/24/17, 11:34:59 AM] Launchpad: good cause I don't even know what you're talking about anymore
[5/24/17, 11:35:49 AM] Justin: Apprently nothing
[5/24/17, 11:46:01 AM] Justin: pope dosnt look happy
[5/24/17, 11:46:34 AM] Brian Katz: Probably missed his morning kid touching to meet Trump
[5/24/17, 11:46:51 AM] Justin: also think media is talking about melania and ivanka wearing mandated head garments?
[5/24/17, 11:48:04 AM] Justin: this pope to busy talkign about comdoms and poverty to fondle kids
[5/24/17, 11:48:27 AM] Justin: too close to jesus for americans
[5/24/17, 11:49:51 AM] Steve: So it's a tradition for women to wear black and a head garment when they meet the pope
[5/24/17, 11:50:06 AM] Steve: It's outdated and stupid
[5/24/17, 11:50:06 AM] Steve: But they kept with that tradition, obviously
[5/24/17, 11:51:00 AM] Donk: And yet neither covered their heads when visiting saudi arabia ü§îü§î
[5/24/17, 11:51:09 AM] Steve: Also a fact
[5/24/17, 11:51:10 AM] Justin: donk gets the point
[5/24/17, 11:51:10 AM] Donk: Selective signs of respect
[5/24/17, 11:51:27 AM] Steve: Yea everyone knows hat point Herman
[5/24/17, 11:51:27 AM] Miller: but did they touch the popes glowing orb
[5/24/17, 11:51:33 AM] Steve: It's like pointing out the sky is blue
[5/24/17, 11:51:37 AM] Steve: But congrats
[5/24/17, 11:54:08 AM] Dan Watts: Did trump and co go to a mosque during Saudi Arabia trip
[5/24/17, 11:54:34 AM] Dan Watts: If so then possibly disrespectful not to cover head
[5/24/17, 11:54:53 AM] Dan Watts: If just walking around in public then not disrepectfuk
[5/24/17, 11:55:02 AM] Dan Watts: Disrespectful*
[5/24/17, 11:55:19 AM] Justin: lieterally illegal in saudia arabia, just saying
[5/24/17, 11:55:33 AM] Justin: and disrepect is meaningless the point is if one rleigion is backwards
[5/24/17, 11:55:36 AM] Justin: wtf is the other?
[5/24/17, 11:55:57 AM] Dan Watts: So every time a western woman goes to Saudi Arabia she has to cover head?
[5/24/17, 11:56:00 AM] Justin: they mandate the same thing, how we view that mandate is ohhh ones is tradition the other is backwards
[5/24/17, 11:56:03 AM] Steve: Both are backwards
[5/24/17, 11:56:52 AM] Dan Watts: Either way it's a big difference when you're going into a house of worship rather than walking the streets
[5/24/17, 11:56:55 AM] Steve: Anytime any woman is in Saudi Arabia she must cover at least her hear
[5/24/17, 11:56:59 AM] Steve: *head
[5/24/17, 11:57:18 AM] Steve: Some more conservative women wear that entire cover where you only see their eyes
[5/24/17, 12:01:51 PM] Dan Watts: Yeah so from what I read it's not illegal for western women to not wear headscarf
[5/24/17, 12:02:04 PM] Dan Watts: And since she didn't go to mosque I see no problem with it
[5/24/17, 12:03:01 PM] Justin: pretty sure its still illegal, she was given excemption
[5/24/17, 12:03:43 PM] Justin: i dont care about respect or not respect though really.  you defining the church as holy but areeas outside a church as not as holy is completely subjective
[5/24/17, 12:04:19 PM] Dan Watts: What I do have a problem with however, is forcing women do dress like ninjas, Forbid education and in some countries perform clitorectomies on them. I don't understand why so called feminists aren't protesting strict Muslim regimes vociferously
[5/24/17, 12:04:50 PM] Justin: well i mean once again now were getting into culture versus relifgion
[5/24/17, 12:05:29 PM] Justin: specifcally the genital mutilation is an afircan thing, hgiher in some catholic countires
[5/24/17, 12:05:49 PM] Justin: what exactly do you think the vatican wear loooks like?
[5/24/17, 12:06:03 PM] Justin: they look like they are takign adams family values portrait
[5/24/17, 12:06:40 PM] Launchpad: anyone watch the newest season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmitt?? They do a nice job of mocking SJW culture
[5/24/17, 12:07:18 PM] Justin: who is defneding these regimes?
[5/24/17, 12:08:14 PM] Justin: depeer question, why the fuck is Saudia Arabia, a wahabbist regime, our US ally when they support terrosim and isis
[5/24/17, 12:09:12 PM] Dan Watts: Linda sarsour was a featured speaker @ the women's march. Read some of her tweets and tell me she represents western liberal ideals
[5/24/17, 12:09:34 PM] Justin: think she was actualyl founder
[5/24/17, 12:10:01 PM] Miller: yea she was one of the founders
[5/24/17, 12:10:55 PM] Justin: never read her twitter watts, anxiously await some examples though
[5/24/17, 12:11:42 PM] Steve: Also, why are we not more angry that the biggest corporation in the world continues to cover up child sexual assaults?
[5/24/17, 12:12:20 PM] Launchpad: Apple is covering up child sex assaults?
[5/24/17, 12:12:22 PM] Justin: facebook?
[5/24/17, 12:12:27 PM] Justin: lol
[5/24/17, 12:12:30 PM] Steve: Catholic Church
[5/24/17, 12:12:41 PM] Justin: idk but that was a great movie
[5/24/17, 12:12:45 PM] Steve: They are the wealthiest land owners in this city
[5/24/17, 12:12:49 PM] Miller: guys he said biggest........ehterium is covering up sexual assault
[5/24/17, 12:12:56 PM] Justin: i like this pope, i therefore give church a pass
[5/24/17, 12:13:11 PM] Steve: Lol^great logic
[5/24/17, 12:13:54 PM] Justin: its probably similar to trump or any other issue, desensitization
[5/24/17, 12:14:31 PM] Steve: Nope
[5/24/17, 12:14:50 PM] Justin: well than lack of media coverage on real issues like child abuse?
[5/24/17, 12:15:14 PM] Steve: No one should be desensitized to poor children getting taken advantage of by grown men who use religion as a pass on crime
[5/24/17, 12:15:22 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[5/24/17, 12:15:30 PM] Steve: I'd agree with that also
[5/24/17, 12:16:17 PM] Miller: Only so many hours in the day
[5/24/17, 12:16:18 PM] Justin: similar to Obama lowering  Malaysia's child sex traffic "rating" to let them into his trade agreement, lack of vcoverage
[5/24/17, 12:16:30 PM] Justin: and yeh 2 ice cream scoops
[5/24/17, 12:16:41 PM] Miller: Or Hillary Clinton running a child sex slave ring under a pizzeria
[5/24/17, 12:16:46 PM] Justin: lol
[5/24/17, 12:16:51 PM] Miller: Didn't see any coverage of that from the liberal media
[5/24/17, 12:17:24 PM] Justin: 2/3 things above mentioned are real, but i wont force facts on anyone that wants to stop the connection of child trafficing out of pizza shops
[5/24/17, 12:18:09 PM] Justin: fox had to retract that whole dnc staffer story/wikilieaks assasination ...althoguh some progressive's are still running with it
[5/24/17, 12:18:19 PM] Dan Watts: Have a Depo @2  prepping witness now but I'll get you some sarsour tweets
[5/24/17, 12:18:36 PM] Dan Watts: You can just google "Linda sarsour tweets"
[5/24/17, 12:19:27 PM] Launchpad: Linda Sarsour?  Feminist leader or 60 million year old extinct fossil?
[5/24/17, 12:19:29 PM] Justin: only thing i finding is she told women she wished they didnt ahve their vaginas
[5/24/17, 12:19:49 PM] Justin: unless you are in fact  aliberal snowflake, not conflicting with liberal ideals
[5/24/17, 12:19:56 PM] Dan Watts: She also just said the prophet Mohammad was a feminist. The same prophet who allows stoning women in the event of infidelity is a feminist
[5/24/17, 12:20:36 PM] Justin: well to whatever degree any of this is real, pretty sure he doenst "allow" that
[5/24/17, 12:20:49 PM] Miller: He might be, but nobody knows what he looks like
[5/24/17, 12:21:11 PM] Miller: Could be wearing a pink pussy hat for all we know
[5/24/17, 12:21:22 PM] Justin: you are starting with an uniformed premise and associating that to everything she says
[5/24/17, 12:21:31 PM] Miller: Ooouuuuuuu
[5/24/17, 12:21:46 PM] Justin: i mean by that same vlaue i can say same shit about christians and therefore all christian feminists
[5/24/17, 12:21:56 PM] Steve: Cue the Michael Jackson eating popcorn
[5/24/17, 12:22:04 PM] Steve: Gotta really save that
[5/24/17, 12:22:05 PM] Dan Watts: Stoning is in the Quran
[5/24/17, 12:22:05 PM] Miller: You're wack, you're twisted your girls a hoe
[5/24/17, 12:22:28 PM] Steve: She be like "so? I love my baby mama, I'll never let her go!"
[5/24/17, 12:22:50 PM] Justin: While religious texts often give examples both with and without stoning, the Quran does not prescribe stoning as a punishment for any crime, mentioning only lashing as punishment for adultery.
[5/24/17, 12:23:14 PM] Dan Watts: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajm
[5/24/17, 12:23:36 PM] Justin: No mention of stoning/Rajm or capital punishment for adultery is found in the Qur'an,[2] which (in Surah an-Nur) prescribes lashing as punishment for premarital and extramarital sex (zina).[7] For this reason some minority Muslim sects such as Kharijites found in Iraq, and Islamic Modernists such as the Quranists disagree with the legality of rajm.
[5/24/17, 12:23:40 PM] Justin: from your link
[5/24/17, 12:23:46 PM] Dan Watts: You think stoning doesn't happen today? Is that what you're saying?
[5/24/17, 12:23:52 PM] Justin: thats not at all what im saying
[5/24/17, 12:23:57 PM] Dan Watts: Ok
[5/24/17, 12:24:00 PM] Justin: you made a claim that muhammed advocated it
[5/24/17, 12:24:11 PM] Justin: i mean clearly if he was in fact real, he didnt
[5/24/17, 12:24:18 PM] Justin: cultures are what advovate it
[5/24/17, 12:24:21 PM] Steve: He actually made a claim that that feminist claimed it
[5/24/17, 12:24:26 PM] Justin: and those cultures happen to have bene converted to islam
[5/24/17, 12:24:26 PM] Steve: You gotta read better
[5/24/17, 12:24:44 PM] Justin: he also just said the prophet Mohammad was a feminist. The same prophet who allows stoning women in the event of infidelity is a feminist
[5/24/17, 12:24:47 PM] Dan Watts: "Cultures" under the authority of the Quran
[5/24/17, 12:24:54 PM] Justin: damn crushing it right now
[5/24/17, 12:25:02 PM] Justin: cultures using the authority of the quran
[5/24/17, 12:25:04 PM] Justin: yeh
[5/24/17, 12:25:14 PM] Dan Watts: Quran is an Islamic document no?
[5/24/17, 12:25:30 PM] Justin: but they are making laws that in no way reflec ton the document
[5/24/17, 12:25:34 PM] Steve: @16316620763
[5/24/17, 12:25:34 PM] Dan Watts: Are there non-Islamic cultures stoning women at the rate of Islamic "cultures"
[5/24/17, 12:26:02 PM] Justin: i stand by my point steve
[5/24/17, 12:26:22 PM] Justin: prophet=muhammed
[5/24/17, 12:26:32 PM] Justin: replace muhammend with profit ...read sentence
[5/24/17, 12:26:35 PM] Dan Watts: Isn't the quran the word of Muhammad? In the "modern" version stoning is not included but we can both agree that many Muslims don't follow that and still practice stoning
[5/24/17, 12:26:53 PM] Justin: there is no modern version of quran
[5/24/17, 12:27:02 PM] Justin: there arent like 9 qurans like the bible
[5/24/17, 12:27:14 PM] Justin: its one of the claims to fame as to authenticty of the rleigion by those who practice it
[5/24/17, 12:27:45 PM] Justin: plenty of example of putting women first in quran.  religion is passed down from the mother in the quran
[5/24/17, 12:27:57 PM] Dan Watts: Look at what countries have the most human rights transgressions and I'll let you tell me what the common theme is
[5/24/17, 12:27:58 PM] Justin: its a matriarchal structure
[5/24/17, 12:28:15 PM] Justin: resources and opresisv regimes?
[5/24/17, 12:28:37 PM] Justin: ok so why are you looking at other countires?
[5/24/17, 12:28:39 PM] Dan Watts: Or culture and religion
[5/24/17, 12:28:44 PM] Justin: why cant you looka t practicing muslims in america?
[5/24/17, 12:29:07 PM] Dan Watts: Because they pale in comparison to the rest of the world
[5/24/17, 12:29:17 PM] Miller: Look at deerborn Michigan
[5/24/17, 12:29:57 PM] Justin: well for one, i would argue we created a middle east structure wherein radicalism is the rulign power
[5/24/17, 12:30:38 PM] Justin: we destablized any country that attempted to give resources to the people and replaced them with hardliners that would oppress its people.  After that stopped working we just started chosing radical groups to take over
[5/24/17, 12:30:57 PM] Justin: becuase we want access to their resources----soooo
[5/24/17, 12:31:01 PM] Miller: How did we create the middle east
[5/24/17, 12:31:06 PM] Miller: It's way older
[5/24/17, 12:31:21 PM] Justin: well someone looked at  amap and said poof...middle east
[5/24/17, 12:31:32 PM] Justin: but if you want the long answer
[5/24/17, 12:31:42 PM] Miller: Idk seems obvious in hindsight
[5/24/17, 12:31:49 PM] Justin: which im sure you dont...it started with iran and its election of a secular socialist
[5/24/17, 12:32:07 PM] Launchpad: would have been much easier if our soldiers would have invented Etherium instead
[5/24/17, 12:32:17 PM] Justin: still dont know what etheirum is
[5/24/17, 12:32:34 PM] Miller: It's that movie with Matt Damon
[5/24/17, 12:32:38 PM] Justin: haha its litecoin
[5/24/17, 12:32:48 PM] Justin: what happened to litecoin...ehterium crushed it?
[5/24/17, 12:32:48 PM] Miller: He's bald
[5/24/17, 12:32:54 PM] Launchpad: yes
[5/24/17, 12:33:09 PM] Justin: good thing you didnt have investment in litecoin
[5/24/17, 12:33:35 PM] Launchpad: yeah litecoin only worth 1.6 billion
[5/24/17, 12:33:41 PM] Miller: Boom
[5/24/17, 12:33:52 PM] Justin: damn
[5/24/17, 12:33:53 PM] Launchpad: http://coinmarketcap.com/
[5/24/17, 12:34:22 PM] Miller: Hermowned‚Ñ¢
[5/24/17, 12:34:26 PM] Justin: e-coin
[5/24/17, 12:34:32 PM] Justin: lets do it
[5/24/17, 12:34:32 PM] Launchpad: the crypto economy is worth 85 billion
[5/24/17, 12:34:58 PM] Launchpad: E Coin already exists
[5/24/17, 12:35:07 PM] Justin: 50 billion disappeares overnight after us legalizes pot
[5/24/17, 12:35:09 PM] Launchpad: but its a centralized currency created by Evil Corp
[5/24/17, 12:35:13 PM] Launchpad: not the same
[5/24/17, 12:35:22 PM] Justin: i saw ecoin at number 100
[5/24/17, 12:35:24 PM] Launchpad: lol no
[5/24/17, 12:35:50 PM] Launchpad: lol I guess there is one
[5/24/17, 12:38:40 PM] Justin: i might jump on train soon...sux
[5/24/17, 12:39:03 PM] Justin: tehre is a foreign site that looks like its got a good amount of games, does cashouts in bbitcoin
[5/24/17, 12:39:08 PM] Launchpad: best time to jump on the train is after it already left the gate
[5/24/17, 12:39:14 PM] Justin: lol no choice really
[5/24/17, 12:39:25 PM] Justin: woudlnt hold it for long, not investment vehicale just way to cashout
[5/24/17, 12:39:48 PM] Justin: funny is i ddint want to join site couple momnths ago becuase thought bticoin to volatile
[5/24/17, 12:40:02 PM] Justin: now its up 100% and im gonna have to do it at liekly the worst time
[5/24/17, 12:41:28 PM] Justin: but form what i understand you can pay more to have transaction processed faster, which would lower amount of time i'm dealing with that volatility.  account is held in dollars, so its just the timeframe of cashout request-receive funds-convert to dollars that would involve having bitcoins
[5/24/17, 12:41:30 PM] Launchpad: you are so going to lose all your money
[5/24/17, 12:42:37 PM] Justin: probably
[5/24/17, 12:45:11 PM] Justin: you sell yours yet?
[5/24/17, 12:45:19 PM] Launchpad: some
[5/24/17, 12:45:31 PM] Justin: you rebuy?
[5/24/17, 12:46:05 PM] Launchpad: not at a higher price
[5/24/17, 12:46:16 PM] Launchpad: I sold off some at $1000 which was a big mistake
[5/24/17, 12:47:19 PM] Launchpad: Im going to try to catch the peak and cash out the rest, and rebuy later on
[5/24/17, 12:48:48 PM] Launchpad: going to roll a bunch into weed stocks
[5/24/17, 12:50:20 PM] Miller: always a good idea to sell at the peak
[5/24/17, 12:50:54 PM] Launchpad: i don't know who that is
[5/24/17, 12:50:56 PM] Launchpad: calling the top is not easy though
[5/24/17, 12:51:08 PM] Justin: think that was the implication
[5/24/17, 12:51:09 PM] Launchpad: whos to say it would double again first?
[5/24/17, 12:52:18 PM] Launchpad: while all these alt coins are going crazy, they are typically traded back into bitcoin before cashing out
[5/24/17, 12:52:37 PM] Launchpad: so we could still see an awesome move out of the alts back into BTC before BTC crashes
[5/24/17, 12:54:09 PM] Justin: i read it had something to do with japan
[5/24/17, 12:54:17 PM] Justin: japan is making up like 60% of the trades
[5/24/17, 12:54:38 PM] Launchpad: Japan made it a legal currency
[5/24/17, 1:05:13 PM] Dan Watts: http://pix11.com/2017/05/23/man-claiming-girlfriend-accidentally-choked-to-death-during-oral-sex-found-not-guilty-of-murder/

[5/24/17, 1:08:32 PM] Justin: intentiaonal pun
[5/24/17, 1:09:07 PM] Miller: so dumb
[5/24/17, 1:09:25 PM] Miller: i would guarantee nobody has ever died like that accidentally in the history of the world
[5/24/17, 1:10:26 PM] Justin: yeh without there dicks being bit off
[5/24/17, 1:11:18 PM] Miller: right if she had bit his dick off and then choked on it i would buy it
[5/24/17, 3:13:21 PM] Launchpad: Do they sell the Liquor/beer wine sign on Amazon or something? I feel like I've seen the exact same one in my neighborhood
[5/24/17, 4:27:41 PM] Steve: Side note, baywatch is getting killed
[5/24/17, 4:36:04 PM] Dan Watts: Get us tix wtf

[5/24/17, 5:49:48 PM] Steve: You two cropped out Herman IRL
[5/24/17, 5:50:07 PM] Steve: Poor guy

[5/25/17, 6:25:33 PM] Miller: Lpt I hadn't thought of before but if you are parking your car in a lot where you one of the attendants takes it and parks it take pictures beforehand, I saw 2 people's cars come back fucked up (one with a massive dent) while waiting for mine last weekend and they basically were like wasn't us, prove it
[5/25/17, 6:26:37 PM] Scott: Or have camera in car

[5/25/17, 6:30:33 PM] Launchpad: except when it looked like genocide
[5/25/17, 6:32:32 PM] Justin: dk if thats a mao reference, a tibet reference, or birth policy reference.....probably bad sign for china
[5/25/17, 6:33:05 PM] Launchpad: lol
[5/25/17, 6:33:47 PM] Launchpad: the working class of china may have plenty of jobs, but who do you think they're working for?
[5/25/17, 6:33:51 PM] Launchpad: American corporations
[5/25/17, 6:34:04 PM] Justin: yeh i mean thats much deeper conversation as china is technically capitalist
[5/25/17, 6:34:22 PM] Launchpad: that too
[5/25/17, 6:34:43 PM] Justin: prett ymuch communism for the workers and capitalism for govt
[5/25/17, 6:34:50 PM] Launchpad: and they love bitcoin over there
[5/25/17, 6:35:34 PM] Justin: but yeh china owes most its success to forced wages and other draconian labor laws

[5/25/17, 7:50:50 PM] Justin: how is she not knocking over the cups?
[5/25/17, 7:51:18 PM] Steve: Also I don't know how real that it
[5/25/17, 7:51:22 PM] Steve: *is
[5/25/17, 7:51:27 PM] Miller: Idk but that video looks edited, I don't think she did it in one take
[5/25/17, 7:51:35 PM] Steve: No shot
[5/25/17, 7:51:42 PM] Steve: That's completely edited
[5/25/17, 7:51:46 PM] Steve: But still awesome
[5/25/17, 7:51:48 PM] Justin: lol cleatry editd but that would be such a pain in the ass having to rerack
[5/25/17, 7:52:06 PM] Steve: Why would she have to rerack?
[5/25/17, 7:52:14 PM] Justin: its a gold ball im assuming
[5/25/17, 7:52:16 PM] Steve: Just keep shooting at it until you make the cup
[5/25/17, 7:52:19 PM] Steve: Then move on
[5/25/17, 7:52:23 PM] Steve: It is not lol
[5/25/17, 7:52:24 PM] Justin: thats not a ping pong
[5/25/17, 7:52:31 PM] Justin: really thats a fucken ping pong?
[5/25/17, 7:52:33 PM] Steve: It's def not a good ball
[5/25/17, 7:52:38 PM] Steve: Might be
[5/25/17, 7:52:42 PM] Steve: *gold
[5/25/17, 7:52:48 PM] Steve: It's something relatively light
[5/25/17, 7:52:54 PM] Justin: pong would fly all over place after hitting gold club
[5/25/17, 7:53:04 PM] Steve: That wouldn't knock a full cup of water down
[5/25/17, 7:53:21 PM] Steve: Maybe it's a heavier pong ball
[5/25/17, 7:53:34 PM] Steve: Hay can def bounce on the club
[5/25/17, 7:53:37 PM] Miller: I doubt it's a gold ball
[5/25/17, 7:53:38 PM] Steve: *that
[5/25/17, 7:53:44 PM] Justin: we need an asnwer
[5/25/17, 7:53:49 PM] Justin: someone tweet her
[5/25/17, 7:53:48 PM] Miller: Would be too heavy
[5/25/17, 7:54:01 PM] Steve: It's instagram herm
[5/25/17, 7:54:03 PM] Justin: dont care steve
[5/25/17, 7:54:05 PM] Steve: You really should know
[5/25/17, 7:54:12 PM] Steve: Don't worry, I won't tell joya
[5/25/17, 7:54:24 PM] Justin: preempted you with the dont care
[5/25/17, 7:54:33 PM] Justin: realized it as i said it like an old man
[5/25/17, 7:54:40 PM] Justin: knew you were coming for me
[5/25/17, 7:54:40 PM] Steve: It also says the word instagram first
[5/25/17, 7:55:01 PM] Steve: As you would come for me boo
[5/25/17, 7:55:51 PM] ‚ÄéMiller changed this group's icon
[5/25/17, 7:55:56 PM] Donk: Would probably dent the ball hitting it anyway
[5/25/17, 7:56:13 PM] Justin: but ping pong bounces more erratic
[5/25/17, 7:56:13 PM] Miller: Such an appropriate icon lol
[5/25/17, 7:56:51 PM] Miller: Maybe it's platinum
[5/25/17, 7:57:22 PM] Miller: Or quartz, gotta consider quartz
[5/25/17, 8:11:22 PM] Steve: For her sake, I hope it's a nickname
[5/25/17, 8:31:18 PM] Justin: well...
[5/25/17, 9:15:58 PM] Justin: lol always like olberman
[5/25/17, 9:16:05 PM] Justin: and cherry what sounds interesting
[5/25/17, 9:18:07 PM] Steve: I have a 6 pack of home brew with your name on it

[5/26/17, 6:24:38 AM] Brian Katz: Well that show is done
[5/26/17, 8:29:04 AM] Steve: I think this offseason will change things
[5/26/17, 8:29:23 AM] Steve: But I'd agree the past three years have been a foregone conclusion
[5/26/17, 8:29:45 AM] Steve: I think celtics get a great player at 1 and trade for butler
[5/26/17, 8:29:53 AM] Steve: Or someone of his caliber
[5/26/17, 8:30:03 AM] Steve: Make it a 3 team race
[5/26/17, 8:30:22 AM] Steve: And kawahi also comes back next year making the spurs much better
[5/26/17, 8:30:28 AM] Steve: So 4
[5/26/17, 8:32:56 AM] Brian Katz: It'll be the cavs vs the warriors next year too
[5/26/17, 8:33:18 AM] Brian Katz: With 14 other teams catching a lop sided beat down
[5/26/17, 8:33:22 AM] Steve: I'll make that bet after the offseason
[5/26/17, 8:33:30 AM] Steve: Just want to see how teams change
[5/26/17, 8:33:43 AM] Brian Katz: As long as there isn't any radical changes
[5/26/17, 8:33:55 AM] Brian Katz: Durant is gay for what he did
[5/26/17, 8:34:16 AM] Brian Katz: Made the competitive west a one team conference
[5/26/17, 8:34:46 AM] Steve: I think celtics have radical changes
[5/26/17, 8:34:54 AM] Steve: May trade Isaiah
[5/26/17, 8:35:00 AM] Steve: Depending on who they draft
[5/26/17, 8:38:00 AM] Scott: I told u this last night
[5/26/17, 8:38:12 AM] Scott: U are making it like u just came up with this
[5/26/17, 8:38:15 AM] Steve: And I agreed
[5/26/17, 8:38:35 AM] Steve: Also figured they'd trade for butler and would have to give him up
[5/26/17, 8:38:40 AM] Steve: No
[5/26/17, 8:38:53 AM] Steve: And you didn't find up with that either
[5/26/17, 8:39:05 AM] Steve: *come
[5/26/17, 8:39:15 AM] Steve: I've heard that before
[5/26/17, 8:39:41 AM] Brian Katz: Why would they trade Isaiah?
[5/26/17, 8:40:11 AM] Scott: Better team continuity
[5/26/17, 8:40:23 AM] Scott: Avery Bradley more valuable as defender
[5/26/17, 8:40:34 AM] Scott: Marcus smart has a lot of talent and can play pg
[5/26/17, 8:40:54 AM] Steve: I also don't think bulls trade butler for anyone other than Isaiah
[5/26/17, 8:40:59 AM] Scott: Would allow them to improve at other positions and get draft picks to acquire butler or george
[5/26/17, 8:41:17 AM] Steve: George is a free agent
[5/26/17, 8:41:22 AM] Steve: They don't need to acquire him
[5/26/17, 8:41:29 AM] Scott: Sign and trade and it's possible
[5/26/17, 8:41:43 AM] Scott: Celtics need a starting center
[5/26/17, 8:41:46 AM] Steve: I don't think they need to do that
[5/26/17, 8:41:56 AM] Scott: Soreu
[5/26/17, 8:41:58 AM] Scott: Pf
[5/26/17, 8:42:01 AM] Steve: I think they can sign him because he doesn't want to stay on the pacers
[5/26/17, 8:42:20 AM] Scott: Could move jaylen Brown also for a veteran
[5/26/17, 8:42:27 AM] Scott: Even though I like him alot
[5/26/17, 8:43:01 AM] Steve: Anyway, I do think the level of competition will rise this summer
[5/26/17, 8:43:19 AM] Steve: Also depends on where Blake and Paul end up
[5/26/17, 8:45:02 AM] Donk: I dont think chicago would give up butler for thomas1
[5/26/17, 8:45:13 AM] Donk: Maybe the first pick
[5/26/17, 8:46:27 AM] Scott: They'd have to get more
[5/26/17, 8:46:29 AM] Scott: I agree
[5/26/17, 8:46:42 AM] Scott: Maybe Thomas and jaylen Brown for him
[5/26/17, 8:46:45 AM] Steve: I think if they give them their second first
[5/26/17, 8:46:52 AM] Steve: And Isaiah it's enough
[5/26/17, 8:47:29 AM] Donk: As to them getting a great player in the draft, its really pg heavy st the top, which arguably they don't need
[5/26/17, 8:47:49 AM] Donk: Even with fultz, they arent competing with cleveland or golden state
[5/26/17, 8:47:56 AM] Donk: Or butler for that matter
[5/26/17, 8:48:05 AM] Scott: With butler or helps alot
[5/26/17, 8:48:09 AM] Scott: They need a better pf
[5/26/17, 8:48:25 AM] Steve: If they have faultz and butler
[5/26/17, 8:48:27 AM] Scott: Butler is a plus plus defender and elite player
[5/26/17, 8:48:42 AM] Donk: Still dont think butler and fultz makes them a legit threat
[5/26/17, 8:48:45 AM] Scott: Smart fultz butler new pf horford
[5/26/17, 8:48:55 AM] Scott: With Bradley on the bench to steer
[5/26/17, 8:48:56 AM] Scott: Start
[5/26/17, 8:48:57 AM] Steve: I think it makes them better than they are now
[5/26/17, 8:48:59 AM] Scott: Come on now
[5/26/17, 8:49:11 AM] Donk: Still dont think its enough
[5/26/17, 8:49:12 AM] Steve: Which is more than 1 win against the cabs
[5/26/17, 8:49:18 AM] Steve: *cavs
[5/26/17, 8:49:22 AM] Steve: Also the spurs
[5/26/17, 8:49:40 AM] Steve: Will be improved and have everyone healthy
[5/26/17, 8:49:43 AM] Donk: Spurs dont have cap room to sign another star
[5/26/17, 8:50:03 AM] Donk: Even with a healthy leonard,  its not enough
[5/26/17, 8:50:10 AM] Steve: They lose Ginobili and gasol this offseason
[5/26/17, 8:50:20 AM] Donk: Gasol isnt going anywhere
[5/26/17, 8:50:33 AM] Donk: He has a 16mil option hes going to pick up
[5/26/17, 8:51:31 AM] Donk: Which stops them from signing a star
[5/26/17, 8:53:05 AM] Steve: So next year he cap is at 102
[5/26/17, 8:53:19 AM] Steve: With the luxury cap tax not kicking in until 122
[5/26/17, 8:53:28 AM] Steve: Spurs are at 94 million this year
[5/26/17, 8:53:37 AM] Steve: They lose 14 million from ginobili
[5/26/17, 8:53:43 AM] Donk: You can't sign free agent players over the cap
[5/26/17, 8:53:50 AM] Steve: They wouldn't be
[5/26/17, 8:54:03 AM] Steve: They'd be 22 million under
[5/26/17, 8:54:10 AM] Steve: Even with gasols 16
[5/26/17, 8:54:26 AM] Donk: I was reading an article about this yesterday. If gasol picks up his option,  they only have like 10-12mil in space
[5/26/17, 8:55:06 AM] Steve: Well he made 15.5 this year
[5/26/17, 8:55:08 AM] Donk: Even so, what are they going to do? Add chris paul? Dude csnt win a playoff series anyway
[5/26/17, 8:55:13 AM] Steve: And would make 16.2 next
[5/26/17, 8:55:24 AM] Steve: That guys math is wrong
[5/26/17, 8:55:40 AM] Donk: Yeah, the nba writer doesnt know but you do
[5/26/17, 8:55:44 AM] Steve: Parker comes back so no room for Paul
[5/26/17, 8:56:03 AM] Steve: I mean I have the numbers in front of me
[5/26/17, 8:56:12 AM] Steve: I can screen shot it tonyou if you'd like
[5/26/17, 8:56:22 AM] Donk: All of them? Including the raises every player has in their deals?
[5/26/17, 8:56:52 AM] Donk: Im going to trust the people who do it for a living
[5/26/17, 8:57:19 AM] Donk: But lets say you are right (you arent), who are they signing who is going to take them over the hump?
[5/26/17, 8:57:31 AM] Donk: Blake or paul doesnt add much to that team
[5/26/17, 8:57:36 AM] Donk: Neither does hayward
[5/26/17, 8:57:43 AM] Donk: Those are the big 3 free agents
[5/26/17, 8:57:45 AM] Steve: I think kawahi being healthy would have brought that series to at least 6
[5/26/17, 8:58:01 AM] Steve: And Parker being in may have brought it to 7
[5/26/17, 8:58:14 AM] Donk: I disagree
[5/26/17, 8:58:41 AM] Steve: So they don't need another max player
[5/26/17, 8:58:52 AM] Steve: But they have flexibility
[5/26/17, 8:59:03 AM] Steve: I'd also have to look at the free agents
[5/26/17, 8:59:13 AM] Steve: Don't know who else is it their other than he big names
[5/26/17, 8:59:20 AM] Steve: *there
[5/26/17, 8:59:28 AM] Donk: Looked it up, spurs have 95mil in salary next year and thats with manu already counted out
[5/26/17, 8:59:50 AM] Donk: So thats 7mil in room
[5/26/17, 9:00:00 AM] Steve: So I was off by 1 million
[5/26/17, 9:00:04 AM] Steve: Sorry for the mistake
[5/26/17, 9:00:15 AM] Donk: Yeah but you said 94 minis 14 for manu
[5/26/17, 9:00:29 AM] Donk: But its 94 without manu alreadt
[5/26/17, 9:00:34 AM] Donk: You were off by 15 mil
[5/26/17, 9:00:42 AM] Donk: 95 i mean
[5/26/17, 9:01:29 AM] Donk: So yeah, it doesnt matter cause they can't sign anyone anyway
[5/26/17, 9:03:04 AM] Steve: Holy shit they have a shit ton of contracts who jump a bunch
[5/26/17, 9:03:14 AM] Steve: And they are still paying Duncan
[5/26/17, 9:03:35 AM] Steve: Wow
[5/26/17, 9:03:39 AM] Steve: My mistake
[5/26/17, 9:03:52 AM] Steve: I though it was 95 or 94 with ginobili
[5/26/17, 9:04:21 AM] Donk: So the spurs are out are legit contenders
[5/26/17, 9:04:33 AM] Steve: I don't believe that but fine
[5/26/17, 9:12:41 AM] Kiyoon: Steve at least you didn't make a $2 Trillion mistake
[5/26/17, 9:12:58 AM] Steve: 14 million is still pretty bad
[5/26/17, 9:13:28 AM] Steve: I also just assumed that everyone was making the same next year but that was a very bad assumption
[5/26/17, 10:09:04 AM] Scott: boom quoted on uber today.
[5/26/17, 10:49:18 AM] Launchpad: MassRoots, Inc. (OTCQB: MSRT), a leading technology platform for medical cannabis patients and businesses, is pleased to announce it has launched an activist celebrity influencer campaign to help accelerate its user growth. One of the world's most renowned cannabis consumers, Snoop Dogg (Snoop), has started to drive his 17 million Instagram fans and followers to join the MassRoots platform as one of the first influencers in the program.

"As we scale our user base towards two million users, we're looking to leverage the following and influence of pro-cannabis celebrities to help break MassRoots into the mainstream," said MassRoots Chief Executive Officer Isaac Dietrich. "Snoop's extensive following can undoubtedly help take MassRoots and the legalization movement to the next level as we look to expand our market share in the rapidly growing cannabis industry."

[5/30/17, 10:06:37 AM] Brian Katz: People are stupid, to care about a statue that much either way.
[5/30/17, 10:16:41 AM] Scott: Statue üöî
[5/30/17, 10:17:50 AM] Miller: guy who placed statue w/o permission mad a corporation strategically placed a statue w/o permission as a means of viral marketing is now mad someone else placed another statue w/o permission undermining that statue
[5/30/17, 10:37:49 AM] Steve: And her purposely made it a shitty statue
[5/30/17, 10:37:50 AM] Steve: Lol
[5/30/17, 10:38:00 AM] Steve: Which is even worse because he's an actual artist
[5/30/17, 10:38:10 AM] Steve: Who should care about every piece of work he creates
[5/30/17, 10:45:46 AM] Brian Katz: Do not praise false idols son
[5/30/17, 10:49:37 AM] Steve: I don't know what you are talking about
[5/30/17, 10:50:41 AM] Brian Katz: It's pretty clear
[5/30/17, 10:50:48 AM] Steve: Not really
[5/30/17, 10:50:53 AM] Steve: Who am I praising?
[5/30/17, 10:51:42 AM] Brian Katz: Not you in general
[5/30/17, 10:52:51 AM] Steve: What would be a "true idol"?
[5/30/17, 10:55:18 AM] Steve: Correction...
[5/30/17, 11:31:44 AM] Launchpad: wow I am so motivated
[5/30/17, 11:31:54 AM] Launchpad: to be the best baby I can be!!!
[5/30/17, 11:32:31 AM] Steve: You already are a champ at that
[5/30/17, 11:32:48 AM] Steve: Hence Hermans white privilege comments to you constantly
[5/30/17, 12:06:15 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/scary-connection-cake-cancer-214050456.html
[5/30/17, 12:07:35 PM] Steve: Glad you got roped into one of those "(fill in whatever) give you cancer"
[5/30/17, 12:07:40 PM] Steve: You're better than that
[5/30/17, 12:09:52 PM] Justin: I mean is it?
[5/30/17, 12:11:03 PM] Justin: Seems like it's decently grounded in science. Not saying it's clear cut, but that more study needs to go into it and that cancer treatment, for these specific hard to treat cancers, can be developed if it is true
[5/30/17, 12:11:49 PM] Justin: Thought lp and katz would like it as it's another reason to avoid sugars.
[5/30/17, 12:12:22 PM] Donk: Speaking of sugar and cancer, the pet scan, which is a full body type csncer scan that shows where cancers are located in your body, works because cancer cells eat up more sugar than the surrounding ones. So they shoot you full of radioactive sugar and then scan your body to see where the most sugar had been consumed. Its pretty cool
[5/30/17, 12:13:00 PM] Justin: So there you go, definitely a scientific correlation
[5/30/17, 12:13:31 PM] Justin: They should just make you eat a whole thing of cotton candy before  the test
[5/30/17, 12:13:51 PM] Donk: Well doesnt quite work like that
[5/30/17, 12:13:53 PM] Steve: Oh I'm sure it is based on science
[5/30/17, 12:14:02 PM] Steve: But if you watch local news outlets every night
[5/30/17, 12:14:07 PM] Donk: And you can find a link between anything and it causing cancer
[5/30/17, 12:14:15 PM] Steve: Guaranteed everything you eat on a daily basis can cause cancer
[5/30/17, 12:14:18 PM] Justin: Well yeh just because cancer consumes sugar doesn't mean that their is a causative effect with consuming sugar
[5/30/17, 12:14:23 PM] Steve: Literally every night
[5/30/17, 12:14:26 PM] Donk: Best way to not get cancer is to not be alive
[5/30/17, 12:14:34 PM] Steve: ^preciselt
[5/30/17, 12:14:38 PM] Brian Katz: I love cake, fuck
[5/30/17, 12:14:40 PM] Steve: *precisely
[5/30/17, 12:14:41 PM] Justin: Why I went with *correlation
[5/30/17, 12:14:56 PM] Steve: But they make that correlation with soooooo many things a
[5/30/17, 12:15:17 PM] Justin: But if these types of cancers rely on sugar, starving the cancer could kill it
[5/30/17, 12:15:24 PM] Steve: Milk, eggs, bacon, meat, poultry
[5/30/17, 12:15:56 PM] Steve: Gatorade, michigans water supply
[5/30/17, 12:16:05 PM] Justin: Still doesn't mean that by avoiding sugar  you wouldn't get the cancer.
[5/30/17, 12:16:06 PM] Steve: The air
[5/30/17, 12:16:12 PM] Steve: Walking into a Taco Bell
[5/30/17, 12:16:17 PM] Steve: Parking in a Taco Bell
[5/30/17, 12:16:30 PM] Donk: You leave taco bell out of this
[5/30/17, 12:16:35 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/30/17, 12:16:42 PM] Donk: Put some respek on its name
[5/30/17, 12:16:52 PM] Steve: I guarantee a google search will turn up one study that it causes cancer
[5/30/17, 12:17:12 PM] Donk: That is a google search i would never do
[5/30/17, 12:17:39 PM] Justin: Fair but an entire industry made the same argument you are Steve.
[5/30/17, 12:17:39 PM] Donk: Its similar to how people only die of aids once they kbow they have it so you shouldnt get tested
[5/30/17, 12:18:18 PM] Justin: No way to prove people who smoke wouldn't have gotten cancer
[5/30/17, 12:18:33 PM] Justin: It could be a million other things they do
[5/30/17, 12:19:06 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/30/17, 12:19:07 PM] Steve: Yes
[5/30/17, 12:19:18 PM] Steve: My argument is the same as Tabasco companies lying to people
[5/30/17, 12:19:30 PM] Steve: It's the same
[5/30/17, 12:20:01 PM] Justin: Also the article title may be misleading, but sugar is a much broader category than cake
[5/30/17, 12:20:04 PM] Steve: Multi billion dollar corporations saying that cigarettes don't cause cancer and me saying that many many things can cause cancer is he same
[5/30/17, 12:20:14 PM] Justin: That's their argument
[5/30/17, 12:20:22 PM] Miller: god damn big tabasco has been covering it up
[5/30/17, 12:20:23 PM] Steve: No it wasn't
[5/30/17, 12:20:32 PM] Steve: They actually denied their products gave anyone cancer
[5/30/17, 12:20:44 PM] Brian Katz: Fuck I love Tabasco too
[5/30/17, 12:20:46 PM] Steve: Literally said, "nope, cigarettes are good"
[5/30/17, 12:21:02 PM] Miller: rough day for you katz
[5/30/17, 12:21:18 PM] Launchpad: theres no evidence that shows that eating foods which make you feel good are good for you, and eating foods which make you feel like shit afterwards (like food loaded in sugar) are bad for you
[5/30/17, 12:21:24 PM] Steve: Maybe @16318489683 should start praising false idols
[5/30/17, 12:21:37 PM] Launchpad: just eat whatever you want, cancer doesn't exist #fakenews
[5/30/17, 12:21:41 PM] Brian Katz: I'm going to quit this chat if you guys keep killing my favorite eats lol
[5/30/17, 12:22:02 PM] Steve: Blame science
[5/30/17, 12:22:27 PM] Brian Katz: Science didn't post that news in this chat
[5/30/17, 12:22:41 PM] Steve: Hermans middle name is science
[5/30/17, 12:24:56 PM] Justin: Well now that lp has completely bastardized my claim
[5/30/17, 12:25:13 PM] Steve: Oh damn
[5/30/17, 12:25:15 PM] Justin: I personally fee great after eating sugar, so I suppose it's great for me
[5/30/17, 12:25:22 PM] Steve: Get out the Michael Jackson popcorn
[5/30/17, 12:26:50 PM] Justin: Something could be high in fiber and make me run to the bathroom in agony, now that implies it's bad for me?
[5/30/17, 12:27:56 PM] Launchpad: theres a difference between something that runs through you and something that makes you feel pain and agony
[5/30/17, 12:28:00 PM] Justin: by those standards, food that tastes bad = bad for you
[5/30/17, 12:28:19 PM] Justin: take cacau---why would my taste buds tell me that shit is gross if its so amazing for me
[5/30/17, 12:28:21 PM] Launchpad: call me crazy, but if I eat something that makes me feel pain and agony, I assume its bad for me
[5/30/17, 12:28:44 PM] Justin: not crazy and you cna do what you want, doesn't mean its a factual statement
[5/30/17, 12:29:02 PM] Justin: why does sugar make you fele pain and agony?
[5/30/17, 12:29:10 PM] Justin: ive never eaten a hersehy bar and cried after
[5/30/17, 12:29:25 PM] Justin: although plenty of women have im sure
[5/30/17, 12:29:27 PM] Launchpad: For example -  corn chips.  I ate a shitload of chips and salsa yesterday, and paid the price on the toilet this morning
[5/30/17, 12:29:50 PM] Justin: but if you ate those everyday your body would adjust
[5/30/17, 12:29:57 PM] Launchpad: false
[5/30/17, 12:30:02 PM] Justin: ok
[5/30/17, 12:30:10 PM] Justin: so doess your body feel like shit after eating a kit kat?
[5/30/17, 12:30:11 PM] Launchpad: and I would get fat too
[5/30/17, 12:30:24 PM] Justin: well, the fat part ss true
[5/30/17, 12:30:41 PM] Launchpad: and as we all no, being fat has no impact on your health
[5/30/17, 12:30:45 PM] Launchpad: **know
[5/30/17, 12:30:55 PM] Launchpad: if its just one Im sure Ill be fine -- but if I binge on candy Ill feel like shit
[5/30/17, 12:30:58 PM] Justin: well thats fine
[5/30/17, 12:31:04 PM] Launchpad: and it will be an uncomfortable poop
[5/30/17, 12:31:05 PM] Justin: but thats not what the implication is
[5/30/17, 12:31:21 PM] Justin: im sure at random there is almost no distinguisahble difference between your body reacting to good versus bad food
[5/30/17, 12:31:34 PM] Launchpad: yet when I followed the 4 hour diet everyday, I never had an issues with digestive discomfort, bloating, or gas
[5/30/17, 12:31:37 PM] Justin: you are just making that distinction, you will avoid good foods that make you feel like shit
[5/30/17, 12:31:51 PM] Launchpad: good foods don't make me feel like shit
[5/30/17, 12:31:59 PM] Miller: just the thought of eating kale makes me want to kill myself
[5/30/17, 12:32:04 PM] Justin: so protein powder doesnt bloat you?
[5/30/17, 12:32:05 PM] Launchpad: its the foods that get me fat.  this isn't rocket science
[5/30/17, 12:32:09 PM] Launchpad: no
[5/30/17, 12:32:12 PM] Justin: beucase it bloats alot of people
[5/30/17, 12:32:27 PM] Launchpad: then they should find a powder that doesn't bloat them
[5/30/17, 12:32:39 PM] Justin: but thats not what your argument implies
[5/30/17, 12:33:06 PM] Justin: anotherwords if 9/10 protein powders taste and feel great...1 makes you blaoted
[5/30/17, 12:33:12 PM] Justin: you are implying that 1 is bad for you?
[5/30/17, 12:33:35 PM] Launchpad: 3 things is all I did to change my life
[5/30/17, 12:33:36 PM] Launchpad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81P_afh2x5k
[5/30/17, 12:34:19 PM] Justin: thought that was from requiem
[5/30/17, 12:34:36 PM] Launchpad: if 9/10 brands make me feel ok and 1 brand makes me feel bloated -- I will avoid that one brand.  Its common sense
[5/30/17, 12:35:00 PM] Justin: yes  i get that but it still udnermines your asusmption
[5/30/17, 12:35:16 PM] Justin: you are asusming feeling bloated= bad
[5/30/17, 12:35:31 PM] Justin: but the composition of all 10 of those proteins is nearly identical...
[5/30/17, 12:35:39 PM] Justin: liekly long term effects of them is nearly identical
[5/30/17, 12:36:41 PM] Justin: but im on baord iwth you.  if some shit makes you feel blaoted or gassy and you can substitute it for something of equal nutrtinal value.. its common sense to do that
[5/30/17, 12:57:15 PM] Launchpad: they are obviously not identical if 1 consistently makes you feel a certain way
[5/30/17, 12:57:40 PM] Launchpad: in theory they are supposed to be the same, but quality control mattes
[5/30/17, 12:57:44 PM] Launchpad: matters
[5/30/17, 12:58:11 PM] Launchpad: For example: beef thats injected with steriods vs beef that isn't
[5/30/17, 12:58:31 PM] Launchpad: you can't just say its the same thing cause its beef
[5/30/17, 1:00:07 PM] Launchpad: More importantly:
[5/30/17, 1:00:32 PM] Justin: still ending at a result, that doesnt imply a better result... I.E pain relief can excaerbate a problem
[5/30/17, 1:00:48 PM] Miller: ugh s2 was such a chore to get through
[5/30/17, 1:00:53 PM] Justin: saw that the other day, gave up on that show after episode 2
[5/30/17, 1:00:55 PM] Miller: not looking forward to eventually powering through s3
[5/30/17, 1:01:04 PM] Launchpad: nah season 2 was awesome
[5/30/17, 1:01:07 PM] Miller: at least its ending
[5/30/17, 1:01:28 PM] Launchpad: im so glad they are closing it out proper and didn't just cancel it outright with no resolution
[5/30/17, 1:01:54 PM] Miller: as much as i hate things being unresolved i would have been okay w/saving the 10 hours of my life theyre now going to waste
[5/30/17, 1:02:10 PM] Launchpad: no way season 2 was good
[5/30/17, 1:16:25 PM] Steve: I haven't gotten into season 2 yet
[5/30/17, 1:16:36 PM] Steve: Think I watched first episode and knew it would drag
[5/30/17, 1:16:46 PM] Steve: Just finished orange and master of one

[5/30/17, 6:55:35 PM] Steve: My vneck is embarrassing
[5/30/17, 6:56:35 PM] Launchpad: as is your lack of chest hair
[5/30/17, 6:56:49 PM] Steve: Don't know if I was shaving it back then
[5/30/17, 6:56:55 PM] Steve: Probably
[5/30/17, 6:57:15 PM] Steve: Because I def don't lack body hair
[5/30/17, 7:32:07 PM] Justin: Low t levels likely
[5/30/17, 7:36:19 PM] Steve: I would assume
[5/30/17, 7:36:22 PM] Steve: Or too much sugar
[5/30/17, 7:40:37 PM] Justin: You have cancer also?
[5/30/17, 10:07:22 PM] Steve: Guess he's only a team player as a player
[5/30/17, 10:12:10 PM] Miller: Except for that time he made the best player in the sport switch positions so he didn't have to
[5/30/17, 10:12:35 PM] Steve: That's your take on it
[5/30/17, 10:13:09 PM] Steve: And Joe buddens
[5/30/17, 10:13:35 PM] Miller: Certainly mine, cannot speak for Joseph Budden
[5/30/17, 10:14:55 PM] Steve: Pretty sure it's a line in broken wings
[5/30/17, 10:16:37 PM] Miller: Ah yes the Yankees def jam jeter as jayz metaphor
[5/30/17, 10:16:47 PM] Steve: Yes sir
[5/31/17, 6:28:49 AM] Miller: Solid start to the day, total covfefe on this train
[5/31/17, 6:30:07 AM] Steve: I don't know what that means
[5/31/17, 6:30:22 AM] Scott: I can't determine if that's bad or not
[5/31/17, 7:45:48 AM] Steve: Anyone want to get tickets to this nas/lauryn hill tour?
[5/31/17, 7:47:45 AM] Miller: no local shows
[5/31/17, 7:51:01 AM] Steve: Damn
[5/31/17, 7:51:08 AM] Scott: Steve and I are fighting
[5/31/17, 7:51:12 AM] Scott: I owe Steve money
[5/31/17, 7:51:17 AM] Scott: For dinner
[5/31/17, 7:51:27 AM] Scott: Ordered on his seamless app
[5/31/17, 7:51:30 AM] Steve: Which he thought he paid for
[5/31/17, 7:51:32 AM] Scott: I am willing to pay right now
[5/31/17, 7:51:38 AM] Scott: I just don't remember how much
[5/31/17, 7:51:38 AM] Steve: Which cheese also has
[5/31/17, 7:51:40 AM] Scott: Steve won't tell me
[5/31/17, 7:51:49 AM] Scott: And now I'm stuck
[5/31/17, 7:51:56 AM] Scott: And I said I'd pay him right now
[5/31/17, 7:51:59 AM] Steve: Cheese wants me to go back to an app that he has and calculate the total for him
[5/31/17, 7:52:01 AM] Scott: But I don't know how much
[5/31/17, 7:52:09 AM] Scott: Bro u ordered from your app
[5/31/17, 7:52:15 AM] Scott: I don't remember how much it was
[5/31/17, 7:52:17 AM] Steve: But you have the same app!
[5/31/17, 7:52:19 AM] Scott: Just tell me
[5/31/17, 7:52:24 AM] Scott: If doesn't say what i ordered
[5/31/17, 7:52:32 AM] Scott: If it did I'd check it
[5/31/17, 7:52:43 AM] Scott: Ur being a child.
[5/31/17, 7:52:51 AM] Steve: If you search the restaurant and look at the menu, it does
[5/31/17, 7:52:57 AM] Scott: No it doesn't
[5/31/17, 7:53:00 AM] Scott: U ordered on your app
[5/31/17, 7:53:05 AM] Scott: Your app records the order
[5/31/17, 7:53:05 AM] Steve: You are being typical lazy cheese
[5/31/17, 7:53:08 AM] Scott: Not mine
[5/31/17, 7:53:09 AM] Steve: And a bit cheap
[5/31/17, 7:53:20 AM] Scott: Mine has no idea
[5/31/17, 7:53:36 AM] Scott: Stop trolling me u douchebag it's not even 8 ak
[5/31/17, 7:53:38 AM] Scott: Am
[5/31/17, 7:53:48 AM] Steve: It's 7:53
[5/31/17, 7:53:57 AM] Steve: You'll be ok in the next 7 minutes as well
[5/31/17, 7:55:17 AM] Steve: I feel like we are retraining him as a man
[5/31/17, 7:55:32 AM] Miller: i say you estimate what he owes you and then add a 20% laziness/cheese tax to it
[5/31/17, 7:55:36 AM] Steve: Come on cheese! You got this!
[5/31/17, 7:55:44 AM] Steve: That I would agree to
[5/31/17, 7:55:45 AM] Miller: see if that incentives him to figure it out himself
[5/31/17, 7:56:02 AM] Steve: Now I'm just not checking my order history in principal
[5/31/17, 7:56:20 AM] Miller: steve has a strict no receipt showing policy
[5/31/17, 7:57:18 AM] Steve: The freedom of information act aight got shit on me!
[5/31/17, 8:03:49 AM] Kiyoon: What type of food was it
[5/31/17, 8:36:06 AM] Brian Katz: Just give him $15
[5/31/17, 8:43:22 AM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 8:43:59 AM] Steve: The point is cheese first thought he paid, then asked me to calculate it for him. Again. And now thinks it's my problem.
[5/31/17, 8:44:12 AM] Steve: Also it was delicious diner food
[5/31/17, 8:44:34 AM] Steve: And weirdly he ordered stuffed mushrooms
[5/31/17, 8:48:47 AM] Brian Katz: $25
[5/31/17, 8:49:17 AM] Steve: Your getting close katz
[5/31/17, 8:50:38 AM] Steve: You're
[5/31/17, 8:50:41 AM] Steve: *
[5/31/17, 8:51:31 AM] Brian Katz: I didn't see what you guys ordered, but damn, you guys went ham on a Tuesday night
[5/31/17, 8:54:44 AM] Steve: Cheese went ham
[5/31/17, 8:54:52 AM] Steve: All I got was Hickey fingers and fried
[5/31/17, 8:54:56 AM] Steve: *fries
[5/31/17, 8:54:59 AM] Scott: they were terrible
[5/31/17, 8:55:01 AM] Scott: and costly
[5/31/17, 8:55:01 AM] Steve: It was also Monday night
[5/31/17, 8:55:04 AM] Scott: and never again.
[5/31/17, 8:55:08 AM] Steve: *chicken
[5/31/17, 8:55:11 AM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 8:55:13 AM] Scott: i twasn't monday
[5/31/17, 8:55:17 AM] Scott: i think it was sunday
[5/31/17, 8:55:18 AM] Scott: but dat cool
[5/31/17, 8:55:19 AM] Steve: Cheese mad
[5/31/17, 8:55:33 AM] Scott: u were too busy with your tongue down your new girlfriend's throat on monday
[5/31/17, 8:55:36 AM] Scott: #cheeseirishgoodbye
[5/31/17, 8:55:47 AM] Steve: Cheese is right, it took him 3 days to be reminded he didn't pay me
[5/31/17, 8:56:10 AM] Steve: I feel like you tried for a burn there, by then cheesed it
[5/31/17, 8:58:21 AM] Donk: Cheese going to send you a venmo request for payment instead of paying you
[5/31/17, 8:58:33 AM] Donk: The cheese double down
[5/31/17, 9:18:35 AM] Kiyoon: I think $25 is fair, tax and tip
[5/31/17, 9:20:35 AM] Scott: Or he could just tell me what I owe
[5/31/17, 9:20:40 AM] Scott: And I will pay it
[5/31/17, 9:25:06 AM] Steve: I'll take $25
[5/31/17, 9:39:54 AM] Kiyoon: Cheese it's not his responsibility when he spots you money
[5/31/17, 9:40:01 AM] Kiyoon: it's your responsibility to figure out what you owe him and pay him back
[5/31/17, 9:40:12 AM] Kiyoon: when you look at a menu and order you should probably have an idea of how much it costs
[5/31/17, 9:41:12 AM] Donk: Problem with that is cheese sees an appetizer, entree, dessert and a drink and it totals up in his head as "ill just buy steve 2 beers, thatll settle it"
[5/31/17, 9:41:36 AM] Kiyoon: I'd maybe give you a little slack if Steve ordered it and you just said, get me X and X, since Steve sees the price when he orders it
[5/31/17, 9:41:46 AM] Kiyoon: but you ordered it yourself, on Steve's phone for that matter
[5/31/17, 9:42:12 AM] Steve: No I ordered the food and told him how much each item was
[5/31/17, 9:42:33 AM] Steve: Then he came up with a number in his head including tax and top
[5/31/17, 9:42:33 AM] Steve: *tip
[5/31/17, 9:42:33 AM] Steve: Then forgot it
[5/31/17, 9:42:36 AM] Steve: And forgot to pay me
[5/31/17, 9:43:23 AM] Kiyoon: If you told him what he owed you then that's back on Cheese
[5/31/17, 9:43:33 AM] Steve: But the main point of this is to try and break cheese of his cheesy habits
[5/31/17, 9:43:46 AM] Steve: Because this isn't the first time he's done this, clearly
[5/31/17, 9:46:26 AM] Miller: the crazy thing is this is exactly why venmo was invented
[5/31/17, 9:46:40 AM] Miller: oh i owe you $X and i have my phone? this will take 3 seconds, done
[5/31/17, 9:47:05 AM] Steve: Cheese was "high and too busy texting his future wife"
[5/31/17, 9:47:27 AM] Miller: or hes playing the long game and earning interest on the float
[5/31/17, 9:48:02 AM] Steve: This is all just covfefe
[5/31/17, 9:49:53 AM] Miller: if every time he owes someone $25 he takes an extra month to pay it and instead invests that $ into an online savings account at 1% he will make an extra 2c, so if he does that 500x over his lifetime he can buy a beer, which he can use to repay another $25 debt
[5/31/17, 10:07:05 AM] Launchpad: The problem with deadbeat losers, is that if you ever want to get paid, you need to remove as much friction as possible from the interaction.  What you should have done was send him a collections notice in his name, but address it to his boss
[5/31/17, 10:07:29 AM] Steve: LP, please sit down.
[5/31/17, 10:07:52 AM] Launchpad: Im defending you jackass
[5/31/17, 10:08:08 AM] Launchpad: he only understands the language of the law
[5/31/17, 10:08:11 AM] Steve: I understand, but cheese isn't a dead beat.
[5/31/17, 10:08:19 AM] Steve: He's just cheese.
[5/31/17, 10:08:32 AM] Steve: Rich jones, dead beat.
[5/31/17, 10:08:38 AM] Donk: Now you are normalizing cheese
[5/31/17, 10:09:16 AM] Steve: You're right, but I also don't think he's a dead beat.
[5/31/17, 10:09:24 AM] Launchpad: Well I've seen his 'new group' credit report and am unimpressed.  Lets just say I'm going to require pre-payment before Cheese gets a key to the Bnb
[5/31/17, 10:10:11 AM] Miller: dont forget to include the deposit in there as well
[5/31/17, 10:11:01 AM] Miller: speaking of.......1 month away
[5/31/17, 10:11:28 AM] Steve: Thought I'd be more excited, meh.
[5/31/17, 10:12:16 AM] Miller: youre never excited about anything until we actually get there
[5/31/17, 10:12:42 AM] Steve: Also true
[5/31/17, 10:13:15 AM] Miller: you have 3 weeks until you have to tell us youre quitting drinking, make sure to put that on your calendar
[5/31/17, 10:13:40 AM] Steve: I've lost ten pounds so I'm doing better with the drinking
[5/31/17, 10:14:32 AM] Miller: now all you need is the vneck back
[5/31/17, 10:14:37 AM] Miller: and a shave
[5/31/17, 10:14:49 AM] Steve: Def need a shave
[5/31/17, 10:14:55 AM] Launchpad: Austin is too fucken great to not be excited for
[5/31/17, 10:15:10 AM] Launchpad: and you guys have an awesome BnB cause I stayed in that exact apartment already
[5/31/17, 10:15:25 AM] Steve: Did you have sex in that exact apartment?
[5/31/17, 10:15:54 AM] Miller: no this was pre-sex machine scott so were safe
[5/31/17, 10:15:59 AM] Launchpad: actually lol yes
[5/31/17, 10:16:03 AM] Launchpad: with my ex-gf
[5/31/17, 10:16:17 AM] Launchpad: I had relationship
[5/31/17, 10:16:26 AM] Launchpad: sex in that place
[5/31/17, 10:16:36 AM] Launchpad: which room though... üòÇ
[5/31/17, 10:16:52 AM] Steve: I'm sleeping on the couch
[5/31/17, 10:17:09 AM] Miller: i mean whatever, 8 billion people have probably banged in there in b/w that
[5/31/17, 10:17:12 AM] Miller: or in any hotel you stayed in
[5/31/17, 10:17:24 AM] Steve: But I know scott
[5/31/17, 10:17:29 AM] Justin: yeh but now you just gave LP some fuel
[5/31/17, 10:17:40 AM] Justin: gonna hold that over you all weekend
[5/31/17, 10:18:17 AM] Miller: gonna hold it over us that hes staying in the b-apt w/cheese who refused to pay him for it?
[5/31/17, 10:18:19 AM] Miller: ill survive
[5/31/17, 10:18:51 AM] Miller: @16195657200 you actually book a place yet?
[5/31/17, 10:19:46 AM] Launchpad: no lol
[5/31/17, 10:19:54 AM] Launchpad: going to do that tonight
[5/31/17, 10:19:58 AM] Miller: you 2 are gonna end up in a motel 6
[5/31/17, 10:20:35 AM] Launchpad: I hate you guys for doing this to me
[5/31/17, 10:21:03 AM] Miller: dont wait until the last minute next time?
[5/31/17, 10:21:23 AM] Launchpad: I bought my plane ticket months ago
[5/31/17, 10:21:27 AM] Launchpad: you booked the bnb without telling me
[5/31/17, 10:21:36 AM] Miller: i booked my airbnb in december
[5/31/17, 10:21:39 AM] Miller: i didnt tell anyone
[5/31/17, 10:22:15 AM] Miller: ppl hit me up and asked me to get them a place
[5/31/17, 10:22:19 AM] Steve: You actually told the entire group
[5/31/17, 10:22:32 AM] Steve: That you had booked a place and had spots available
[5/31/17, 10:22:37 AM] Steve: First come, first serve
[5/31/17, 10:22:44 AM] Miller: did i? i cant remember
[5/31/17, 10:22:46 AM] Steve: And LP was there
[5/31/17, 10:22:47 AM] Steve: Yes
[5/31/17, 10:22:53 AM] Miller: i thought pre-orders took up all the spots
[5/31/17, 10:22:57 AM] Steve: You've done pretty much the same thing every year
[5/31/17, 10:22:58 AM] Launchpad: I don't remember and if I did I would have wanted in
[5/31/17, 10:23:15 AM] Steve: Maybe, but Either way you texted the entire group about it
[5/31/17, 10:29:33 AM] Launchpad: lol
[5/31/17, 10:30:19 AM] Launchpad: I feel like I've asked months earlier and no one said anything
[5/31/17, 10:46:10 AM] Brian Katz: Meanest dunk ever
[5/31/17, 12:47:31 PM] Steve: http://nyp.st/2rC5bwl
[5/31/17, 12:47:37 PM] Steve: ^just saying guys
[5/31/17, 12:50:51 PM] Launchpad: this is some seriously revolutionary science
[5/31/17, 12:51:06 PM] Launchpad: Might even win a Nobel prize
[5/31/17, 12:51:41 PM] Steve: Clearly, it's a story from the NY Post. Most scientific of newspapers out there.
[5/31/17, 12:53:28 PM] Launchpad: Tim Ferris could really learn from their methodology
[5/31/17, 1:19:45 PM] Justin: surveyed 140 adults that 139 more than tim ferris experiment
[5/31/17, 1:20:36 PM] Launchpad: except you're wrong and you make shit up and you're fat and Ild rather take advice from an in shape Tim Ferris than a fat Herman
[5/31/17, 1:20:49 PM] Justin: ouch
[5/31/17, 1:21:23 PM] Justin: which part exactly did i make up?
[5/31/17, 1:21:47 PM] Launchpad: this part
[5/31/17, 1:22:01 PM] Justin: so he took blood work on how many people?
[5/31/17, 1:22:21 PM] Justin: becuase i know survey says 140 people
[5/31/17, 1:22:21 PM] Miller: so if tim ferriss got fat his advice would no longer be factual or relevant?
[5/31/17, 1:22:31 PM] Justin: that was next point
[5/31/17, 1:22:49 PM] Justin: but shhh miller
[5/31/17, 1:22:49 PM] Launchpad: correct
[5/31/17, 1:23:16 PM] Launchpad: http://tim.blog/2013/01/22/is-the-4-hour-body-a-scam-tracking-3500-people-to-find-out/
[5/31/17, 1:23:28 PM] Justin: interesting so a fat person with phd in nutrional science<  than tim ferris
[5/31/17, 1:23:44 PM] Launchpad: A fat person giving diet advice has no credibility
[5/31/17, 1:23:46 PM] Justin: here comes you dont have a phd
[5/31/17, 1:23:49 PM] Miller: the best pitching coach in MLB history has never pitched in a major league game
[5/31/17, 1:23:56 PM] Launchpad: its like me telling you how to become a billionaire
[5/31/17, 1:23:58 PM] Justin: thats fucken batshit crazy
[5/31/17, 1:24:41 PM] Justin: well consdiering thats exactly how tim ferris got rich, interesting catch 22
[5/31/17, 1:24:52 PM] Launchpad: actually its not
[5/31/17, 1:25:10 PM] Miller: circular reference
[5/31/17, 1:25:44 PM] Miller: 1. be poor
2. write book telling people how to be rich
3. get rich selling said book
4. retroactively makes your advice credible
[5/31/17, 1:25:46 PM] Sean: What if nutritionist with PHD has a medical issue
[5/31/17, 1:26:00 PM] Sean: That makes them fat?
[5/31/17, 1:26:39 PM] Launchpad: they'll have a hard time convincing & motivating people they know whats good for you
[5/31/17, 1:26:48 PM] Miller: is donald trump qualified to give people financial advice b/c hes rich?
[5/31/17, 1:26:48 PM] Launchpad: no one asked me for diet advice when I was fat
[5/31/17, 1:27:26 PM] Justin: and when you get fat again.....does it mean you no longer can give advise?
[5/31/17, 1:27:43 PM] Justin: advice*
[5/31/17, 1:27:50 PM] Launchpad: n 2001, Ferriss founded BrainQUICKEN, an online nutritional supplements company which made a product that was marketed as both BodyQuick and Brain Quicken.[16] It was claimed that this product would dramatically increase short term memory and reaction speed, taking effect within 60 minutes.[17] In 2010, he sold the company to a London-based private equity firm.[18] It was the experiences Ferriss had running BrainQUICKEN that led him to write The 4-Hour Workweek.[3]
[5/31/17, 1:28:38 PM] Justin: well according to quora... thats debatable
[5/31/17, 1:28:43 PM] Justin: https://www.quora.com/Did-Tim-Ferriss-only-get-rich-by-teaching-others-how-to-get-rich
[5/31/17, 1:28:47 PM] Launchpad: Ferriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek while working 14-hour days at BrainQUICKEN.[3][33]

The 4-Hour Workweek was rejected by 25 publishers.[34] In 2007, Random House, the 26th publisher, released the book through its Crown imprint.[35] Before release, Ferriss was an unknown.[36] He marketed the book heavily through bloggers with whom he created personal relationships.[36][36][37][38] The 4-Hour Workweek would reach No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and No. 1 on the BusinessWeek bestseller list.[39] It has currently sold over 1,350,000 copies and has spent nearly 4 years on the New York Times bestseller list.[4][5][40][41]

The book received both positive and negative reviews. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that, "With a punchy writing style and a higher literacy level than most flash-in-the-pan gurus, Ferriss has struck a chord with his critique of workers's slavish devotion to corporations... Ferriss' book skillfully compartmentalises, then pathologises, workers's unhealthy relationships with office life."[42] Dylan Tweney of Wired wrote, "Nearly every idea taken to extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck."[43]

In 2009, The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated was released by Random House and included multiple case studies authored by people who have utilized Ferriss's methods
[5/31/17, 1:28:51 PM] Justin: "Tim grew up rich, he had a supplement company, which he claims made good money, though others have disputed the reality of that based on comparable businesses. And really, you don‚Äôt know how much money he was making or how successful he was. He could say he was making 40k a month, he could have been making 20k a year."
[5/31/17, 1:29:05 PM] Sean: So you wouldn't go to a fat doctor?
[5/31/17, 1:29:43 PM] Launchpad: doctor maybe, but not a fat dietician or personal trainer
[5/31/17, 1:30:18 PM] Launchpad: also Robert Kiyosaki got rich from real estate first
[5/31/17, 1:30:37 PM] Justin: but there is plenty of misinformation and failed advice from skinny trainors?
[5/31/17, 1:30:41 PM] Launchpad: Yes there are people out there who write about getting rich and the only thing they do is write
[5/31/17, 1:31:04 PM] Justin: you are starting with a results oriented approach
[5/31/17, 1:31:24 PM] Justin: goal= skinny ... people that are skinny therefore know how to be skinny
[5/31/17, 1:31:29 PM] Justin: hahahaha
[5/31/17, 1:31:46 PM] Launchpad: its a credibility thing
[5/31/17, 1:31:52 PM] Justin: i woudlnt it leads to herniated discs
[5/31/17, 1:32:16 PM] Miller: who should you take advice from? him or 2010 vneck steve?
[5/31/17, 1:32:40 PM] Justin: what about this guy?
[5/31/17, 1:32:39 PM] Launchpad: Steve has no credibility either
[5/31/17, 1:32:43 PM] Miller: or phil to use a more relevant example
[5/31/17, 1:32:56 PM] Brian Katz: Nice socks
[5/31/17, 1:33:11 PM] Launchpad: I would let that guy train me
[5/31/17, 1:33:28 PM] Justin: well its same fat guy miller posted
[5/31/17, 1:33:49 PM] Launchpad: lol
[5/31/17, 1:34:23 PM] Justin: but that also leads to all kinds other considerations.  As in likelihood he juiced is probably in the upward of 90's in percentile
[5/31/17, 1:34:39 PM] Justin: so what works for him juicing might not work for other people with normal t levels
[5/31/17, 1:34:54 PM] Justin: miller got a future picture of me
[5/31/17, 1:35:11 PM] Justin: my titties are much bigger though
[5/31/17, 1:35:27 PM] Miller: any guesses who that is? pretty obvious tbh
[5/31/17, 1:35:54 PM] Launchpad: My point is you need to establish credibility.  Remember the uproar over Obamas obese surgeon general?
[5/31/17, 1:35:57 PM] Justin: i dont really know but im gonna guess arnold
[5/31/17, 1:36:00 PM] Brian Katz: I wouldn't let herman train me cause he's herman
[5/31/17, 1:36:12 PM] Miller: üéØ
[5/31/17, 1:36:13 PM] Launchpad: Lol
[5/31/17, 1:36:33 PM] Justin: can kinda see the get to the chopper chin
[5/31/17, 1:36:42 PM] Miller: yea i didnt cut it off quite good enough
[5/31/17, 1:36:52 PM] Sean: Would you let a fat guy coach your kids in sports?
[5/31/17, 1:37:00 PM] Justin: uh oh
[5/31/17, 1:37:05 PM] Justin: be careful lp
[5/31/17, 1:37:16 PM] Miller: would you let a slightly bigger guy serve you bbq food?
[5/31/17, 1:37:18 PM] Brian Katz: Sure
[5/31/17, 1:37:32 PM] Brian Katz: Unless it's Andy Reid
[5/31/17, 1:37:39 PM] Miller: evans baseball coach is overweight
[5/31/17, 1:37:42 PM] Miller: im fine w/it
[5/31/17, 1:37:48 PM] Brian Katz: Don't need to go straight to mediocrity
[5/31/17, 1:38:07 PM] Justin: evan has a baseball coach?
[5/31/17, 1:38:21 PM] Miller: ........its you
[5/31/17, 1:38:35 PM] Brian Katz: Justin can train him to be okay
[5/31/17, 1:38:37 PM] Justin: lol, was gonna say need to hire a new one...still holds true
[5/31/17, 1:38:53 PM] Miller: no way ill never find anyone who charges less
[5/31/17, 1:38:58 PM] Justin: although hes monster off the tee, throwing the ball forward part needs some work
[5/31/17, 1:39:52 PM] Brian Katz: Poor kid got that miller arm
[5/31/17, 1:40:08 PM] Miller: some things you cant escape
[5/31/17, 1:46:38 PM] Launchpad: absolutely
[5/31/17, 1:47:11 PM] Launchpad: obviously you guys are trolling.  This isn't rocket science.  Credibility is a thing
[5/31/17, 1:47:25 PM] Launchpad: I would not go to a dietician thats fatter than me
[5/31/17, 1:47:45 PM] Launchpad: I would let a fat coach teach my kid baseball
[5/31/17, 1:47:46 PM] Sean: Would you let a fat guy coach your kids in sports?
[5/31/17, 1:47:54 PM] Steve: I wouldn't
[5/31/17, 1:47:55 PM] Sean: In general sports
[5/31/17, 1:47:58 PM] Steve: Especially one named sean
[5/31/17, 1:48:04 PM] Steve: Hate that name
[5/31/17, 1:48:10 PM] Sean: üñïüèª
[5/31/17, 1:48:24 PM] Launchpad: yes cause its teaching the game, not being a hypocrit
[5/31/17, 1:48:37 PM] Launchpad: you wouldn't take financial advice from herman cause hes got no skin in the game
[5/31/17, 1:49:16 PM] Launchpad: you wouldn't take entrepreneurial advice from Herman either --- if you need advice....you talk to an actual entrepreneur
[5/31/17, 1:49:36 PM] Launchpad: you gotta talk the talk if you're going to walk the walk
[5/31/17, 1:50:10 PM] Launchpad: Hell I might lifting advice from Herman -- cause thats actually something he does
[5/31/17, 1:50:12 PM] Launchpad: just not diet advice no thank you
[5/31/17, 1:50:48 PM] Sean: Right but you don't know the circumstances of anyone's life to judge their knowledge on a subject based off of physical attributes
[5/31/17, 1:51:03 PM] Sean: Someone might be fat and not be able to help it and be the best nutritionist there is
[5/31/17, 1:51:33 PM] Launchpad: they might be -- but I don't like their commercial so I'm not buying their product
[5/31/17, 1:52:10 PM] Sean: So you rather go to a guy who is skinny with 0 knowledge just because he is skinny?
[5/31/17, 1:52:23 PM] Miller: theres no logical correlation b/w people being skinny and knowing anything about nutrition and vice versa
[5/31/17, 1:52:40 PM] Launchpad: I didn't say that either
[5/31/17, 1:52:58 PM] Miller: i could make the inverse argument that people who have been skinny their whole life or have naturally high metabolism might be less knowledgeable b/c they have never had the need to actually learn anything about dieting or nutrition
[5/31/17, 1:53:50 PM] Brian Katz: Moral of Scott's story, don't take advice from herman lol
[5/31/17, 1:53:56 PM] Launchpad: lol
[5/31/17, 1:54:06 PM] Launchpad: just on the dead lift
[5/31/17, 1:54:48 PM] Launchpad: I would take Kiyoons advice on where to find the best chickens
[5/31/17, 1:55:18 PM] Kiyoon: I def get where Scotty is coming from, there definitely is a stigma that a physical trainer or nutritionist should practice what they preach, however I wouldn't NOT take advice from a slightly obese trainer
[5/31/17, 1:55:20 PM] Launchpad: hes typing I just ruined his sentence üòÇ
[5/31/17, 1:55:27 PM] Kiyoon: you did
[5/31/17, 1:55:30 PM] Kiyoon: I am hoping you are trolling
[5/31/17, 1:55:56 PM] Kiyoon: I mean if people dot heir research and homework and get certified, that's good enough for me
[5/31/17, 1:56:03 PM] Launchpad: when am I not?
[5/31/17, 1:57:37 PM] Launchpad: Im not going to ask the guy picking cans in the ally what stock to buy -- thats just common sense
[5/31/17, 1:59:16 PM] Brian Katz: Gun to your head you had to have sex with one of them, rosanne Barr or Rosie O'Donnell, and why?
[5/31/17, 2:00:56 PM] Kiyoon: you can just pull the trigger
[5/31/17, 2:01:44 PM] Steve: I'd have sexual relations with Rosie
[5/31/17, 2:06:02 PM] Donk: Rosie, a league of their own kicks ass
[5/31/17, 2:06:24 PM] Donk: But either option sucks
[5/31/17, 2:06:26 PM] Launchpad: rosanne is crusty old and jaded
[5/31/17, 2:06:39 PM] Launchpad: but she did run for president
[5/31/17, 2:06:48 PM] Launchpad: ü§î
[5/31/17, 2:07:45 PM] Steve: Absolutely and I grew up on her talk show
[5/31/17, 2:08:20 PM] Sean: Ew I hate Rosie
[5/31/17, 2:09:52 PM] Steve: Yea we know
[5/31/17, 2:09:55 PM] Steve: And Beyonc√©

[5/31/17, 4:48:16 PM] Miller: sadly never seen southern charm
[5/31/17, 4:48:25 PM] Miller: its a big hole in my reality TV catalogue

[5/31/17, 4:51:48 PM] Launchpad: yeah
[5/31/17, 4:52:03 PM] Launchpad: just funny actually reading about a blood boy
[5/31/17, 4:58:35 PM] Miller: crazy he blew a 0.0

[5/31/17, 5:02:36 PM] Steve: He shouldn't have broken the law and been a celebrity
[5/31/17, 5:03:22 PM] Dan Watts: mmmm, pretty sure he'll walk on this
[5/31/17, 5:03:38 PM] Steve: I'm sure he won't do any time
[5/31/17, 5:03:43 PM] Kiyoon: dude was sleeping it off
[5/31/17, 5:03:48 PM] Steve: But his career/endorsements, done
[5/31/17, 5:03:50 PM] Miller: he wasnt sleeping it off
[5/31/17, 5:03:50 PM] Dan Watts: i don't even think he'll get a fine

[5/31/17, 5:04:05 PM] Steve: He hit something
[5/31/17, 5:04:07 PM] Miller: he had absolutely no idea where he was
[5/31/17, 5:04:23 PM] Donk: Hes not going to get banned from golf for this
[5/31/17, 5:04:32 PM] Donk: So he will still have his career
[5/31/17, 5:04:40 PM] Miller: except he sucks so he doesnt
[5/31/17, 5:04:40 PM] Donk: Whatever game he has left
[5/31/17, 5:04:42 PM] Steve: I'm not talking about a ban
[5/31/17, 5:04:44 PM] Dan Watts: he's going to say he took the meds he was prescribed
[5/31/17, 5:04:47 PM] Miller: this is gonna be ray rice 2.0
[5/31/17, 5:04:49 PM] Steve: I mean he's done as an athlete
[5/31/17, 5:05:00 PM] Donk: Secondly,  i higjly doubt nike will drop him over this
[5/31/17, 5:05:03 PM] Miller: now hes "blackballed" when in reality he just sucks too much
[5/31/17, 5:05:17 PM] Miller: he probably did
[5/31/17, 5:05:25 PM] Donk: He did alreadt say that
[5/31/17, 5:05:33 PM] Miller: im sure if you OD or mix the prescription shit they give you from back surgery you would look like that also
[5/31/17, 5:05:48 PM] Donk: Third,  hes worth lile 750mil, hell be fine
[5/31/17, 5:06:00 PM] Donk: 2nd best golfer ever
[5/31/17, 5:06:12 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:06:12 PM] Steve: Yes donk
[5/31/17, 5:06:14 PM] Miller: steepest decline in sports history
[5/31/17, 5:06:18 PM] Steve: Us saying his career and endorsements are done means his life is over
[5/31/17, 5:06:21 PM] Steve: He will just die
[5/31/17, 5:06:25 PM] Steve: Logical conclusion
[5/31/17, 5:06:40 PM] Donk: He will still get chances to play golf
[5/31/17, 5:06:44 PM] Dan Watts: in terms of publicity i think he can bounce back from this
[5/31/17, 5:06:54 PM] Donk: His carerr isnt any more over tham it was before this
[5/31/17, 5:06:54 PM] Steve: Roberto alomars was pretty steep also
[5/31/17, 5:07:02 PM] Donk: He didnt hurt anyone
[5/31/17, 5:07:05 PM] Steve: I'll agree to disagree
[5/31/17, 5:07:14 PM] Miller: what?!
[5/31/17, 5:07:14 PM] Dan Watts: if he can play at any decent level of golf this will be forgotten
[5/31/17, 5:07:21 PM] Miller: alomar was an all star for like 12 straight years
[5/31/17, 5:07:28 PM] Miller: and never the best player in the sport
[5/31/17, 5:07:32 PM] Launchpad: no one cares about DUI
[5/31/17, 5:07:33 PM] Steve: Roberto almost hit 332 the ear before the mets then was awful
[5/31/17, 5:07:35 PM] Miller: he had a pretty normal great career arc
[5/31/17, 5:07:51 PM] Steve: Like I'd rather have chuck knoblauch at second awful
[5/31/17, 5:07:53 PM] Miller: so by that logic then bartolo colon also
[5/31/17, 5:08:00 PM] Miller: bc he has a 7 ERA this yr
[5/31/17, 5:08:08 PM] Miller: tiger was still physically in his prime
[5/31/17, 5:08:08 PM] Steve: He's 45 lol
[5/31/17, 5:08:13 PM] Donk: Knoblach had a much steeper career decline than alomar
[5/31/17, 5:08:16 PM] Steve: Alomar was 31
[5/31/17, 5:08:17 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:08:19 PM] Steve: Yea
[5/31/17, 5:08:21 PM] Donk: One day he just couldnt throw to first
[5/31/17, 5:08:23 PM] Steve: Same thing Miller
[5/31/17, 5:08:24 PM] Miller: 34
[5/31/17, 5:08:26 PM] Miller: but sure
[5/31/17, 5:08:34 PM] Miller: wow 34 year old baseball player enters decline
[5/31/17, 5:08:36 PM] Steve: 34/45
[5/31/17, 5:08:37 PM] Miller: alert the press
[5/31/17, 5:08:37 PM] Steve: Same
[5/31/17, 5:08:41 PM] Steve: #millerlogic
[5/31/17, 5:08:44 PM] Miller: front page of spanish people
[5/31/17, 5:08:45 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:08:58 PM] Donk: Tiger hasnt been in his prime for like 9 years now
[5/31/17, 5:09:09 PM] Steve: Guy literally was one of the best second baseman in the game before the mets
[5/31/17, 5:09:11 PM] Donk: After he tore up his knee, it ruined his back
[5/31/17, 5:09:12 PM] Miller: who is the cover story next week? jason bay?
[5/31/17, 5:09:16 PM] Steve: Got to the mets, was horrendous
[5/31/17, 5:09:39 PM] Miller: no but he WAS in his prime when he fell off
[5/31/17, 5:09:56 PM] Miller: like if tomorrow clayton kershaw could no longer get anyone out
[5/31/17, 5:10:06 PM] Donk: True, but was due to injury.  Though tjat is how most players decline
[5/31/17, 5:10:16 PM] Donk: Its not like he just forgot how to play
[5/31/17, 5:10:26 PM] Miller: yea impossible to know how much is off field/wife vs injury
[5/31/17, 5:10:31 PM] Miller: id agree probably mostly the latter
[5/31/17, 5:10:34 PM] Miller: but the timing is suspect
[5/31/17, 5:10:38 PM] Miller: everything collapsed at once
[5/31/17, 5:10:44 PM] Donk: Also, he did come back after the injuries and wife thing to become #1 in the world again
[5/31/17, 5:10:52 PM] Donk: He just didnt win a major
[5/31/17, 5:10:58 PM] Donk: But won a bunch of tourneys
[5/31/17, 5:11:07 PM] Donk: But then the back went
[5/31/17, 5:11:13 PM] Donk: And its been over since then
[5/31/17, 5:12:14 PM] Steve: Downfall def began with wife/home issues
[5/31/17, 5:12:28 PM] Donk: I disagree
[5/31/17, 5:12:37 PM] Donk: It was the injuries
[5/31/17, 5:12:37 PM] Steve: Then injuries just never let him get back to normal
[5/31/17, 5:12:48 PM] Miller: btw robert almors terrible season w/the mets and his 710 OPS is still better than rougned odors this season so far or addison russel
[5/31/17, 5:12:51 PM] Launchpad: He'll always have Torrey Pines
[5/31/17, 5:12:56 PM] Donk: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:12:58 PM] Miller: when is the cover story on rougy odors fall from grace?
[5/31/17, 5:13:11 PM] Miller: punched joey bats in the face
[5/31/17, 5:13:13 PM] Miller: all down hill
[5/31/17, 5:13:27 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:13:38 PM] Steve: Keep trying to defend alomars crazy decline
[5/31/17, 5:13:44 PM] Steve: .336 year before
[5/31/17, 5:13:45 PM] Miller: the list of great baseball players who tailed off in the mid 30s has to be miles long
[5/31/17, 5:13:47 PM] Steve: All star
[5/31/17, 5:14:00 PM] Steve: Best second baseman or at least top 3
[5/31/17, 5:14:05 PM] Steve: Then sucked
[5/31/17, 5:15:59 PM] Launchpad: Geno Smiths fall from grace üëä üò´
[5/31/17, 5:16:17 PM] Miller: you think thats bad?
[5/31/17, 5:16:26 PM] Miller: what about the guy who went from batting 316 to 190
[5/31/17, 5:17:01 PM] Miller: or the other time when he went from batting 334 to 270
[5/31/17, 5:17:20 PM] Steve: Was he one of the best at his position ever?
[5/31/17, 5:17:29 PM] Miller: probably
[5/31/17, 5:17:35 PM] Steve: Because alomar was
[5/31/17, 5:17:50 PM] Steve: Well the 334 to 270 was jeter
[5/31/17, 5:17:56 PM] Steve: So I know that you don't think that
[5/31/17, 5:18:13 PM] Steve: And you don't believe he's even top 5 shortstop of all time
[5/31/17, 5:18:15 PM] Miller: and yet you missed when he went from 316 to 190 apparently
[5/31/17, 5:18:30 PM] Steve: Also, did jeter come back and hit 300 again?
[5/31/17, 5:19:09 PM] Miller: no? he hit 256 the yr after
[5/31/17, 5:19:12 PM] Miller: solid 600 OPS
[5/31/17, 5:19:18 PM] Miller: ridiculous drop off
[5/31/17, 5:19:20 PM] Miller: alert the press
[5/31/17, 5:19:41 PM] Miller: not like the manager was dumb enough to still bat him 2nd the entire season at least....
[5/31/17, 5:21:18 PM] Steve: And then?
[5/31/17, 5:21:33 PM] Miller: dont even get me started on texeira, 900 OPS to 650
[5/31/17, 5:21:43 PM] Steve: So jeter at 40 is same as alomar at 34
[5/31/17, 5:21:44 PM] Miller: is he next months cover?
[5/31/17, 5:21:49 PM] Steve: After an all star season
[5/31/17, 5:22:11 PM] Miller: jeters BA dropped 64 points at 35
[5/31/17, 5:22:19 PM] Miller: after leading the league in hitting
[5/31/17, 5:23:25 PM] Miller: how about at 33 when texs ops went from 800 to 600
[5/31/17, 5:23:55 PM] Miller: im literally just picking any random recently retired baseball players
[5/31/17, 5:24:25 PM] Miller: i actually have to finish some stuff but feel free to play this game at home on your own and you can stop thinking roberto alomars case is so unique or crazy
[5/31/17, 5:24:33 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:24:33 PM] Steve: #millerlogic
[5/31/17, 5:24:34 PM] Steve: How was jeter at 34-35?
[5/31/17, 5:24:52 PM] Steve: It is
[5/31/17, 5:25:27 PM] Steve: He was arguably the best second baseman ever
[5/31/17, 5:25:27 PM] Steve: Then he sucked
[5/31/17, 5:25:27 PM] Steve: But it's ok to still be bitter
[5/31/17, 5:25:27 PM] Steve: Things don't work out for mets fans
[5/31/17, 5:25:36 PM] Steve: Take a look at today's standings for proof
[5/31/17, 5:25:41 PM] Miller: well instead of using stevermetrics‚Ñ¢ he was awesome and then awful you could actually get some stats and prove your case
[5/31/17, 5:25:52 PM] Miller: or not
[5/31/17, 5:26:02 PM] Steve: I will
[5/31/17, 5:26:07 PM] Steve: When I'm not going to a soccer game
[5/31/17, 5:26:11 PM] Steve: But I'd gladly prove it
[5/31/17, 5:26:21 PM] Steve: To which you will probably pick another 40 year old
[5/31/17, 5:26:26 PM] Steve: Like you did with jeter
[5/31/17, 5:26:49 PM] Miller: i gave you jeters 35 year old season
[5/31/17, 5:26:50 PM] Miller: 2x
[5/31/17, 5:26:59 PM] Miller: and tex at 33
[5/31/17, 5:27:04 PM] Steve: In which he dipped 35 points?
[5/31/17, 5:27:09 PM] Miller: 65
[5/31/17, 5:27:13 PM] Steve: To alomars 100
[5/31/17, 5:27:45 PM] Steve: And was jeter the best short stop in baseball at age 34?
[5/31/17, 5:27:59 PM] Miller: 336-266 vs 334-270
[5/31/17, 5:27:59 PM] Miller: SO DIFFERENT
[5/31/17, 5:28:00 PM] Steve: Because alomar was most people's pick at second at age 33
[5/31/17, 5:28:02 PM] Miller: you are right
[5/31/17, 5:28:12 PM] Steve: The year before
[5/31/17, 5:28:40 PM] Miller: literally mirror image drop off
[5/31/17, 5:29:07 PM] Miller: but with alomar its the biggest decline in sports history, with jeter its such a down year
[5/31/17, 5:29:27 PM] Steve: I would say it's a much bigger drop considering he was who he was the year before
[5/31/17, 5:29:29 PM] Steve: Yes
[5/31/17, 5:29:40 PM] Steve: You may not think that but you have selective memory
[5/31/17, 5:29:55 PM] Steve: You don't remember the reaction when the mets picked him up?
[5/31/17, 5:30:06 PM] Steve: I'm sure it's the same reaction everyone gets at 33
[5/31/17, 5:30:15 PM] Steve: Joining a new team
[5/31/17, 5:30:15 PM] Miller: so 336 going to 266 is a much bigger drop off than 334 going to 270 b/c of who one guy is (not jeter) and who the other guy is (jeter)
[5/31/17, 5:30:23 PM] Steve: Nope
[5/31/17, 5:30:26 PM] Miller: just making sure were on the same page
[5/31/17, 5:30:36 PM] Steve: One guy was an all star and the best at his position the year before
[5/31/17, 5:30:49 PM] Miller: and jeter leading the AL in hitting was what?
[5/31/17, 5:30:52 PM] Steve: Hats he diffeeence
[5/31/17, 5:31:04 PM] Steve: So avg means something to you now?
[5/31/17, 5:31:05 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:31:07 PM] Steve: That's funny
[5/31/17, 5:31:14 PM] Miller: easy way to clear this up
[5/31/17, 5:31:21 PM] Steve: Thought for Miller "sabermetrics" Miller that means nothing
[5/31/17, 5:31:28 PM] Miller: jeter finished 3rd in MVP voting the year he hit 336
[5/31/17, 5:31:30 PM] Steve: But to prove your point, it's everything
[5/31/17, 5:31:31 PM] Miller: where do you think almoar finished?
[5/31/17, 5:31:55 PM] Miller: it was 4th
[5/31/17, 5:32:20 PM] Steve: Jeter went on to hit 300 3 more times in his career
[5/31/17, 5:32:21 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:32:24 PM] Miller: but keep spinning this jeter sucks now all of a sudden and was not the best at his position and alomar was the illegimate child of mike trout and honus wagner
[5/31/17, 5:32:24 PM] Steve: You left that out
[5/31/17, 5:32:34 PM] Steve: Doesn't fit your narrative
[5/31/17, 5:32:39 PM] Steve: Doesn't need to be mentioned
[5/31/17, 5:32:52 PM] Miller: like how you just say things and then ignore when they are proven wrong?
[5/31/17, 5:32:54 PM] Steve: Even batted 316 his age 39 season
[5/31/17, 5:33:00 PM] Steve: When did alomar return to form?
[5/31/17, 5:33:08 PM] Steve: You aren't proving anything
[5/31/17, 5:33:19 PM] Steve: I asked you a while ago, did jeter hit 300 again?
[5/31/17, 5:33:22 PM] Miller: sure, mvp voters know nothing
[5/31/17, 5:33:24 PM] Miller: steve knows everything
[5/31/17, 5:33:24 PM] Steve: You ignored and went on a rant
[5/31/17, 5:33:30 PM] Miller: jeter sucked
[5/31/17, 5:33:36 PM] Miller: alomar was a god
[5/31/17, 5:33:36 PM] Miller: i got it
[5/31/17, 5:33:38 PM] Miller: im good
[5/31/17, 5:33:40 PM] Miller: all clear
[5/31/17, 5:33:43 PM] Steve: Lol
[5/31/17, 5:33:49 PM] Steve: Typical Miller
[5/31/17, 5:33:57 PM] Steve: Yes, my point is I'm right always
[5/31/17, 5:33:57 PM] Launchpad: Jeter was the best at banging models and giving gift bags
[5/31/17, 5:34:02 PM] Steve: You got me
[5/31/17, 5:34:26 PM] Steve: Miller goes in circles then accuse everyone else of doing it
[5/31/17, 5:34:43 PM] Steve: Then ignores questions and tells people they are footing things
[5/31/17, 5:34:54 PM] Steve: *ignoring
[5/31/17, 5:52:19 PM] Sean: Yo they hate the gays in Spain now too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ
[5/31/17, 7:54:20 PM] Scott: Scott bitch schecter?
[5/31/17, 7:54:38 PM] Miller: Barry
[5/31/17, 8:05:53 PM] Launchpad: Easiest thing ever.  Spent about 60 seconds with the actual dr
[5/31/17, 8:06:39 PM] Scott: What did u tell doctor to get it
[5/31/17, 8:06:48 PM] Launchpad: Insomnia
[5/31/17, 8:08:00 PM] Scott: üò¥
[5/31/17, 8:09:32 PM] Miller: Crazy you're just getting this now
[5/31/17, 8:29:46 PM] Launchpad: Always had roommates with card or easy connect
[5/31/17, 8:30:21 PM] Launchpad: And i had a secret clearance so i avoided it just in case
[5/31/17, 8:30:41 PM] Launchpad: I was in and out in 15 min

[5/31/17, 10:14:44 PM] Miller: Serious eats is the shit
[5/31/17, 10:14:57 PM] Miller: My goto for all my home pizza tips
[5/31/17, 10:15:30 PM] Miller: And kenji Lopez chocolate chip cookie is the üêêcookie recipe
[5/31/17, 11:06:02 PM] Miller: @MichaelHofeld: If you are thinking of watching season 3 of Bloodline... don't. Quit while you're ahead. You've been warned.
[5/31/17, 11:06:08 PM] Miller: Great
[5/31/17, 11:10:34 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/1/17, 7:30:00 AM] Steve: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=emlsHiC3qZU
[6/1/17, 8:18:13 AM] Donk: He only has 4 fingers
[6/1/17, 8:18:50 AM] Donk: How does he flip the middle finger?
[6/1/17, 8:28:23 AM] Miller: Donk asking the real questions
[6/1/17, 10:15:48 AM] Scott: #arrogantdonk so arrogant that he has the ability to flip the middle finger at ppl
[6/1/17, 10:19:45 AM] Launchpad: he has an opposable thumb, in which there is still a middle finger, or he doesn't, and its the same one we use
[6/1/17, 10:20:14 AM] Scott: dude
[6/1/17, 10:20:15 AM] Scott: 4 figners
[6/1/17, 10:20:18 AM] Scott: fingers
[6/1/17, 10:20:24 AM] Scott: there is no single middle finger
[6/1/17, 10:20:39 AM] Scott: #lawyerlogic
[6/1/17, 10:28:23 AM] Miller: So according to launchpad since the thumb doesn't count as a finger technically we don't possess the ability to give someone the middle finger
[6/1/17, 10:28:36 AM] Justin: But by apposable .....thank you lol
[6/1/17, 10:28:46 AM] Justin: Literally almost new herman myself
[6/1/17, 10:29:16 AM] Justin: But perhaps even more  interesting point...we don't have middle fingers
[6/1/17, 10:29:26 AM] Justin: Some deep shit there
[6/1/17, 10:29:57 AM] Launchpad: I never said the thumb wasn't a finger though
[6/1/17, 10:30:10 AM] Miller: Look either we don't or Mr met doesn't, one of us cannot have a middle finger, you decide
[6/1/17, 10:30:29 AM] Scott: this is some fuckin covfefe
[6/1/17, 10:30:32 AM] Justin: Yeh I was on board with you for a moment. Now you being wishywashy
[6/1/17, 10:31:00 AM] Launchpad: yall need to stop doing this:
[6/1/17, 10:32:22 AM] Justin: So anyone binge house of cRds yet ?
[6/1/17, 10:32:26 AM] Launchpad: yesterday it goes from: I wont take diet advice from a fat person to 'you wouldn't let a fat guy coach your kids sports team'
[6/1/17, 10:32:35 AM] Steve: Not yet
[6/1/17, 10:32:37 AM] Donk: Im 9 episodes in lol
[6/1/17, 10:32:53 AM] Donk: But wont have a chance to finish it until this weekend
[6/1/17, 10:32:59 AM] Steve: I was about to say we all have jobs but then @19732079889
[6/1/17, 10:33:13 AM] Miller: Pro tip when someone puts one of these ? It means it's a question, not a conclusion
[6/1/17, 10:33:26 AM] Donk: Suffice to say, havent slept much so far this week
[6/1/17, 10:33:34 AM] Steve: That makes sense
[6/1/17, 10:33:45 AM] Steve: It's either you are off or you are staying up until 4 am
[6/1/17, 10:34:04 AM] Steve: Sunday is my day to do damage on that show
[6/1/17, 10:34:10 AM] Miller: Question, not a conclusion
[6/1/17, 10:34:11 AM] Steve: Hopefully get through half the season
[6/1/17, 10:34:32 AM] Miller: Question, not a conclusion
[6/1/17, 10:34:55 AM] Miller: Can you find me a jump to questions mat?
[6/1/17, 10:36:02 AM] Launchpad: i can invent one
[6/1/17, 1:50:44 PM] ‚ÄéMiller changed this group's icon
[6/1/17, 3:33:29 PM] Dan Watts: Trump pulling out of Paris deal? This guy is done
[6/1/17, 3:33:51 PM] Donk: Yeah its terrible
[6/1/17, 3:34:12 PM] Donk: I just dont understand people who dont believe in climate change
[6/1/17, 3:34:28 PM] Launchpad: Elon Musk said he would resign as an advisor if he does
[6/1/17, 3:36:00 PM] Dan Watts: i read that as well, hope he follows through
[6/1/17, 3:36:42 PM] Miller: http://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-store-employees-now-deliver-packages-to-customer-homes-2017-6 this seems fucking crazy to me
[6/1/17, 3:38:12 PM] Dan Watts: @15166335046 agreed
[6/1/17, 3:38:18 PM] Dan Watts: imposes such a cost on it's employees
[6/1/17, 3:38:28 PM] Launchpad: Funny I was just thinking about Walmart vs Amazon today
[6/1/17, 3:38:45 PM] Miller: like idk i get that it could seem like a win-win but just seems wrong
[6/1/17, 3:38:56 PM] Dan Watts: long day? now drop these groceries off on your way home
[6/1/17, 3:38:59 PM] Miller: lol
[6/1/17, 3:39:02 PM] Launchpad: with Amazon at $1000 -- how much more can they grow vs how much room is there for Walmart to take back market share
[6/1/17, 3:39:15 PM] Launchpad: because Walmart bought Jet.com
[6/1/17, 3:39:25 PM] Launchpad: interesting story behind that
[6/1/17, 3:40:12 PM] Miller: who cares what amzn stock price is
[6/1/17, 3:40:35 PM] Miller: if they did a 10/1 split would you prefer it at $100, would they then have more room to grow???
[6/1/17, 3:41:38 PM] Launchpad: asshole I meant their current market cap implied by $1000 share price
[6/1/17, 3:42:13 PM] Dan Watts: lol damn got him with his own shit
[6/1/17, 3:42:30 PM] Miller: sorry i didnt want to jump to a conclusion that you meant something you didnt say
[6/1/17, 3:42:44 PM] Launchpad: no thats just semantic trolling
[6/1/17, 3:43:34 PM] Miller: so dont take your words for what they imply and dont take your words for what you literally say
[6/1/17, 3:43:34 PM] Miller: got it
[6/1/17, 3:44:30 PM] Miller: i think from a 10000ft view you can logically ask yourself right now does everyone in the US use amazon to buy everything? if the answer there is no then there is probably room to grow
[6/1/17, 3:44:48 PM] Miller: whats their grocery market share? tenth of 1%?
[6/1/17, 3:44:54 PM] Miller: when are the drones coming?
[6/1/17, 3:45:24 PM] Launchpad: my question is who has more room - amazon or walmart
[6/1/17, 3:45:45 PM] Launchpad: and will jet end up taking significant business away from amazon
[6/1/17, 3:45:52 PM] Miller: certainly walmart has more room to grow in online b/c they have a much smaller share
[6/1/17, 3:46:09 PM] Miller: but thats somewhat meaningless b/c by definition every company not-amazon has more room to grow in e-commerce
[6/1/17, 3:46:42 PM] Launchpad: but they don't have a realistic pipeline like walmart does
[6/1/17, 3:47:16 PM] Launchpad: fuck off Im going to the dispensary
[6/1/17, 3:47:27 PM] Miller: can you explain in 1 or 2 sentences the thesis why someone would go to jet instead of amazon?
[6/1/17, 3:47:50 PM] Miller: are they going to offer free next day shipping? no minimums for free shipping?
[6/1/17, 3:47:58 PM] Miller: there needs to be a hook if they want to take share
[6/1/17, 3:48:08 PM] Launchpad: lower prices
[6/1/17, 3:48:41 PM] Miller: do they or are you saying they could?
[6/1/17, 3:49:12 PM] Miller: since 90% of the stuff on there is not sold by amazon (or jet) themselves why would 3rd party retailers underprice stuff at one vs the other?
[6/1/17, 3:49:12 PM] Launchpad: Ive never used it but I've heard that
[6/1/17, 3:49:21 PM] Miller: ive also never used it
[6/1/17, 3:49:29 PM] Miller: and im sure it does have some lower prices for stuff
[6/1/17, 3:49:39 PM] Launchpad: and I think walmart.com offers free shpping over $35 not positive
[6/1/17, 3:49:39 PM] Miller: just like walmart or staples or bestbuy does sporadicallty
[6/1/17, 3:49:49 PM] Miller: they do but thats the same as amazon i think
[6/1/17, 3:50:34 PM] Launchpad: ill brb
[6/1/17, 3:50:42 PM] Launchpad: I am serious about making my first dispensary trip
[6/1/17, 3:51:04 PM] Miller: go take your medicine and then come back with some walmart analysis
[6/1/17, 4:36:03 PM] Launchpad: my skype started blowing up and it got too late past lunch
[6/1/17, 4:36:11 PM] Launchpad: no medicine for me unless I get delivery

[6/1/17, 4:39:40 PM] Miller: damn the .01% of intersecting elon musk fans (or people who even know who he is) and trump voters will now surely turn on him
[6/1/17, 4:40:42 PM] Scott: lavar ball si the worst.
[6/1/17, 4:42:15 PM] Launchpad: Remember all those crybabies complaining how Elon Musk is corrupt, and 'one of them' when he joined the advisory council.  The idea of having a direct line to the president and enacting change was so foreign.  Clearly the only way to make a difference is to hold up signs while wearing birkenstocks in Prospect park üòÇ
[6/1/17, 4:42:57 PM] Steve: Scott, you say some dumb shit
[6/1/17, 4:43:06 PM] Steve: Maybe you should lay off the weed
[6/1/17, 4:43:09 PM] Miller: Scott's tbh
[6/1/17, 4:43:52 PM] Launchpad: you should smoke more weed so you stop arguing with everyone
[6/1/17, 4:43:57 PM] Steve: If protests don't do anything than how do explain how things have changed over history?
[6/1/17, 4:44:12 PM] Launchpad: Elon Musk
[6/1/17, 4:44:34 PM] Launchpad: has done more for alternative energy than any politician
[6/1/17, 4:44:43 PM] Launchpad: by making electric cars actually kind of cool
[6/1/17, 4:44:59 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/1/17, 4:45:00 PM] Steve: Says he guy who argues with everyone
[6/1/17, 4:45:00 PM] Steve: Don't see the irony in that?
[6/1/17, 4:45:09 PM] Steve: Probably not, because you are just saying dumb shit again.
[6/1/17, 4:45:23 PM] Launchpad: I only argue with you, Miller, herman, and occasionally donk
[6/1/17, 4:45:44 PM] Steve: Yes he has, but you end your "argument" with ridiculing protests
[6/1/17, 4:45:46 PM] Steve: Which in many instances have led to change as well
[6/1/17, 4:45:54 PM] Steve: That's 1/2 of the group
[6/1/17, 4:46:10 PM] Steve: And the other half just wonders if you really mean the stuff you say because it is that outrageous
[6/1/17, 4:46:27 PM] Launchpad: what Im saying is those were the people crying over Elon 'the traitor' going to work with Trump
[6/1/17, 4:47:11 PM] Steve: He didn't do anything at he White House
[6/1/17, 4:47:12 PM] Steve: What he should continue to focus on is developing new technology as he's always done
[6/1/17, 4:47:25 PM] Steve: Not try to convince a narcissistic ego maniac he's wrong
[6/1/17, 4:47:38 PM] Steve: That's a waste of his time
[6/1/17, 4:48:03 PM] Steve: He's never going to "get through to him" or "change his thinking"
[6/1/17, 4:48:39 PM] Launchpad: Wait....you mean hes not doing enough with Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, the Boring Company and his machine to brain interface company?
[6/1/17, 4:48:47 PM] Steve: Even people dumber than musk Knew that
[6/1/17, 4:48:48 PM] Steve: Sad things is that such a brilliant man couldn't until today
[6/1/17, 4:48:52 PM] Launchpad: Im sorry, you know what best for the billionaires
[6/1/17, 4:48:58 PM] Launchpad: and you say I say stupid things
[6/1/17, 4:49:00 PM] Steve: I didn't say hay he isn't
[6/1/17, 4:49:07 PM] Steve: You need to read more
[6/1/17, 4:49:14 PM] Steve: I said he should just focus on that
[6/1/17, 4:49:20 PM] Launchpad: what was the last book you read?
[6/1/17, 4:49:57 PM] Miller: and was it tim ferriss
[6/1/17, 4:50:21 PM] Steve: What does hat have to do with our current conversation?
[6/1/17, 4:50:21 PM] Steve: *that
[6/1/17, 4:50:24 PM] Steve: I read watts' dads book, a personal journey to positive change
[6/1/17, 4:50:38 PM] Launchpad: what year did you read that?
[6/1/17, 4:50:45 PM] Steve: Is that good enough for you or not intellectual enough to have an opinion on this?
[6/1/17, 4:50:45 PM] Launchpad: and which book before that?
[6/1/17, 4:50:49 PM] Steve: Last month
[6/1/17, 4:52:01 PM] Scott: üî•üî•üî•
[6/1/17, 4:52:03 PM] Launchpad: Im just curious if the guy who tells me I should read more actually reads books or just news sites and blogs
[6/1/17, 4:52:29 PM] Launchpad: cause we know he hasn't...
[6/1/17, 4:54:23 PM] Steve: I read a marathon book that Danielle had given me a while back and never opened
[6/1/17, 4:54:24 PM] Steve: Clearly reading doesn't mater because you still constantly say stupid shit
[6/1/17, 4:54:24 PM] Steve: But please, get to the point we all know you are headed towards
[6/1/17, 4:54:43 PM] Steve: I'm talking about my texts
[6/1/17, 4:54:47 PM] Steve: Not books
[6/1/17, 4:55:10 PM] Miller: reading about a marathon might be the only thing worse than doing a marathon
[6/1/17, 4:56:40 PM] Steve: It was the story of the runners of the NYC marathon back in 2005. They did exclusives in like 10 runners following them years before and their journeys to that point.
[6/1/17, 4:56:43 PM] Steve: It was actually incredibly inspirational
[6/1/17, 4:57:46 PM] Miller: not as inspirational as this
[6/1/17, 4:57:46 PM] Miller: Born at a very young age, Tim was adopted into a white, upper middle class suburban family who lived in St Paul, MN. As he grew up, he encountered various character building situations, such as a soccer career that persisted through college, and being heavily involved in a youth group that solidified his faith and decision to major in Youth Ministry at Northwestern College (St Paul, MN). Other adventures he happened upon included spending a fall at the Focus (on the Family) Leadership Institute, which in addition to equipping him to apply his faith holistically gave him a love for the outdoors. His first career position at Greenville College as a Resident Director allowed him gain a Master's in Student Affairs (Regent University), passionately invest in relationships, and also gave him several opportunities for backpacking, leading mission trips, and eating copious amounts of jello. He also found his spouse, Annie, who he married right before arriving at Messiah College the summer of 2011.
[6/1/17, 4:58:38 PM] Launchpad: Tim Ferrit?
[6/1/17, 4:59:04 PM] Launchpad: oozing with privilege
[6/1/17, 4:59:29 PM] Launchpad: Adopted by a white family? Game Over. May as well just give him a million bucks
[6/1/17, 4:59:40 PM] Steve: I fell asleep after the third sentence.
[6/1/17, 5:00:55 PM] Justin: So let me get this straight lp. Pulling out of Paris agreements in no way effects musk business?
[6/1/17, 5:01:04 PM] Justin: Please confirm this statement
[6/1/17, 5:02:32 PM] Launchpad: lol no
[6/1/17, 5:02:44 PM] Launchpad: confirm your own fucken statement
[6/1/17, 5:03:29 PM] Justin: Ok is it in musk self interest to promote Paris agreements?
[6/1/17, 5:03:28 PM] Launchpad: "Reading doesn't matter"  -- dumbest thing said all day
[6/1/17, 5:03:57 PM] Justin: Btw Tim ferris spent a summer at focus on the family retreat-now I officially hate him.
[6/1/17, 5:03:59 PM] Launchpad: is it a crime to align your own self interests with whats good for the planet?
[6/1/17, 5:04:04 PM] Justin: Legitamtely hate him now
[6/1/17, 5:04:21 PM] Miller: lololol
[6/1/17, 5:04:23 PM] Justin: No which is what he did by being in the council
[6/1/17, 5:04:26 PM] Miller: herman is turnt
[6/1/17, 5:04:38 PM] Justin: And his shows he has nothing to gain from being in the counsel
[6/1/17, 5:04:46 PM] Launchpad: Thats not Tim Ferris's bio thats Tim Ferrit
[6/1/17, 5:05:01 PM] Justin: So congratulations. He removed himself from being able to benefit from trump after trump told him to go fuck hinder
[6/1/17, 5:05:04 PM] Justin: Himself
[6/1/17, 5:05:11 PM] Justin: Wow courageous
[6/1/17, 5:05:44 PM] Justin: Moving. Gonna do a lot more society making selfish decisions and then after they fail pulling away from them because all that is left is bad press and no business opportunity
[6/1/17, 5:06:06 PM] Justin: Let's give him a trump participation trophy
[6/1/17, 5:06:07 PM] Miller: more or less courageous than apple removing the headphone jack?
[6/1/17, 5:06:13 PM] Justin: I'll print one up
[6/1/17, 5:06:23 PM] Miller: like you own a printer
[6/1/17, 5:06:28 PM] Launchpad: must be that hes a sleazy corrupt slimeball on trumps level
[6/1/17, 5:06:30 PM] Launchpad: how dare he try to change the world!!
[6/1/17, 5:06:31 PM] Launchpad: is it selfish if I breath?
[6/1/17, 5:06:36 PM] Launchpad: Because someone poorer than me could really use that air
[6/1/17, 5:06:38 PM] Justin: What?
[6/1/17, 5:06:59 PM] Justin: Why do you always create  strawman ?
[6/1/17, 5:07:12 PM] Justin: Musk joined trumps council to benefit himself
[6/1/17, 5:07:21 PM] Justin: He did so even against all the bad press and pressure not to
[6/1/17, 5:07:36 PM] Justin: Trump just threw all efforts to mandate subsidizing of clean energy it window
[6/1/17, 5:07:39 PM] Launchpad: Sharing Bernie Memes  >>>  Building electric cars
[6/1/17, 5:07:48 PM] Launchpad: Sharing Bernie Memes  >> Building solar panels
[6/1/17, 5:07:51 PM] Justin: Elon musk resigns now hat he has no interest to pursue left in trumps energy policy
[6/1/17, 5:07:54 PM] Justin: No strawman
[6/1/17, 5:07:56 PM] Justin: All facts
[6/1/17, 5:08:18 PM] Justin: But perhaps you should stop  breathing from the mouth so much
[6/1/17, 5:08:59 PM] Justin: Wtf which is it?
[6/1/17, 5:09:14 PM] Justin: Not that it matters, I think musk is  a genius.
[6/1/17, 5:09:25 PM] Launchpad: Fact: Elon Musk resigns
Opinion: he has no interest to pursue left in trumps energy policy
[6/1/17, 5:09:26 PM] Launchpad: not all facts...a mix of facts and opinions
[6/1/17, 5:09:35 PM] Justin: But building electric panels makes him filthy rich as wel
[6/1/17, 5:09:40 PM] Justin: So there is that.
[6/1/17, 5:10:04 PM] Justin: Does Paris agreement mandate a lowering of fossil fuel emissions?
[6/1/17, 5:11:16 PM] Justin: If you mean I can't predict the future surely that is right. I.e you can't "prove" building electric cars had had any more effect than sharing a Bernie meme
[6/1/17, 5:11:46 PM] Justin: But you don't see me stupidly attacking that as an assumption because it's a logical prediction.
[6/1/17, 5:13:43 PM] Steve: The agreement doesn't mandate anything
[6/1/17, 5:13:58 PM] Justin: It sets a goal
[6/1/17, 5:14:16 PM] Justin: Has some carbon tax and some regulatory functions.
[6/1/17, 5:14:30 PM] Launchpad: We do know this: Bernie voters can't afford Teslas
[6/1/17, 5:14:45 PM] Justin: Bernie can
[6/1/17, 5:14:52 PM] Justin: üôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[6/1/17, 5:14:55 PM] Steve: Yea but that's up to the country to decide whether they want to implement
[6/1/17, 5:15:22 PM] Miller: herm throwing up the dez?
[6/1/17, 5:15:58 PM] Steve: He must have read how dez feels like it's 2014 again
[6/1/17, 5:16:03 PM] Steve: For any of you with short memory, it's when he exploded for 18 touchdowns
[6/1/17, 5:16:05 PM] Launchpad: The Boring company is seeking to reduce greenhouse gases emitted by excessive traffic
[6/1/17, 5:16:25 PM] Scott: R u the president of the boring company
[6/1/17, 5:16:54 PM] Launchpad: also a member
[6/1/17, 5:17:23 PM] Launchpad: SpaceX is going to save the human race by colonizing Mars after Trump destroys the planet
[6/1/17, 5:17:44 PM] Justin: Lol
[6/1/17, 5:18:05 PM] Launchpad: thats what I was going for
[6/1/17, 5:18:12 PM] Miller: you mean spaceüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇ
[6/1/17, 5:18:51 PM] Justin: Look musk is doing a great thing. He's doing it while making a shit ton of money. But he is forging the way forward to reduce the costs of the technology.  Once again not gonna criticize what he is doing
[6/1/17, 5:19:20 PM] Justin: Just saying no shit he left trumps team -there was no carrot and onlything  left was turning bad press to good press
[6/1/17, 5:19:19 PM] Steve: No one has criticized what he's doing professionally
[6/1/17, 5:19:24 PM] Steve: It's literally impossible
[6/1/17, 5:19:37 PM] Steve: But joining some made up trump council?! Waste of fucking time
[6/1/17, 5:19:53 PM] Steve: He's not listening to anyone not named bannon or kushner
[6/1/17, 5:19:57 PM] Justin: Well he found that out obviously
[6/1/17, 5:20:18 PM] Justin: Could argue wasn't much opp cost other than bad press, which before whole Russia thing was mounting
[6/1/17, 5:20:27 PM] Steve: Shocking people outside who are clearly not as intelligent told him it was exactly that
[6/1/17, 5:20:37 PM] Justin: Now all anyone ever talks about is putin
[6/1/17, 5:20:37 PM] Steve: Yet he believed in trump, blindly
[6/1/17, 5:21:00 PM] Justin: Yeh but I mean he receives billions is subsidiy from federal government
[6/1/17, 5:21:23 PM] Justin: Not exactly like he had much choice but to feel it out and hope he could convince trump
[6/1/17, 5:21:30 PM] Miller: or trump for that matter
[6/1/17, 5:21:41 PM] Steve: ^#truth
[6/1/17, 5:22:00 PM] Justin: I'm on board, just think he's an extremely intelligent guy and weighted his options before he did it
[6/1/17, 5:22:16 PM] Justin: Clearly we can play Monday morning qb and say I told you so
[6/1/17, 5:22:22 PM] Steve: I'm not saying he didn't and he isn't
[6/1/17, 5:22:28 PM] Steve: Clearly it was a waste of time
[6/1/17, 5:22:33 PM] Miller: if hes so intelligent how come he doesnt have metal legs yet?
[6/1/17, 5:22:33 PM] Steve: And many told him so
[6/1/17, 5:22:37 PM] Justin: But yeh I mean it was
[6/1/17, 5:22:40 PM] Steve: Yet he did it anyway
[6/1/17, 5:23:14 PM] Steve: Have you ever felt up on musks legs?
[6/1/17, 5:23:20 PM] Steve: How do you know he doesn't?
[6/1/17, 5:23:48 PM] Justin: Mind blown.  Maybe he's skynet?
[6/1/17, 5:23:57 PM] Steve: Miller now feverishly searching he internet for musk in shorts pics
[6/1/17, 5:31:20 PM] Miller: its catching on
[6/1/17, 5:34:08 PM] Justin: In all this what really got lost was Tim ferris connection to focus on family. I will not live that down.
[6/1/17, 5:34:23 PM] Justin: Mind altering moment.
[6/1/17, 5:35:49 PM] Justin: Literally was the driving force behind making poker illegal. A group of Religious fundamentalist nut job conservative scum.
[6/1/17, 5:37:35 PM] Launchpad: Confirmation bias anyone???
[6/1/17, 5:38:16 PM] Launchpad: http://www.messiah.edu/info/21483/staff/2254/tim_ferret
[6/1/17, 5:38:48 PM] Launchpad: keep going though this is funny
[6/1/17, 5:39:53 PM] Justin: Lol.
[6/1/17, 5:39:59 PM] Justin: Ok he's saved.
[6/1/17, 5:40:04 PM] Justin: I hate Tim ferrit
[6/1/17, 5:41:42 PM] Miller: blasphemy
[6/1/17, 5:43:49 PM] Launchpad: troll of the day
[6/1/17, 5:46:37 PM] Justin: Miller got me bad. I will now no longer associate tim ferris with Tim ferrit
[6/1/17, 5:46:45 PM] Justin: Fuck Tim ferrit
[6/1/17, 5:52:49 PM] Miller: 2nd time, I originally got katz to think that guy pictured above was actually Tim ferris
[6/1/17, 5:53:53 PM] Launchpad: he does look like he works out
[6/1/17, 5:54:12 PM] Miller: U mirin?
[6/1/17, 5:56:57 PM] Launchpad: just wondering how he got those pecs
[6/1/17, 5:58:06 PM] Brian Katz: Guy looks like he got hit with a flash bang grenade
[6/1/17, 7:18:10 PM] Launchpad: 5 grams of alpha blue is on its way ü§óü§óü§ó
[6/1/17, 7:18:27 PM] Launchpad: plus the new member gift - 1g of J1
[6/1/17, 7:18:45 PM] Launchpad: I could get used to this...
[6/1/17, 7:19:03 PM] Steve: Do they deliver?
[6/1/17, 7:19:08 PM] Launchpad: yeah
[6/1/17, 7:19:17 PM] Steve: So you have a new dealer
[6/1/17, 7:19:21 PM] Steve: Congrats?
[6/1/17, 7:19:24 PM] Launchpad: basically
[6/1/17, 7:19:51 PM] Launchpad: I think most of them do delivery cause a few years ago the city shut down many of the physical stores
[6/1/17, 8:00:28 PM] Miller: Started randomly watching the office (started at season 3), I forgot how great this show was
[6/1/17, 8:00:40 PM] Miller: It's weird they don't have reruns on TV ever
[6/1/17, 8:14:56 PM] Steve: Felt that way about parks and rec
[6/1/17, 8:15:16 PM] Steve: Rewatched the entire show a month ago
[6/1/17, 8:15:55 PM] Miller: I liked p&r for the first time recently, it was good but re-watching office makes me think it wasn't in the same ballpark
[6/1/17, 8:16:10 PM] Miller: I think the late seasons of office had ruined my memories
[6/1/17, 8:18:14 PM] Kiyoon: It's so good
[6/1/17, 8:18:20 PM] Kiyoon: Go back to season 1 and rewatch
[6/1/17, 8:18:24 PM] Kiyoon: Done that 5 times now
[6/1/17, 8:18:47 PM] Kiyoon: Normally skip the seasons without Micheal and fast forward to the last season
[6/1/17, 8:19:06 PM] Miller: Yea big drop off when he left
[6/1/17, 8:19:24 PM] Steve: I want to rewatch the office because I fee like it will be like parks and rec, better this time around.
[6/1/17, 8:19:37 PM] Steve: But I have OITNB and house of cards first
[6/1/17, 8:20:06 PM] Miller: Yea this is my background tv or shit I can watch without Nicole
[6/1/17, 8:20:10 PM] Miller: And 20 minutes each
[6/1/17, 8:20:32 PM] Steve: Did nicole get into OITNB?
[6/1/17, 8:20:44 PM] Miller: Yea we're caught up
[6/1/17, 8:20:51 PM] Miller: Not counting the leaked season
[6/1/17, 8:21:02 PM] Steve: Piper got better this season
[6/1/17, 8:21:05 PM] Steve: More bearable
[6/1/17, 8:21:13 PM] Steve: Well last season
[6/1/17, 8:21:18 PM] Steve: This season hasn't come out yet
[6/1/17, 8:21:18 PM] Miller: She's fine as long as they don't focus on her
[6/1/17, 8:21:25 PM] Miller: Hackers leaked it
[6/1/17, 8:21:28 PM] Miller: I have it
[6/1/17, 8:21:34 PM] Steve: Yea, but I'm avoiding it
[6/1/17, 8:21:54 PM] Launchpad: Completely agree -- she needed to be humbled
[6/1/17, 8:22:01 PM] Launchpad: season 4 was much better than season 3
[6/1/17, 8:22:02 PM] Miller: I just haven't gotten around to it, not sure when it officially comes out
[6/1/17, 8:22:10 PM] Steve: That and she was just really annoying
[6/1/17, 8:22:19 PM] Launchpad: and apparently the first 10 episodes leaked already and they are awesome
[6/1/17, 8:22:22 PM] Miller: Yea season 3 was pretty bad
[6/1/17, 8:22:48 PM] Steve: Hats to Scotty
[6/1/17, 8:22:52 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/1/17, 8:22:54 PM] Miller: üé©
[6/1/17, 8:23:40 PM] Steve: You're right Kiyoon, the new Scotty does feel like I'm calling him a dumbass
[6/1/17, 8:23:48 PM] Steve: Again, my apologies for misusing it
[6/1/17, 8:25:13 PM] Launchpad: This has been discussed before -- we need a new rule for the 'less than 1 minute late'
[6/1/17, 8:25:21 PM] Kiyoon: Lolz
[6/1/17, 8:25:25 PM] Steve: I disagree
[6/1/17, 8:25:34 PM] Steve: You should be able to scroll up 5 texts ago
[6/1/17, 8:25:42 PM] Steve: It's the 2 hours late hat should be exempt
[6/1/17, 8:26:24 PM] Miller: The 2 hour late üé©
[6/1/17, 8:26:39 PM] Launchpad: got it
[6/1/17, 8:27:17 PM] Launchpad: Old news is where New Herman originated from
[6/1/17, 8:27:33 PM] Launchpad: New launchpad isn't really a thing, Miller just made that pic
[6/1/17, 8:28:15 PM] Miller: I was asked to stop making fun of Herman so I had no pick my 2nd favorite picture on my phone
[6/1/17, 8:28:46 PM] Miller: You act like new Herman originated from the old testament and has been passed down from generation to generation
[6/1/17, 8:29:28 PM] Launchpad: it originated in the old testament of 'group' chat
[6/1/17, 8:40:56 PM] Miller: Good album, you should go
[6/1/17, 9:16:41 PM] Kiyoon: So amazing how LeBron travems
[6/1/17, 9:16:44 PM] Kiyoon: Travels
[6/1/17, 9:17:04 PM] Steve: They all do
[6/1/17, 11:07:46 PM] Miller: Found the answer https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=784931575012861&id=363765800431935

[6/2/17, 12:11:33 PM] Miller: they were making fun of michael scott on the office for not knowing ben franklin wasnt a president but im not sure i ever realized he wasnt a president either, granted im a complete moron on anything related to history or geography but i tend to think of myself as more intelligent than michael scott, idk if this is super common knowledge or what
[6/2/17, 12:11:46 PM] Miller: dudes on money, is he the only non-president on currency?
[6/2/17, 12:12:31 PM] Steve: Is Ulysses a grant on money anymore?
[6/2/17, 12:12:48 PM] Steve: He was also not a president
[6/2/17, 12:13:04 PM] Steve: Oh wait

[6/2/17, 12:13:19 PM] Steve: Guess we are in the same boat if not knowing presidents
[6/2/17, 12:13:19 PM] Donk: On the 10, not a president
[6/2/17, 12:13:31 PM] Miller: damn they just put anyone on $
[6/2/17, 12:14:00 PM] Donk: Grant was a president, but not on a bill
[6/2/17, 12:14:05 PM] Miller: good enough to be immortalized on currency, not good enough to be president
[6/2/17, 12:14:22 PM] Steve: He is on the 50 no?
[6/2/17, 12:14:28 PM] Steve: Or was on the 50
[6/2/17, 12:14:42 PM] Steve: I'm like 98 percent sure he was at least on the 50 at some point
[6/2/17, 12:14:52 PM] Steve: Thought he was just a general
[6/2/17, 12:14:54 PM] Donk: Oh wait
[6/2/17, 12:14:55 PM] Miller: ive probably had < $50 bills in my entire life
[6/2/17, 12:14:59 PM] Miller: i cant think of a more useless bill
[6/2/17, 12:15:02 PM] Donk: He is on the 50 haha
[6/2/17, 12:15:04 PM] Miller: < 5
[6/2/17, 12:15:10 PM] Steve: Boom
[6/2/17, 12:15:13 PM] Steve: So you know presidents

[6/2/17, 12:17:20 PM] Donk: Id vote to ditch the penny and round up or down
[6/2/17, 12:17:21 PM] Steve: And apparently some guy names Salman chase was on the first us currency ever
[6/2/17, 12:17:41 PM] Miller: i hate all coins

[6/2/17, 12:17:44 PM] Steve: Those are the only non presidents
[6/2/17, 12:17:54 PM] Steve: Learn something new everyday
[6/2/17, 12:18:07 PM] Miller: this isnt 1950 when a soda and slice of pizza is a nickel
[6/2/17, 12:18:11 PM] Miller: get the fuck outta here nickels
[6/2/17, 12:18:14 PM] Miller: youre useless
[6/2/17, 12:18:28 PM] Steve: Quarters are only reputable and useful coin
[6/2/17, 12:18:32 PM] Steve: Because of meters
[6/2/17, 12:18:41 PM] Steve: *usable
[6/2/17, 12:20:16 PM] Miller: one of the few benefits of having a kid i give evan all my change for his "money pig" and hes always super excited about it (almost as excited as i am to be getting rid of it)
[6/2/17, 12:20:35 PM] Steve: Kids gonna be loaded
[6/2/17, 12:20:46 PM] Miller: not really i use my card for like 95% of purchases
[6/2/17, 12:20:48 PM] Steve: Wall around class buying women soda pops
[6/2/17, 12:20:51 PM] Steve: *walk
[6/2/17, 12:21:03 PM] Miller: i wake up this morning and hes in our bed and i roll over and hes awake and staring at me and goes "its me!"
[6/2/17, 12:21:12 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/2/17, 12:21:20 PM] Steve: That kid is awesome
[6/2/17, 12:21:33 PM] Steve: Gotta get him to troll you eventually
[6/2/17, 12:21:38 PM] Steve: Baby steps
[6/2/17, 12:21:54 PM] Miller: im not totally sure he already isnt sometimes
[6/2/17, 12:29:34 PM] Steve: Well, he learned from the best. And Ryan isn't too far behind.
[6/2/17, 12:31:22 PM] Donk: Chase bank was named after salmon chase i just learned
[6/2/17, 12:31:38 PM] Steve: He was like the first head of treasury?
[6/2/17, 12:31:48 PM] Steve: I didn't go to into his bio
[6/2/17, 12:31:56 PM] Steve: Or secretary of treasury?
[6/2/17, 12:32:03 PM] Steve: *too
[6/2/17, 12:32:13 PM] Donk: 25th sec of treasury
[6/2/17, 12:32:25 PM] Steve: Damn, we had 25 before him?
[6/2/17, 12:32:33 PM] Steve: Shiiiiit
[6/2/17, 12:32:36 PM] Donk: But also the 6th chief justice
[6/2/17, 12:33:01 PM] Donk: Hamilton was the 1st sec treasury
[6/2/17, 12:33:10 PM] Steve: That makes sense
[6/2/17, 12:33:33 PM] Launchpad: Sack-a-jew-ee-a wasn't a president either
[6/2/17, 12:33:48 PM] Steve: But he's no longer on currency
[6/2/17, 12:33:52 PM] Steve: I don't think at least
[6/2/17, 12:33:57 PM] Launchpad: She?
[6/2/17, 12:34:05 PM] Steve: Like chase
[6/2/17, 12:34:51 PM] Steve: *she

[6/2/17, 12:41:53 PM] Steve: We already have that
[6/2/17, 12:42:05 PM] Steve: Literally the lunch they serve at my works cafeteria
[6/2/17, 12:43:17 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0IucRz-FzM
[6/2/17, 12:48:30 PM] Justin: Was eating lunch with Joia and somehow we ended up st btp wiki page.
[6/2/17, 12:49:09 PM] Steve: It was a good 17 years
[6/2/17, 12:49:20 PM] Steve: And disbanded sounds much worse
[6/2/17, 12:49:53 PM] Miller: 2008 - cheese becomes president
[6/2/17, 12:49:58 PM] Miller: coincidence?
[6/2/17, 12:50:01 PM] Justin: Yeh what dick updated this wiki with all these shitty reasons
[6/2/17, 12:50:13 PM] Miller: that is basically the reason
[6/2/17, 12:50:34 PM] Miller: pretty sure you had 4 pledges cumulatively in the 2 yrs after i left
[6/2/17, 12:51:03 PM] Steve: We had the petty pledge class which stated off as 6
[6/2/17, 12:51:10 PM] Miller: i was there for that
[6/2/17, 12:51:13 PM] Steve: The cheese pledge class which was 5?
[6/2/17, 12:51:17 PM] Miller: that was 06
[6/2/17, 12:51:22 PM] Steve: Damn we are old
[6/2/17, 12:51:25 PM] Miller: or fall 05
[6/2/17, 12:52:17 PM] Miller: i think i was actually pledgemaster for those clowns
[6/2/17, 12:54:16 PM] Launchpad: Chief is living proof the Butterfly Effect is real
[6/2/17, 12:57:45 PM] Scott: lol
[6/2/17, 12:58:33 PM] Launchpad: theres an old Groucho Marx quote "I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member"
[6/2/17, 12:58:45 PM] Launchpad: updated for the modern times, it would go something like this:
[6/2/17, 12:58:54 PM] Launchpad: "I don't care to belong to any club that will have Chief as a member"
[6/2/17, 1:02:32 PM] Miller: did you neg him?
[6/2/17, 1:03:27 PM] Launchpad: everyday
[6/2/17, 1:03:34 PM] Launchpad: it worked, he didn't go away
[6/2/17, 1:05:21 PM] Miller: wat
[6/2/17, 1:05:41 PM] Donk: Lp was trying to bang chief?
[6/2/17, 1:07:59 PM] Miller: chief as annoying as he was at times (okay almost all the times) was still one of the only people who you could ever count on to ever do anything to help out
[6/2/17, 1:08:24 PM] Miller: also respect the shit out of him for getting through pledging by himself, that shit is no joke
[6/2/17, 1:08:27 PM] Launchpad: we just didn't know what negging was at the time
[6/2/17, 1:08:37 PM] Launchpad: Thank you Mystery, for this technology
[6/2/17, 1:09:03 PM] Launchpad: we lost Randy cause of Chief
[6/2/17, 1:09:21 PM] Miller: no we lost randy b/c he stopped taking his meds and went insane
[6/2/17, 1:09:57 PM] Miller: you would think somewhere b/w louis and w/e his name was who pledged after i left and went insane we would start checking kids for mental illness? apparently not
[6/2/17, 1:11:57 PM] Donk: Yeah,  chief wasnt the worst
[6/2/17, 1:12:04 PM] Donk: That was grouper
[6/2/17, 1:12:27 PM] Miller: how could i forget doogie in our lets recruit kids with mental illness
[6/2/17, 1:12:35 PM] Miller: weird we closed down
[6/2/17, 1:12:47 PM] Miller: stop flyering for rush at the psych wards maybe? naaaa
[6/2/17, 1:13:13 PM] Miller: im not sure grouper had 1 redeeming quality
[6/2/17, 1:15:01 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/2/17, 1:15:47 PM] Launchpad: The 'end of retail' brought about by competition from Amazon has scared many investors away from even the strongest retailers.

Wal-Mart (WMT) is still the strongest retailer in the world, with over $485 billion in annual sales (more than 3x Amazon's sales for comparison).  And, Wal-Mart is profitable by any measure, generating more than $13 billion in net income on its tremendous sales base over the trailing twelve months.

Yes, the retail landscape is changing.  Customers are making more online purchases than ever.  Wal-Mart saw this years ago, and has taken the steps to compete in an increasingly 'omni-channel' (online/offline) retail environment.

These changes are starting to pay off. 

This morning, Wal-Mart announced its US operations returned to positive operating income growth (a modest 0.9% increase) versus the same quarter a year ago for the first time in 3 years.  Wal-Mart is growing again, in the US.

Comparable store sales increased increased 1.4% in the US.  The company is expecting continued comparable store sales growth of 1.5% to 2.0% next quarter, versus the same quarter a year ago.

E-commerce growth is driving comparable store sales growth at Wal-Mart.  The company saw e-commerce GMV (gross merchandise value) grow an incredible 69% versus the same quarter a year ago.  The company's management clarified that most of this growth is organic, and not the result of acquisitions.

Moving to free shipping on orders over $35 and discounts for in-store pickup of online orders helped drive the impressive growth.  These numbers are more impressive considering that Wal-Mart is already the 2nd largest retailer in the United States (behind only Amazon).

All told, Wal-Mart grew earnings-per-share a modest 2% versus the same quarter a year ago. 

More importantly, the company's growth strategy is beginning to pay off .  The company's stock was up 2.5% at the time of this writing due to positive quarterly results.
[6/2/17, 1:16:23 PM] Justin: Well not reading that. But as miller mocked amazon food delivery yesterday
[6/2/17, 1:16:55 PM] Dan Watts: Agreed. Dumb as a brick, didn't bring girls, didn't pay dues, not funny, not cool
[6/2/17, 1:16:56 PM] Launchpad: ive ordered amazon food delivery before
[6/2/17, 1:17:23 PM] Miller: i wasnt mocking at all, you misread that
[6/2/17, 1:17:28 PM] Miller: was listing it as an opportunity
[6/2/17, 1:17:44 PM] Miller: like have no share right now, and in 10yrs probably will be the goto for online grocery delivery
[6/2/17, 1:17:50 PM] Launchpad: I did clock him in the head
[6/2/17, 1:17:56 PM] Miller: amazon is drago, everything they hit they destroy
[6/2/17, 1:18:02 PM] Justin: Oh I thought you meant it like "what are they gonna do expand grocery delivery "
[6/2/17, 1:18:19 PM] Miller: oh no they absolutely are, just recently rolled out the prime grocery program
[6/2/17, 1:18:37 PM] Miller: went to the grocery store this past weekend and was such a miserable experience, im gonna sign up for this amazon shit and give it a tryt
[6/2/17, 1:18:46 PM] Miller: can get same-day delivery pretty solid
[6/2/17, 1:20:20 PM] Miller: The 'end of rentals' brought about by competition from Netflix and VOD has scared many investors away from investing in Blockbuster.

Blockbuster (BB) is still the strongest video rental store in the world, with over $4 billion in annual sales (more than 30x Netflix sales for comparison)
[6/2/17, 1:22:07 PM] Justin: Lol
[6/2/17, 1:22:40 PM] Justin: So while you wrote these past 4 messages I was looking for this Facebook post I saw earlier
[6/2/17, 1:25:15 PM] Miller: btw from someone much smarter than any of us opinion (and FWIW this guy is pretty negatively biased against trump generally) he said pulling out of the paris thing is being completely overblown, was no mandate or enforcement in there and non-binding and plus this is something he said he was going to do on the campaign trail so not sure why its surprising, optically only negative is doesnt look great to be one of 3 countries pulling out w/the other 2 being syria and nicaragua but said its mostly just political pandering to his base, wont have any actual impact
[6/2/17, 1:26:08 PM] Justin: Well that depends. Because I believe it creates incentive structures for smaller nations
[6/2/17, 1:26:12 PM] Miller: also sounds like chances of HC getting done in the senate are dwindling, mcconnell been trying to soften the blow
[6/2/17, 1:26:16 PM] Justin: Which absent the us obviously doesn't exist
[6/2/17, 1:26:50 PM] Steve: Li also punched him in the face
[6/2/17, 1:26:57 PM] Steve: Best. Feeling. Ever.
[6/2/17, 1:27:07 PM] Justin: Paris agreement was a washed down shitty agreement that we likely never would have even achieved
[6/2/17, 1:31:26 PM] Justin: TBH didn't read enough on Paris agreement because when it first came was touted as a "historical achievement  " the two degrees threshold would already cause immeasurable damage
[6/2/17, 1:32:23 PM] Justin: Well measurable to the tune of a billion refugees and billions in damage to real estate.
[6/2/17, 1:34:48 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/2/17, 1:35:04 PM] Steve: To the last three texts
[6/2/17, 1:35:08 PM] Steve: Please sit down
[6/2/17, 1:35:34 PM] Steve: Scientists who literally study climate change say it's a pact that we needed to stay in
[6/2/17, 1:35:45 PM] Justin: Ok that's not what I said
[6/2/17, 1:35:59 PM] Justin: I said 2 degree target is not acceptable according to scientific community
[6/2/17, 1:36:03 PM] Justin: Google it
[6/2/17, 1:36:02 PM] Steve: But you think it was a "waged down shitty agreement"
[6/2/17, 1:36:07 PM] Steve: *washed
[6/2/17, 1:36:15 PM] Justin: It is google 2 degree climate increase
[6/2/17, 1:36:24 PM] Steve: It's a threshold
[6/2/17, 1:36:29 PM] Steve: Meaning if it gets to that
[6/2/17, 1:36:35 PM] Steve: Many of he effects would be irreversible
[6/2/17, 1:36:39 PM] Justin: Scientists fear 2 might already put us onto self perpetuating unstoppable temp increase cycle
[6/2/17, 1:36:49 PM] Steve: The steps on the agreement were steps that would help us try and get under that
[6/2/17, 1:36:52 PM] Steve: No guarantee
[6/2/17, 1:37:02 PM] Justin: As in 1.5 is considered the no turning back point
[6/2/17, 1:37:03 PM] Steve: But if we do nothing, we'll have one guarantee
[6/2/17, 1:37:19 PM] Steve: I've read that as well
[6/2/17, 1:37:29 PM] Steve: But the majority believe 2 is the threshold
[6/2/17, 1:37:39 PM] Steve: And other scientists believe it's already too late
[6/2/17, 1:37:55 PM] Justin: Yes
[6/2/17, 1:37:59 PM] Steve: By you keep saying things like "washed down shitty agreement"
[6/2/17, 1:38:07 PM] Steve: With your vast knowledge on climate change
[6/2/17, 1:38:21 PM] Steve: I'm sure republicans would love for you to advocate that on Facebook too
[6/2/17, 1:38:30 PM] Steve: Make sure you tag Donald trump
[6/2/17, 1:38:43 PM] Steve: He may even share your post
[6/2/17, 1:39:33 PM] Steve: Whether we are already doomed or not, the agreement was a way to try and prevent further damage
[6/2/17, 1:40:05 PM] Steve: And to back out of it is stupid, irresponsible and careless.
[6/2/17, 1:40:56 PM] Steve: Even if it will take 4 years to fully be out of it
[6/2/17, 1:41:07 PM] Steve: If he gets reelected, it's happening.
[6/2/17, 1:42:23 PM] Justin: Just because you accept there is a problem doesnt mean proposing any solution can solve the problem
[6/2/17, 1:42:29 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/2/17, 1:42:32 PM] Steve: I'm done
[6/2/17, 1:42:40 PM] Steve: You're right, so we should do nothing
[6/2/17, 1:42:43 PM] Steve: And hope for the best
[6/2/17, 1:42:43 PM] Justin: No
[6/2/17, 1:42:48 PM] Steve: Just keep eating mcdonalds
[6/2/17, 1:42:49 PM] Justin: Should do more obviously
[6/2/17, 1:43:15 PM] Justin: It's like healthcare bill
[6/2/17, 1:43:18 PM] Steve: Sure, but how can you do more when your president doesn't even want to do "the minimum"
[6/2/17, 1:43:25 PM] Steve: Or so t seems you are calling it
[6/2/17, 1:43:33 PM] Justin: You have an agreement that does t want to put an unfair Burden on corporations
[6/2/17, 1:43:51 PM] Justin: That's nonsensical is all I'm saying
[6/2/17, 1:44:02 PM] Steve: Actually, the healthcare bill that is in affect now doesn't care much about it
[6/2/17, 1:44:04 PM] Justin: Corporations will never want to pay for externalities of their actions
[6/2/17, 1:44:15 PM] Steve: The healthcare bill that is trying to be passed cares more about corporations
[6/2/17, 1:44:21 PM] Justin: What?
[6/2/17, 1:44:33 PM] Justin: You have a mandated private health insurance system?
[6/2/17, 1:44:34 PM] Steve: So we have Obamacare right now
[6/2/17, 1:44:51 PM] Justin: How is that not considerate of corporate interests?
[6/2/17, 1:45:14 PM] Justin: Not considerate would be saying there should be no profit in health insurance
[6/2/17, 1:45:41 PM] Steve: No, that would be not caring
[6/2/17, 1:45:54 PM] Justin: Considerate is taking a conservative bill written by health care lobbyist and labeling it as communism
[6/2/17, 1:45:54 PM] Steve: You can be considerate but still demand things
[6/2/17, 1:46:03 PM] Steve: Or still expect certain services to be met
[6/2/17, 1:46:08 PM] Steve: It's not all or nothing
[6/2/17, 1:46:31 PM] Justin: -----Mandated coverage , for profit industry
[6/2/17, 1:47:14 PM] Justin: Just so happens that the system is fucked because the mandate isn't large or enforceable enough
[6/2/17, 1:47:45 PM] Justin: Which is leading to massive increase in premiums because "hey insurance companies gotta make money after all is said and done"
[6/2/17, 1:50:29 PM] Justin: Yes there are "essential  benefits" being provided. But who cares?  In the end it's not like the insurance company eats those costs, they pass it onto the consumer in premium increases.  Which along side govt subsidy in the expansion of Medicaid(eliminating the most expensive pool) and income based premium subsidy, just incentivizes insurance companies to raise rates further.
[6/2/17, 1:51:28 PM] Launchpad: Do you think there should be no profit in healthcare or is this just theoretical?
[6/2/17, 1:51:42 PM] Justin: In insurance ?
[6/2/17, 1:52:02 PM] Justin: None.
[6/2/17, 1:52:45 PM] Launchpad: then at that point it would have to be state owned
[6/2/17, 1:52:53 PM] Justin: It's a backwards system that has historically spent a majority of its money denying claims
[6/2/17, 1:52:56 PM] Justin: Yes
[6/2/17, 1:53:07 PM] Justin: It's snake oil
[6/2/17, 1:53:32 PM] Launchpad: cause no sane person would ever get into a business if there was no profit motive.  Its reward free risk
[6/2/17, 1:53:34 PM] Justin: If you want to have our own insurance for wealthy individuals, fine
[6/2/17, 1:53:41 PM] Justin: A solutey
[6/2/17, 1:53:48 PM] Justin: Not disagreeing with you
[6/2/17, 1:54:34 PM] Launchpad: what should we do? Tell United they can't turn a profit anymore?
[6/2/17, 1:54:48 PM] Justin: Lol.
[6/2/17, 1:55:14 PM] Justin: So we currently have a system wherein the oldest and poorest are taken care of on US dollars
[6/2/17, 1:55:30 PM] Justin: Insurance companies can't make money there, so they say fuck those people.
[6/2/17, 1:56:29 PM] Justin: Me advocating for universal healthcare, isn't me advocating for no private ownership
[6/2/17, 1:56:47 PM] Launchpad: i know Im just trying to figure out where the line is
[6/2/17, 1:56:55 PM] Justin: It's me advocating for no private owenership in healthcare
[6/2/17, 1:56:56 PM] Launchpad: Don't old people have Medicare/caid?
[6/2/17, 1:57:01 PM] Justin: Yes
[6/2/17, 1:57:18 PM] Justin: Tax dollars are already taking the riskiest pool and paid for them
[6/2/17, 1:57:36 PM] Justin: Leaving private insurers with the "clean pool"
[6/2/17, 1:57:54 PM] Justin: So it's already a "socialist " scheme
[6/2/17, 1:59:08 PM] Dan Watts: Governors Ball is this weekend. I see people on the subway going. Not a single one was older than 19
[6/2/17, 1:59:30 PM] Steve: Yea, have some coworkers working it too
[6/2/17, 1:59:37 PM] Steve: Does it start tonight?
[6/2/17, 2:01:01 PM] Launchpad: what about my company? We're healthcare technology
[6/2/17, 2:02:27 PM] Dan Watts: Yes I guess you can go at any age
[6/2/17, 2:02:34 PM] Miller: ive never even heard of the headliner on sat
[6/2/17, 2:02:36 PM] Miller: phoenix?
[6/2/17, 2:02:52 PM] Launchpad: should we not be able to turn a profit? We provide technology solutions to the government & other private companies
[6/2/17, 2:03:46 PM] Steve: My man stormzy!
[6/2/17, 2:04:20 PM] Launchpad: something we agree on
[6/2/17, 2:05:03 PM] Steve: Childish on Saturday?!
[6/2/17, 2:05:08 PM] Steve: I miss that guy
[6/2/17, 2:07:22 PM] Miller: yea cant imagine spending $300 to go see him perform awaken my love
[6/2/17, 2:07:25 PM] Miller: stay woooooooooooke
[6/2/17, 2:07:42 PM] Miller: and skepta #takeover
[6/2/17, 2:08:02 PM] Steve: It's $300 for the entire weekend?
[6/2/17, 2:08:04 PM] Steve: Stupid
[6/2/17, 2:08:09 PM] Miller: probably im just guessing
[6/2/17, 2:08:20 PM] Steve: That's almost how much we paid for the air bnb each person in Austin
[6/2/17, 2:08:25 PM] Steve: And I can sleep there
[6/2/17, 2:08:25 PM] Dan Watts: If giggs was performing I'd go
[6/2/17, 2:08:37 PM] Miller: i think hes too big for this
[6/2/17, 2:08:40 PM] Justin: Considering your company already takes on govt contracts, I'd assume they would continue to do that. If a company privately consults for the insurance company, yes that would be eliminated.
[6/2/17, 2:08:41 PM] Brian Katz: What's up boners
[6/2/17, 2:09:06 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/2/17, 2:09:16 PM] Steve: @ gigs being too big
[6/2/17, 2:09:27 PM] Steve: He's def not bigger than chance
[6/2/17, 2:09:41 PM] Steve: And chance is headlining day 1
[6/2/17, 2:09:45 PM] Miller: (it was a joke)
[6/2/17, 2:09:52 PM] Steve: You gotta put lol
[6/2/17, 2:09:54 PM] Miller: so im glad you lold
[6/2/17, 2:10:02 PM] Steve: Can't read minds through texts
[6/2/17, 2:10:13 PM] Miller: figured that was sarcastic enough
[6/2/17, 2:10:15 PM] Steve: We've been over that rule many times
[6/2/17, 2:10:30 PM] Miller: considering nobody has heard of 90% of the names on that list
[6/2/17, 2:11:02 PM] Launchpad: We just won a contract from United & Optum to expand services for their tele-nurse program.....So this would just go away?
[6/2/17, 2:11:44 PM] Launchpad: A program which is designed (by a private company) to expand health services for their members
[6/2/17, 2:11:49 PM] Justin: Well we could start with a public option
[6/2/17, 2:12:02 PM] Justin: And let that company compete and see how it does
[6/2/17, 2:12:43 PM] Justin: Long Story short the private insurers would be put out of business and public option would be providing healer better insurance in the end
[6/2/17, 2:12:51 PM] Justin: Cheaper*
[6/2/17, 2:13:17 PM] Justin: And oh can market those same solutions to the fed government.
[6/2/17, 2:13:24 PM] Justin: *You can
[6/2/17, 2:14:01 PM] Justin: But why is it my job to defend the loss of say 50k jobs?  I don't see that argument coming from the other side when it cuts social programs
[6/2/17, 2:14:59 PM] Justin: Do they say oh these programs provide employment to millions of people, maybe we shouldn't cut these programs?
[6/2/17, 2:16:11 PM] Dan Watts: http://deadspin.com/enes-kanter-says-his-father-has-been-arrested-by-the-tu-1795761552
[6/2/17, 2:16:21 PM] Dan Watts: Another tolerant Islamic regime
[6/2/17, 2:16:32 PM] Launchpad: So no more profits allowed in healthcare....where does the innovation come from?
[6/2/17, 2:17:07 PM] Justin: Not healthcare. In health insurance
[6/2/17, 2:17:54 PM] Launchpad: why is your idea better than say - private companies competing to provide services for a single payer (govt)
[6/2/17, 2:18:53 PM] Launchpad: and what happens when the not for profit health insurance company loses money?
[6/2/17, 2:20:21 PM] Justin: Literally nOthing happens. It's absorbed by a bueracraxy that spends 700 billion on bombing brown people
[6/2/17, 2:20:46 PM] Justin: The big difference would be you are advocating for a middle man
[6/2/17, 2:21:13 PM] Justin: Your saying why not pay a couple of people to provide a service, which they need to profit by
[6/2/17, 2:21:17 PM] Launchpad: Whats the precedence for the federal government telling a private company they are no longer allowed to make a profit
[6/2/17, 2:21:21 PM] Justin: When you can in fact just provide that service
[6/2/17, 2:21:46 PM] Launchpad: competition allows for better price
[6/2/17, 2:22:51 PM] Justin: Scenario a. A company can run at a loss and gives reimbursement to doctors. Scenario b the company needs to make a profit and provides reimbursement
[6/2/17, 2:23:22 PM] Justin: Which will set a higher reimbursement rate
[6/2/17, 2:24:43 PM] Justin: Scenario a.  A system that is a accountable to all ends of provider providee or scenario b a system where companies end goal is to maximize profit within the law?
[6/2/17, 2:26:28 PM] Justin: To your answer government tells companies what they can and can't profit on all the time
[6/2/17, 2:26:36 PM] Justin: How come a kid can't buy tobacco?
[6/2/17, 2:26:55 PM] Justin: How come companies need to pay a min wage?
[6/2/17, 2:27:04 PM] Justin: Higher union? Pay prevailing wage ?
[6/2/17, 2:27:16 PM] Launchpad: ummm no thats a little different
[6/2/17, 2:27:25 PM] Justin: Why?
[6/2/17, 2:27:39 PM] Launchpad: because tobacco companies can still make a profit
[6/2/17, 2:27:53 PM] Justin: So then you have no argument against public option ?
[6/2/17, 2:28:47 PM] Launchpad: no I don't -- as long as for profit companies are allowed to compete against it
[6/2/17, 2:28:50 PM] Justin: It's a public ran insrueer that competes against private
[6/2/17, 2:29:02 PM] Justin: Ok so les get public option
[6/2/17, 2:29:29 PM] Justin: We agree
[6/2/17, 2:29:36 PM] Launchpad: You're assuming that a public run govt bureaucracy will be more cost efficient than a privately run competitor
[6/2/17, 2:29:44 PM] Justin: No need argue any further. I just think public option always wins out
[6/2/17, 2:29:47 PM] Justin: Yep
[6/2/17, 2:30:11 PM] Justin: I know that because it terrified insurance companies when they originally had it in Obamacare
[6/2/17, 2:30:38 PM] Launchpad: But just issuing a decree that says "United Health, you're no longer allowed to operate at a profit" seems a little insane
[6/2/17, 2:31:14 PM] Launchpad: All the executives would quit
[6/2/17, 2:31:21 PM] Launchpad: what happens to their stock?
[6/2/17, 2:31:30 PM] Justin: I don't think it's insane. I'm sure that was said when they made antitrust laws
[6/2/17, 2:31:45 PM] Justin: But antitrust laws are now logical
[6/2/17, 2:31:45 PM] Launchpad: eliminated? Shareholders lose all their money?
[6/2/17, 2:32:31 PM] Justin: I mean. Idk why I didn't think of the obvious example but umm poker
[6/2/17, 2:32:50 PM] Justin: Did you cry for Party poker stakeholders
[6/2/17, 2:32:52 PM] Donk: Today's line up is reallu good imo
[6/2/17, 2:33:39 PM] Launchpad: yup, and MMJ businesses
[6/2/17, 2:34:31 PM] Justin: Well there's your precedent
[6/2/17, 2:36:09 PM] Launchpad: if you're going to tell a company they can no longer profit you may as well shut them down
[6/2/17, 2:36:31 PM] Launchpad: Anyone whose salary has perfomance incentives will quit
[6/2/17, 2:36:36 PM] Launchpad: the entire executive level
[6/2/17, 2:37:13 PM] Launchpad: Now all you have is a shitty govt buracracy with no history in an industry running the show
[6/2/17, 2:37:26 PM] Justin: I mean what's gonna happen to btcoin
[6/2/17, 2:37:34 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/2/17, 2:37:36 PM] Justin: Companies operate within legal framework
[6/2/17, 2:37:40 PM] Justin: Investment is risky
[6/2/17, 2:37:53 PM] Justin: If legal framework changes it can wipe out an industry
[6/2/17, 2:38:23 PM] Launchpad: so why can't the public option compete against the private sector??
[6/2/17, 2:38:32 PM] Justin: Fine let it
[6/2/17, 2:38:37 PM] Justin: We are
[6/2/17, 2:38:39 PM] Justin: Agree
[6/2/17, 2:38:45 PM] Justin: That was in original bill
[6/2/17, 2:38:52 PM] Justin: Lieberman wouldn't allow it
[6/2/17, 2:39:05 PM] Justin: He joined republicans to let her filli hater
[6/2/17, 2:39:05 PM] Launchpad: are do you just have the desire create extreme turmoil based on your moral opposition to the idea of profit in the industry
[6/2/17, 2:39:09 PM] Justin: Filibuster
[6/2/17, 2:39:33 PM] Justin: Millions of people's health is more valuable than shareholders ...yes
[6/2/17, 2:39:43 PM] Justin: Not controversial to me
[6/2/17, 2:41:02 PM] Justin: The day companies pay for all the externality they create, you can come and talk to me about free market
[6/2/17, 2:41:30 PM] Justin: Can barely hold companies responsible for direct misconduct as is
[6/2/17, 2:41:46 PM] Launchpad: the day you get a job you can come talk to me about how companies should operate
[6/2/17, 2:42:59 PM] Justin: Nice Insult, I literally never told a company how to run anything though
[6/2/17, 2:43:29 PM] Steve: That's his only move!
[6/2/17, 2:43:45 PM] Launchpad: looks whos talking buddy
[6/2/17, 2:44:21 PM] Launchpad: the guy who tells me I should read more doesn't actually read books
[6/2/17, 2:44:33 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/2/17, 2:44:41 PM] Steve: I actually was referring to texts
[6/2/17, 2:44:50 PM] Steve: And I do read, just not enough for your liking
[6/2/17, 2:44:59 PM] Steve: Which no one cares what you like, clearly
[6/2/17, 2:45:44 PM] Steve: And clearly you still don't read (texts) because I've cleared it up 3 times already
[6/2/17, 2:47:29 PM] Launchpad: ok well I apologize to herman cause that was a dick line
[6/2/17, 2:49:04 PM] Steve: Major strides, guess my protest helped
[6/2/17, 2:49:24 PM] Launchpad: next up, Paris deal
[6/2/17, 2:49:51 PM] Steve: According to scientist Herman, it's a shitty deal
[6/2/17, 2:50:59 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/2/17, 2:58:14 PM] Brian Katz: If a person does Coke once a week, is that a lot of Coke? Splits a bag with his girl is the amount, don't know how big the bag is. Just asking
[6/2/17, 3:00:31 PM] Steve: Depends on how big the bag is
[6/2/17, 3:00:51 PM] Brian Katz: What about the weekly usage?
[6/2/17, 3:01:15 PM] Steve: Also, it will have serious long term affects
[6/2/17, 3:01:26 PM] Brian Katz: I know
[6/2/17, 3:01:45 PM] Steve: If he does a $50-$60 bag per week that's not a lot of coke
[6/2/17, 3:01:54 PM] Brian Katz: What are some of those affects?
[6/2/17, 3:02:20 PM] Steve: Brain slowly being eaten away
[6/2/17, 3:02:26 PM] Brian Katz: Damn
[6/2/17, 3:02:31 PM] Steve: Same with your inner nose
[6/2/17, 3:02:34 PM] Brian Katz: Going bald?
[6/2/17, 3:02:41 PM] Steve: Don't know about baldness
[6/2/17, 3:02:45 PM] Steve: But it probably won't help
[6/2/17, 3:02:52 PM] Brian Katz: That might have been hereditary
[6/2/17, 3:02:53 PM] Steve: Heart problems
[6/2/17, 3:03:00 PM] Brian Katz: I know that one
[6/2/17, 3:03:25 PM] Steve: Your mood changes after a while
[6/2/17, 3:04:36 PM] Steve: https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/cocaine/what-are-long-term-effects-cocaine-use
[6/2/17, 3:04:48 PM] Steve: Basically, no bueno
[6/2/17, 3:10:38 PM] Dan Watts: $50-60 is approx .5g; split is .25 isn't very much. Still best not to do any and this is coming from
Someone who is no stranger to the white horse
[6/2/17, 3:23:00 PM] Brian Katz: He splits a gram with his girl every Friday
[6/2/17, 3:23:33 PM] Brian Katz: My bad half a gram like you said watts
[6/2/17, 3:24:57 PM] Steve: That's a start to the weekend
[6/2/17, 3:25:01 PM] Steve: Every weekend
[6/2/17, 3:25:40 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah every weekend
[6/2/17, 3:26:14 PM] Steve: Don't think they'll be very healthy if they keep doing that
[6/2/17, 3:26:17 PM] Steve: Since when?
[6/2/17, 3:26:40 PM] Brian Katz: Since his girl moved in with him, so probably for like 6 months
[6/2/17, 3:27:17 PM] Steve: Well that's not that long but does it seem like they want to end that soon?
[6/2/17, 3:27:27 PM] Brian Katz: He's getting pissed at me for saying something about it, but I feel I wouldn't be his true friend if I turned a blind eye to it
[6/2/17, 3:27:40 PM] Brian Katz: No way that's their routine
[6/2/17, 3:27:55 PM] Dan Watts: Well if he's saying it's only .5 it's probably more
[6/2/17, 3:28:02 PM] Steve: Probably
[6/2/17, 3:28:05 PM] Steve: But assuming it isn't
[6/2/17, 3:28:11 PM] Steve: Every weekend for years
[6/2/17, 3:28:18 PM] Brian Katz: I can't call him a lair on top of it lol
[6/2/17, 3:28:18 PM] Dan Watts: Staying in and doing Yay isn't a good look
[6/2/17, 3:28:18 PM] Steve: (Assuming they don't stop)
[6/2/17, 3:28:25 PM] Steve: They don't plan on living very long
[6/2/17, 3:28:30 PM] Steve: Or at least healthy loves
[6/2/17, 3:28:33 PM] Steve: *lives
[6/2/17, 3:28:44 PM] Steve: Oh I get that
[6/2/17, 3:28:56 PM] Steve: But he probably picks up another bag when he's done with that
[6/2/17, 3:29:01 PM] Steve: Especially if he's splitting it
[6/2/17, 3:29:02 PM] Launchpad: 6 months is a long time, he should dump her and reclaim his freedom
[6/2/17, 3:29:07 PM] Brian Katz: True, that's why I'm mentioning it to him. I asked you guys if that was a lot to crowd source it
[6/2/17, 3:29:22 PM] Brian Katz: lol Scotty
[6/2/17, 3:29:23 PM] Steve: Every weekend for however long is a while
[6/2/17, 3:29:29 PM] Steve: And a lot
[6/2/17, 3:29:41 PM] Dan Watts: The hair loss thing is not real. My uncle did Coke into his 60s and has a full head of hair
[6/2/17, 3:29:55 PM] Brian Katz: I was joking about that
[6/2/17, 3:30:05 PM] Dan Watts: Lol ok
[6/2/17, 3:30:23 PM] Brian Katz: If they said Coke will make you lose your hair, no one would do it lol
[6/2/17, 3:30:39 PM] Steve: The sooner they stop, the better
[6/2/17, 3:31:11 PM] Steve: If not, they are probably (IMO) looking at shitty, unhealthy midlife crisis'
[6/2/17, 3:31:12 PM] Launchpad: not true, steroids shrink your balls and they're still pretty popular
[6/2/17, 3:31:37 PM] Brian Katz: That's what dare should have said. They should've been like drugs will shrink you dick and make you go bald. Literally no one would try it ever lol
[6/2/17, 3:32:09 PM] Brian Katz: That's you balls Scotty, what if shrunk your dick or made you go bald
[6/2/17, 3:32:27 PM] Brian Katz: You going to the hamptons millz?
[6/2/17, 3:32:28 PM] Dan Watts: Cheese and I have a business meeting @515
[6/2/17, 3:32:32 PM] Dan Watts: Making that paper tho
[6/2/17, 3:32:36 PM] Steve: Ooohhhhh shit!!!!
[6/2/17, 3:32:48 PM] Steve: Cheesewizz LLC?
[6/2/17, 3:32:52 PM] Dan Watts: Big time
[6/2/17, 3:33:04 PM] Launchpad: it is truly an honor to be bald
[6/2/17, 3:33:05 PM] Brian Katz: Thats great if that's what's going on
[6/2/17, 3:33:05 PM] Dan Watts: Celebrations after, no pussy .5 of gram shit
[6/2/17, 3:33:09 PM] Miller: Cannonball express train to the Hamptons
[6/2/17, 3:33:19 PM] Steve: Watts celebrates the partnership by doing blow off of cheeses titties
[6/2/17, 3:33:34 PM] Brian Katz: Nice you're even going to get a nice day tomorrow mike
[6/2/17, 3:33:48 PM] Dan Watts: Those hair sweaty tities
[6/2/17, 3:33:50 PM] Dan Watts: Can't wait
[6/2/17, 3:33:51 PM] Brian Katz: That's a waste of Coke
[6/2/17, 3:34:05 PM] Steve: He'll shave out a strip for you
[6/2/17, 3:34:18 PM] Brian Katz: Such hairy nip nips
[6/2/17, 3:37:47 PM] James  L: NYC blow is being cut with fentanyl right now and is extremely dangerous
[6/2/17, 3:37:54 PM] James  L: Just an FYI
[6/2/17, 3:39:15 PM] Brian Katz: What is fentanyl? And are you subscribed to blow affecienado?
[6/2/17, 3:40:29 PM] Miller: Presumably has seen people going to the hospital as a result
[6/2/17, 3:42:30 PM] Dan Watts: I thought that was in heroin
[6/2/17, 3:53:12 PM] Donk: Fenatyl is a synthetic opiod
[6/2/17, 3:53:23 PM] Donk: And dangerous as any drug out there
[6/2/17, 3:56:32 PM] Launchpad: ^^ Thats the financial headlines literally everyday
[6/2/17, 3:56:36 PM] Dan Watts: So short sided
[6/2/17, 3:56:40 PM] Dan Watts: Sighted*
[6/2/17, 3:56:45 PM] Launchpad: It actually is a fact
[6/2/17, 3:57:06 PM] Launchpad: whether or not there is a correlation is another story
[6/2/17, 3:57:48 PM] Launchpad: How about "Dow Jones following in bitcoin's steps by setting ALL TIME HIGH"
[6/2/17, 3:59:57 PM] James  L: 100 times more potent that morohine
[6/2/17, 4:36:56 PM] Launchpad: Blue Apron filing for IPO
[6/2/17, 4:37:10 PM] Launchpad: i guess they're not afraid of amazon
[6/2/17, 4:38:45 PM] Miller: Like how snapchat ipod because they're not afraid of Facebook
[6/2/17, 4:39:11 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/2/17, 4:39:55 PM] Launchpad: although I do think its a big premature to to compare Walmart with blockbuster
[6/2/17, 4:40:16 PM] Launchpad: considering that Walmart actually has taken initiative to compete with amazon
[6/2/17, 4:40:40 PM] Launchpad: the real reason I brought Walmart up is they are in my DRIP plan
[6/2/17, 4:41:27 PM] Launchpad: even skype has a new update copying snapchat
[6/2/17, 5:10:19 PM] Launchpad: Probably only interesting to Miller
[6/2/17, 5:17:30 PM] Justin: this x1000
[6/2/17, 5:18:09 PM] Justin: in 99% of cocaine users, this is clearly a lie
[6/2/17, 5:19:48 PM] Justin: LP you can't expect me to let this softball go....But how much is in bitcoin?
[6/2/17, 5:19:58 PM] Steve: #hermanthescientist
[6/2/17, 5:20:08 PM] Miller: Weird, no generalists have wanted to touch Financials for the past 5 years pre trump
[6/2/17, 5:20:23 PM] Justin: comeon cocaine isn't a drug of moderation
[6/2/17, 5:20:39 PM] Miller: Just watched the first 3 master of none, goddamn this show is making me fucking hungry
[6/2/17, 5:20:59 PM] Justin: assuming thats 2nd season, cnat rmember if first season made me hungry
[6/2/17, 5:21:24 PM] Miller: Yea 2nd
[6/2/17, 5:21:47 PM] Justin: @13478047760 im just tryign to figure out who katz is throwing under the bus
[6/2/17, 5:22:34 PM] Justin: but if you wanted to talk to presumably brad, about his cocaine habit, lecturing him on the effects of cocaine usage probably isn't the way to go about it
[6/2/17, 5:23:20 PM] Miller: Cmon Herman even I figured out it was Brad
[6/2/17, 5:23:37 PM] Justin: well i didnt know he moved in with his girlfreind
[6/2/17, 5:23:59 PM] Miller: I didn't even know he had a girlfriend
[6/2/17, 5:24:50 PM] Launchpad: From those guys i have no idea.  But I am certain there are billionaires holding it
[6/2/17, 5:25:26 PM] Launchpad: And etherium
[6/2/17, 5:26:00 PM] Justin: yeh its meant more in terms of "do you even lift"
[6/2/17, 5:26:59 PM] Justin: as in its rhetorical
[6/2/17, 5:27:20 PM] Launchpad: Gotcha
[6/2/17, 5:27:23 PM] Justin: and obnoxious
[6/2/17, 5:27:38 PM] Justin: im calling myself out on a bad joke i suppose
[6/2/17, 5:28:31 PM] Justin: still holding to cocaine statement though
[6/2/17, 5:28:36 PM] Launchpad: And as much as it's run up recently, the pullback in the last 2 weeks is positive long term and it might be a good place to enter
[6/2/17, 5:28:52 PM] Launchpad: Cant really recommend that though
[6/2/17, 5:28:57 PM] Justin: didnt know it pulled back
[6/2/17, 5:29:03 PM] Justin: let me know when i can start playing poker with it
[6/2/17, 5:29:16 PM] Justin: need more games, summertime in jersey people arent palying as much
[6/2/17, 5:30:04 PM] Justin: what pullback its at 2400?
[6/2/17, 5:30:26 PM] Miller: You should get some fresh air also, go hit up seaside heights
[6/2/17, 5:30:42 PM] Launchpad: From 2700+ back to 2000
[6/2/17, 5:31:31 PM] Launchpad: I thought that was the bubble popping ands I took some profits,  but after watching it bounce nicely I bought back in a little more plus etherium
[6/2/17, 5:31:45 PM] Justin: looks like it rebounded
[6/2/17, 5:31:54 PM] Justin: its aback at near high
[6/2/17, 5:32:42 PM] Justin: those are some fucken crazy swings though
[6/2/17, 5:32:50 PM] Justin: dropping 20% in a day
[6/2/17, 5:33:19 PM] Justin: guess it was 3 days bu still
[6/2/17, 6:00:08 PM] Steve: Also, if katz wants to have a talk with a friend about something he fears can take over his life, I call that a good friend.
[6/2/17, 6:00:47 PM] Steve: If it is brad and he reacts badly, well that's on him. He's a grown man and should feel appreciative a friend cares about him that much to broach an already difficult subject.
[6/2/17, 6:01:26 PM] Steve: But doing coke every weekend at this age is not good for anyone. No matter the amount.
[6/2/17, 6:03:03 PM] Justin: I'm just saying lecturing someone on the effects of cocaine isn't the way to go about it.
[6/2/17, 6:03:29 PM] Steve: And aziz does go on a lot of dates where they are constantly eating. It's a recurring theme but never becomes annoying because he did a great job on both seasons so far.
[6/2/17, 6:03:33 PM] Justin: Specifically coming from someone who has never done cocaine.
[6/2/17, 6:03:52 PM] Steve: He should def not lecture him
[6/2/17, 6:03:57 PM] Steve: But he should voice his concern
[6/2/17, 6:04:30 PM] Justin: Yeh it's a tough thing to navigate is all I'm saying. Talking about specific effects of cocaine is a clear path not to go down.
[6/2/17, 6:04:51 PM] Steve: And it doesn't matter if he never did cocaine
[6/2/17, 6:04:51 PM] Steve: It's not a thing where you can say "fuck you, what do you know about being a drug addict? You've never been one before!" Lol
[6/2/17, 6:05:11 PM] Steve: Oh I don't think he should do that off the bat
[6/2/17, 6:05:14 PM] Justin: I mean to a degree it is.
[6/2/17, 6:05:21 PM] Steve: It's not
[6/2/17, 6:05:28 PM] Justin: Because no one thinks they are an addict
[6/2/17, 6:05:31 PM] Steve: That's what addicts use to defend themselves
[6/2/17, 6:05:36 PM] Steve: Sure
[6/2/17, 6:05:46 PM] Steve: But that's not a reason not to voice your concern about it
[6/2/17, 6:06:02 PM] Justin: So they will naturally be dismissive
[6/2/17, 6:06:27 PM] Justin: I get that. But there is a reason addicts have other addicts as their partners in programs.
[6/2/17, 6:06:45 PM] Steve: Like if I was an addict and Miller talked to me about it and I used the "what do you know you never used it" excuse, if hope he'd laugh in my face for using that.
[6/2/17, 6:06:53 PM] Justin: But yeh no harm in voicing concern obviously, just difficult
[6/2/17, 6:07:01 PM] Steve: That's not the only reason
[6/2/17, 6:07:05 PM] Steve: But sure
[6/2/17, 6:07:15 PM] Steve: It's always going to be difficult
[6/2/17, 6:07:18 PM] Steve: Life is difficult
[6/2/17, 6:07:32 PM] Steve: But not doing something because it's difficult leads to a lot of regrets
[6/2/17, 6:07:43 PM] Steve: And shoulda, coulda, wouldas
[6/2/17, 6:07:45 PM] Justin: The what do you know is more " I'm not an addict, it's a hobby, you never used so you don't get it "
[6/2/17, 6:08:29 PM] Justin: With some truth because katz opinion is clearly cocaine is bad and shouldn't be used
[6/2/17, 6:09:35 PM] Steve: Doing cocaine isn't a hobby
[6/2/17, 6:09:42 PM] Steve: Speaking from experience
[6/2/17, 6:09:44 PM] Justin: So coming from an approach of abstinence, it's hard to connect with someone who thinks they are casual drug user. It's logical to just say you don't get it, it's not that bad.
[6/2/17, 6:09:44 PM] Steve: So if he uses that excuse, he def has a problem.
[6/2/17, 6:10:16 PM] Justin: Ok well when was last time you did cocaine?
[6/2/17, 6:10:24 PM] Steve: Sure, and I would say doing it every weekend is not good
[6/2/17, 6:10:43 PM] Justin: Agreed
[6/2/17, 6:10:57 PM] Justin: Also think .5 g is clearly a lie
[6/2/17, 6:11:19 PM] Steve: Things I do every weekend is a hobby. If it's drugs, it's a problem.
[6/2/17, 6:11:29 PM] Justin: Because like your saying. If you've ever done cocaine you know the only thing about it is when are we getting more
[6/2/17, 6:11:29 PM] Steve: I also agree with that
[6/2/17, 6:11:50 PM] Justin: So one day you wake up and say let's get 2 grams
[6/2/17, 6:11:52 PM] Steve: But you def can't accuse him of lying
[6/2/17, 6:12:10 PM] Justin: Yeh, once again, tough thing to navigate
[6/2/17, 6:12:16 PM] Justin: But clearly lying
[6/2/17, 6:12:40 PM] Justin: Now I could say that to someone. You can say that to someone.
[6/2/17, 6:12:46 PM] Justin: Katz it's difficult.
[6/2/17, 6:13:05 PM] Justin: Because he's just assuming it's very addictive
[6/2/17, 6:14:38 PM] Steve: It's always going to be a tough thing to bring up or talk about
[6/2/17, 6:14:38 PM] Steve: But every week is a concern
[6/2/17, 6:14:38 PM] Steve: And he has an enabler now too who he lives with
[6/2/17, 6:16:29 PM] Steve: It's not an assumption Herman
[6/2/17, 6:16:32 PM] Steve: It's a fact
[6/2/17, 6:16:42 PM] Steve: An assumption is he's using it more than he says
[6/2/17, 6:50:49 PM] James  L: Who are we talking about?
[6/2/17, 6:54:59 PM] Steve: Katz' boy
[6/2/17, 6:55:08 PM] Steve: Who Herman believes is this guy brad
[6/2/17, 6:55:30 PM] Steve: Keep up with the 300

[6/2/17, 7:59:08 PM] Miller: Jokes on her you are definitely a male romper kind of guy and you have highest t levels known to man
[6/2/17, 8:00:32 PM] Steve: I would wear a male romper
[6/2/17, 8:08:24 PM] Justin: Looking for Arnold in a romper. Instead found this
[6/2/17, 8:08:42 PM] Justin: Look at that fucken bar bending
[6/2/17, 8:32:48 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah he definitely said I don't know what I'm talking about, and that he's a casual user. Also not to worry because he has it under control.
[6/2/17, 8:56:54 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/2/17, 8:56:57 PM] Kiyoon: Ass to grass check out that form

[6/2/17, 9:04:47 PM] Dan Watts: Crazy thick. Bangbros status
[6/2/17, 9:10:09 PM] Miller: So confused cannot figure out who is who
[6/2/17, 9:12:00 PM] Dan Watts: This chick Yahaira you guys haven't met her. Met up with her back in January didn't really develop but she hit me up against
[6/2/17, 9:12:05 PM] Dan Watts: Again*
[6/2/17, 9:17:20 PM] Miller: And catching up I think both @16316620763 and @13478047760 are right, while it's likely this conversation will not actually have a positive impact or effect on this mysterious person it also doesn't mean katz should just sit back and do nothing because of that
[6/2/17, 9:17:20 PM] Miller: I think any of us would do the same thing if we were concerned about someone regardless of whether they would listen
[6/2/17, 9:17:20 PM] Miller: My girlfriend, she goes to another school
[6/2/17, 9:17:55 PM] Miller: This was directed here My girlfriend, she goes to another school

[6/2/17, 10:30:18 PM] Justin: Maybe he's just trying to occupy he news cycle with sensationalist things like this.
[6/2/17, 10:33:26 PM] Donk: Not that richard spencer  haha
[6/2/17, 10:33:32 PM] Donk: Its a different one

[6/3/17, 2:18:39 PM] Miller: I saw those stupid tiny coke cans for me first time the other day and looked down while I was holding it and thought of you @16102201963
[6/3/17, 2:18:50 PM] Scott: Lol
[6/3/17, 2:41:38 PM] Steve: Hypothetical, if judge hits 40 hrs and yankees win the division, does he also win the MVP?
[6/3/17, 2:41:56 PM] Miller: Probably, especially with trout going down
[6/3/17, 2:42:06 PM] Steve: I think so too
[6/3/17, 2:42:09 PM] Steve: Still very early
[6/3/17, 2:47:37 PM] Brian Katz: Judge is bonb

[6/3/17, 2:56:24 PM] Steve: Didn't think we'd develop so quickly
[6/3/17, 2:56:28 PM] Steve: Was happily wrong
[6/3/17, 2:57:21 PM] Scott: Let's go to a game
[6/3/17, 2:59:29 PM] Steve: Cheese, focus on your tutoring
[6/3/17, 3:00:27 PM] Scott: Drafting a retainer agreement.

[6/3/17, 3:13:56 PM] Miller: No way they ain't paying me #spon
[6/3/17, 3:29:08 PM] Steve: I don't know who lannie is
[6/3/17, 3:30:20 PM] Miller: Goddamn Steve you stalking me on the gram lol
[6/3/17, 3:30:28 PM] Miller: I posted that less than 30 seconds ago
[6/3/17, 3:31:55 PM] Steve: Actually 1 minute ago
[6/3/17, 3:31:55 PM] Steve: And it's called iPhone notifications
[6/3/17, 3:32:32 PM] Steve: Just so happen to be changing songs
[6/3/17, 3:33:16 PM] Miller: You get a notification whenever I post something?
[6/3/17, 3:33:57 PM] Steve: Whenever It's been awhile
[6/3/17, 3:34:13 PM] Steve: Basically you need to step your posting game up
[6/3/17, 3:34:26 PM] Steve: Because instagram isn't impressed
[6/3/17, 3:34:34 PM] Miller: Lol damn ig clowning me
[6/3/17, 3:34:52 PM] Steve: They do it to everyone if it's been more than a week or so
[6/3/17, 3:34:57 PM] Miller: I'm guessing every time I post it's been a while
[6/3/17, 3:35:17 PM] Steve: But I am also on instagram a bunch
[6/3/17, 3:35:23 PM] Steve: Or on my phone
[6/3/17, 3:36:11 PM] Miller: Damn another like, I'm on pace to break Launchpads record of 7

[6/3/17, 8:09:37 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[6/3/17, 9:14:50 PM] Brian Katz: Not bad cheese, now you get that sweet rock moranis run off
[6/3/17, 9:16:25 PM] Brian Katz: My whole row is empty now that the lights are on lol. What about you guys?

[6/4/17, 9:54:18 PM] Steve: *cavs
[6/5/17, 7:43:47 AM] Steve: He was salty on that presser
[6/5/17, 7:43:52 AM] Steve: *in
[6/5/17, 7:44:16 AM] Steve: Guy asked him about not doing it at the podium and he was like, I have a reason but I'm not telling you
[6/5/17, 8:31:25 AM] Brian Katz: I'm going to predict that Lebron will opt out of his contract, and play center for the warriors next year. Ending the NBA entirely. This season has been pointless. The NBA at this point is unwatchable, and has no parody.
[6/5/17, 8:32:28 AM] Donk: Its mind bottling how little parody there has been
[6/5/17, 8:33:00 AM] Miller: also warriors already have a center
[6/5/17, 8:33:14 AM] Miller: might not be lebron but 2nd best player in the nba isnt too shabby
[6/5/17, 9:09:38 AM] Brian Katz: Nah, they'll need Lebron to go 82-0 plus 16-0 in the playoffs
[6/5/17, 9:10:13 AM] Steve: Well they are already going 16-0
[6/5/17, 9:10:14 AM] Brian Katz: This way they can print up all the 2018 NBA champs gear early and get a better price.
[6/5/17, 9:10:20 AM] Steve: Without lebron
[6/5/17, 9:10:27 AM] Steve: But 82-0 is impossible
[6/5/17, 9:10:36 AM] Steve: They still play in a professional league
[6/5/17, 9:10:43 AM] Steve: No one will ever go undefeated
[6/5/17, 9:10:49 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah, but what about 82-0? Looking like a bunch of chumps if you ask me lol
[6/5/17, 9:12:40 AM] Brian Katz: Why? The went 73-9 without Durant
[6/5/17, 9:13:00 AM] Brian Katz: If they get Lebron they should never lose
[6/5/17, 9:21:37 AM] Steve: No one will ever go 82-0
[6/5/17, 9:21:49 AM] Steve: Same reason no one has ever gone 19-0
[6/5/17, 9:22:17 AM] Steve: And only one team has gone undefeated in the history of the NFL with a shorter season
[6/5/17, 9:22:19 AM] Miller: the giants d-line is the reason nobody will ever go 82-0?
[6/5/17, 9:22:38 AM] Steve: No, it's just too difficult in pro sports to go undefeated
[6/5/17, 9:22:56 AM] Steve: The giants dline was the reason the patriots didn't go 19-0
[6/5/17, 9:23:24 AM] Steve: Even in a relatively short season that is the NFL's 16 games
[6/5/17, 9:23:41 AM] Steve: And 3 playoff games
[6/5/17, 9:24:41 AM] Steve: Even the NBA has only had two teams in its history win 70 games
[6/5/17, 9:24:43 AM] Steve: 2
[6/5/17, 10:52:47 AM] Brian Katz: The mavericks won 70 one year I think
[6/5/17, 10:59:10 AM] Steve: Nope
[6/5/17, 10:59:16 AM] Steve: Only two teams in history
[6/5/17, 10:59:20 AM] Steve: Bulls, warriors

[6/5/17, 4:05:58 PM] Launchpad: but he can stil pull off the pedo look
[6/5/17, 4:06:30 PM] Launchpad: and its not sandusky
[6/5/17, 4:07:47 PM] Miller: fuck joepa, he does not need to be immortalized in a movie and w/o knowing anything about this im willing to bet hes portrayed in a sympathetic light
[6/5/17, 4:08:24 PM] Dan Watts: agreed. during the investigation there was ample evidence suggesting he knew what was going on and turned a blind eye
[6/5/17, 4:08:41 PM] Dan Watts: then he conveniently died before he had to answer any questions about it
[6/5/17, 4:09:05 PM] Steve: I mean, he or cancer lol
[6/5/17, 4:09:09 PM] Steve: Don't know how convenient that it
[6/5/17, 4:09:22 PM] Steve: But I do agree that he got off scott free and should have gone to jail
[6/5/17, 4:09:28 PM] Launchpad: he was about to start talking about that pizza place too wasn't he ü§î
[6/5/17, 4:09:40 PM] Launchpad: leave my name out of this
[6/5/17, 4:09:46 PM] Steve: He knew exactly what was going on and only cared about winning football games
[6/5/17, 4:13:45 PM] Dan Watts: i found it suspicious that there were no reports this guy had cancer UNTIL the sandusky shit broke.  then he suddenly had a "treatable form" of lung cancer and died 3 months later when the real shit started to become unveiled
[6/5/17, 4:14:16 PM] Steve: Well that's a bit of a conspiracy theory on that but ok
[6/5/17, 4:14:42 PM] Dan Watts: got to get Alex Jones on this
[6/5/17, 4:15:37 PM] Steve: Pretty sure cancer comes in all shapes and sizes and, even though I believe he deserved jail time as an accomplice, I don't think his cancer just conveniently happened.
[6/5/17, 4:16:08 PM] Steve: He probably had it for a while and never got it treated and it was way more advanced by the time he was diagnosed
[6/5/17, 4:16:24 PM] Dan Watts: i think that was a manufactured story, it's like Kenneth Lay mysteriously died of a heart attack instead of going to jail
[6/5/17, 4:16:49 PM] Steve: We'll agree to disagree
[6/5/17, 4:16:57 PM] Steve: No evidence of it being a cover up
[6/5/17, 4:17:10 PM] Steve: And believe me, it would have been uncovered
[6/5/17, 4:19:25 PM] Miller: http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/wifisfuneral-jumped-while-crowd-surfacing-during-xxxtentacions-performance-news.33147.html
[6/5/17, 4:19:31 PM] Miller: im sorry but thats hilariou
[6/5/17, 4:19:31 PM] Miller: s
[6/5/17, 4:19:46 PM] Miller: guy fucking cannonballs into some dudes
[6/5/17, 4:19:52 PM] Miller: gets knocked the fuck out
[6/5/17, 4:20:08 PM] Miller: then they pass his unconscious body back up to the front of the stage
[6/5/17, 4:22:21 PM] Launchpad: Ken Lay clearly got the heart attack gun to keep him from talking
[6/5/17, 4:33:17 PM] Justin: pretty sure netflix is literally producing a Scorsese production of monster proportion which would indicate Pacino isn't yet over the gangster film realm
[6/5/17, 4:34:37 PM] Launchpad: only a theory
[6/5/17, 4:34:44 PM] Launchpad: unlike the kenneth lay 'heart attack'
[6/5/17, 4:34:45 PM] Justin: with all these old people dying it could also be that the stress of these things really expedites the death process
[6/5/17, 4:34:59 PM] Justin: but yeh you never know
[6/5/17, 4:35:19 PM] Launchpad: I was thinking that too. JoePa was like 90
[6/5/17, 4:35:20 PM] Justin: I mean its not like 2 shots to the head suicide like gary webb
[6/5/17, 4:35:22 PM] Justin: but still
[6/5/17, 4:35:24 PM] Miller: he was 85
[6/5/17, 4:35:31 PM] Miller: you dont need an excuse to die at 85
[6/5/17, 5:08:53 PM] Launchpad: I think protecting pedophiles is a good excuse to die
[6/5/17, 5:33:14 PM] Steve: Couldn't actually agree with you more
[6/5/17, 5:33:39 PM] Steve: He was a piece of shit and anyone who honors any of those staff members who turned a blind eye to Sandusky should be in jail
[6/5/17, 5:43:35 PM] Launchpad: I thought that was Leslie Neilson at first...
[6/5/17, 5:44:43 PM] Miller: more like ashley shaffer
[6/5/17, 5:45:30 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/5/17, 5:46:38 PM] Steve: You're fucking out, I'm fucking in.
[6/5/17, 6:05:38 PM] Brian Katz: That's the nature boy! Woooooooo
[6/5/17, 6:14:05 PM] James  L: Just ordered that shirt
[6/5/17, 7:06:42 PM] Brian Katz: Nice
[6/5/17, 8:44:48 PM] Kiyoon: That's mad old
[6/5/17, 8:48:05 PM] Miller: Yea it says since 1992
[6/5/17, 8:49:48 PM] Steve: I think he means he saw it a while ago on the interwebs
[6/5/17, 8:49:57 PM] Steve: You're late to the party
[6/5/17, 8:50:22 PM] Steve: We just don't have a meme for that
[6/5/17, 8:50:45 PM] Miller: In that case I'll tell him the same thing I tell everyone else, thanks for not sharing dick
[6/5/17, 8:50:55 PM] Miller: New launchpad me or keep it moving
[6/5/17, 8:51:33 PM] Kiyoon: lolz
[6/5/17, 8:51:51 PM] Steve: It's technically not a new launchpad
[6/6/17, 6:17:52 AM] Miller: Woke up to find my entire Facebook feed just @16318489683 and @16316620763 going at each other in every post
[6/6/17, 6:57:59 AM] Scott: Sadly I can't find this.
[6/6/17, 7:32:41 AM] Steve: ^ironically, that's also the first thing a woman says after she pulls down your pants.
[6/6/17, 7:35:55 AM] Scott: False.
[6/6/17, 7:36:10 AM] Brian Katz: Burned lol
[6/6/17, 7:36:51 AM] Scott: Alternate facts
[6/6/17, 7:36:55 AM] Scott: Alternative
[6/6/17, 7:39:24 AM] Brian Katz: You see cheeses, steve is saying, when a woman takes your pants off to attack your ween, she simply cannot find it lol
[6/6/17, 7:39:45 AM] Scott: I understand that. But it's just completely false.
[6/6/17, 7:41:27 AM] Brian Katz: I don't think you get it. He's saying your pee pee is too small to see with the naked eye. Even if the pee pee grabber was inches away, it'd be still to far away to see it.
[6/6/17, 7:42:05 AM] Scott: I get it. Ur putting this joke into the joke graveyard. As a person who knows what that is like I can certainly attest to it.
[6/6/17, 7:42:06 AM] Miller: youre wasting your breath katz, hes never gonna get it
[6/6/17, 7:42:22 AM] Steve: What's a pee pee grabber? Sounds like a character in a Sesame Street porn.
[6/6/17, 7:42:23 AM] Scott: R.i.p. to that joke.
[6/6/17, 7:45:59 AM] Brian Katz: Let me try this one last time cheese. Steve is trying to say that even if you were right next to your schmeckle.m, it'd still be unseeable. If navy seal sniper team had to take your weenis out, they'd go home without a confirmed kill. Steves is trying to say that when you grab you cocktail frank, it looks like King Kong grabbing Faye ray. He's saying you're dick is small brah!
[6/6/17, 7:47:08 AM] Brian Katz: A pee pee grabber is a person that grabs pee pees steve, duh
[6/6/17, 7:54:18 AM] Scott: Pee pee grabber a.k.a. Steve "pee pee grabber" merenea
[6/6/17, 7:54:22 AM] Scott: Merenes
[6/6/17, 7:56:26 AM] Steve: Oooofff, try again cheese
[6/6/17, 7:56:36 AM] Scott: Nope. I'm good.
[6/6/17, 7:56:41 AM] Steve: This time have your lady write it
[6/6/17, 7:57:17 AM] Scott: Nah I'm good
[6/6/17, 8:30:06 AM] Sean: It's not more expensive then the supermarket?
[6/6/17, 8:30:19 AM] Miller: idk
[6/6/17, 8:30:36 AM] Miller: i dont go food shopping enough to know what the prices of things are
[6/6/17, 8:30:59 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl_Qyk9DSUw
[6/6/17, 8:31:45 AM] Miller: from what i read seems like some things are slightly more expensive (local/fresh stuff) and some of the packaged stuff is slightly cheaper so idk
[6/6/17, 8:31:54 AM] Miller: real question is what is saving  6-8 hours/month worth
[6/6/17, 9:14:47 AM] Kiyoon: Costco brah
[6/6/17, 9:16:46 AM] Donk: We used to get peapod (stop and shops grocery delivery) when we lived in the bronx. It was ok, as they just did an ok job picki g out good produce.  However, tbe best part was that they would always forget something,  and id call and complain and get 10.00 off and free delivery
[6/6/17, 9:17:07 AM] Donk: It was a good deal for groceries as a result
[6/6/17, 9:17:21 AM] Donk: We havent done it since moving to the suburbs though
[6/6/17, 9:17:43 AM] Brian Katz: Costco is great for cleaning supplies
[6/6/17, 9:17:56 AM] Donk: Love costco for everything haha
[6/6/17, 9:18:25 AM] Miller: costco not great for "normal" grocery shopping
[6/6/17, 9:18:36 AM] Miller: plus thats a 2 hr trip minimum
[6/6/17, 9:20:13 AM] Donk: Its fkr staples
[6/6/17, 9:20:23 AM] Donk: Like peanut butter or cereal
[6/6/17, 9:20:25 AM] Brian Katz: I hate the lines, it's a mad house. I'd never go there weekly, but once every other month for paper towels, toilet paper and cleaners isn't so bad
[6/6/17, 9:23:45 AM] Donk: i run a different scam now for cheap groceries by using the meal delivery services. we order blue apron with a half off promo coupon, and then cancel right away. then i have liz do the same under her email. in the meantime, they will then send me another half off coupon if i order again; wash and repeat. (generally they send the 2nd coupon like a month later. you can also mix in hello fresh, or any of the other ones, with the same plan if you want the delivery weekly)
[6/6/17, 9:25:26 AM] Brian Katz: Damn, you going to hell Donk
[6/6/17, 9:25:49 AM] Donk: hey, not my fault they keep sending me coupons
[6/6/17, 9:26:11 AM] Donk: its not like im making 100 email addresses and scamming them that way. its just the one singular email address they keep sending offers to
[6/6/17, 9:26:59 AM] Donk: (or actually 2 if you count liz's email, but since we are 2 people, i think its ok)
[6/6/17, 9:28:50 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 9:29:20 AM] Steve: The donkzi scheme
[6/6/17, 9:30:06 AM] Donk: in the end, i dont think its any more shady than their business model of automatic deliveries, where if you order and dont cancel, they will keep sending you stuff over and over again
[6/6/17, 9:30:09 AM] Brian Katz: I'll remember you said that when they drag you away Donk. The blue apron thief
[6/6/17, 9:30:29 AM] Donk: they caught me blue-handed.....
[6/6/17, 9:30:31 AM] Steve: Worst villain name ever
[6/6/17, 9:31:15 AM] Brian Katz: The blue apron caper
[6/6/17, 9:31:36 AM] Steve: Eh
[6/6/17, 9:33:04 AM] Brian Katz: Donk the big PUSSE, and his plan to get cheaper food.
[6/6/17, 9:35:41 AM] Miller: solid start to the day
[6/6/17, 9:36:13 AM] Donk: i watched like 4 or 5 episodes this past weekend, was a great trip down memory lane
[6/6/17, 9:36:27 AM] Miller: pre-revival so good
[6/6/17, 9:36:38 AM] Donk: yeah, was season 2
[6/6/17, 9:36:46 AM] Donk: hopefully this new season will be better than the last one
[6/6/17, 9:37:01 AM] Brian Katz: I liked season 4 a lot, you didn't miller?
[6/6/17, 9:37:15 AM] Miller: im assuming they still arent filming together so im not expecting much
[6/6/17, 9:37:22 AM] Miller: season 4 was like a completely different show
[6/6/17, 9:37:25 AM] Donk: yeah, that was the main problem with season 4
[6/6/17, 10:23:29 AM] Launchpad: season 4 was good though
[6/6/17, 10:23:35 AM] Launchpad: they're making a season 5 aren't they?
[6/6/17, 10:23:56 AM] Launchpad: btw you fuckers call me cheap I don't scam grocery delivery services
[6/6/17, 10:24:18 AM] Launchpad: How is Blue Apron, I've been thinking of doing it?
[6/6/17, 10:24:19 AM] Launchpad: maybe I should sign up a few times
[6/6/17, 10:24:42 AM] Steve: We call you cheap, not criminal
[6/6/17, 10:24:50 AM] Steve: Only donk breaks the coupon laws
[6/6/17, 10:24:55 AM] Steve: #birdlaw
[6/6/17, 10:26:40 AM] Launchpad: i just don't like paying for bottle service or restaurants that got bad reviews on yelp
[6/6/17, 10:27:06 AM] Miller: lol @ using yelp reviews for a nightclub
[6/6/17, 10:27:24 AM] Miller: in general lol @ using yelp reviews for anything remotely expensive
[6/6/17, 10:27:47 AM] Donk: i think the quality of food is slightly higher with blue apron vs hello fresh
[6/6/17, 10:27:57 AM] Donk: but overall, the service is good
[6/6/17, 10:28:06 AM] Donk: it takes all the pain out of shopping since everything is pre portioned
[6/6/17, 10:28:14 AM] Miller: they charged me $300 for a bottle of vodka that costs $23 at the liquor store, 1 star
[6/6/17, 10:28:25 AM] Donk: and you dont end up buying 3 ounces of somehing to use two tablespoons of it and then it sits in the cupboard forever
[6/6/17, 10:28:35 AM] Miller: they wouldnt let me in wearing shorts and socks and sandals, 1 star
[6/6/17, 10:29:08 AM] Donk: we had it last week, the recipies were nashville hot chicken, some korean chicken dish, and ramen. all three were good
[6/6/17, 10:30:02 AM] Launchpad: lol I just had nashville hot chicken at kfc yesterday
[6/6/17, 10:30:34 AM] Launchpad: and yes paying $300 for a $23 bottle is dumb. Bottle service is dumb
[6/6/17, 10:30:34 AM] Donk: im a fan of hot chicken though ahvent had the kfc version
[6/6/17, 10:31:21 AM] Launchpad: Can't stand for 3-4 hours, must get bottle service üò≠
[6/6/17, 10:31:37 AM] Miller: paying 30k for a car is dumb, just get a scooter
[6/6/17, 10:31:41 AM] Miller: return your tesla
[6/6/17, 10:31:42 AM] Launchpad: Only go to a club once a year, must get bottle service üò≠
[6/6/17, 10:31:53 AM] Miller: i need to go from point A to point B
[6/6/17, 10:31:56 AM] Miller: go buy a used honda
[6/6/17, 10:32:35 AM] Miller: i need to spend $300 on an awful stupid looking shirt
[6/6/17, 10:32:37 AM] Launchpad: if you're going to spend that kind of money on good seats, it may as well be at a concert or a game
[6/6/17, 10:32:39 AM] Donk: nothing wrong with a honda
[6/6/17, 10:32:41 AM] Miller: b/c kohls doesnt sell ones for $10
[6/6/17, 10:32:49 AM] Miller: how much you think that cost to make? 50c?
[6/6/17, 10:32:53 AM] Steve: Also, at a club you will spend close to the same buying individual drinks/drinks for women
[6/6/17, 10:32:59 AM] Launchpad: I never spent $300 on a shirt
[6/6/17, 10:33:09 AM] Steve: Yea, put respek on hondas name
[6/6/17, 10:33:17 AM] Donk: honda drivers unite!
[6/6/17, 10:33:22 AM] Steve: Cr-V 4 lyfe
[6/6/17, 10:33:45 AM] Launchpad: steve how many women are you buying drinks for a night???
[6/6/17, 10:33:53 AM] Steve: Mr Audi over there is too good for us
[6/6/17, 10:34:14 AM] Steve: Even with one, how many drinks on average you buying?
[6/6/17, 10:34:16 AM] Steve: 2-3?
[6/6/17, 10:34:19 AM] Steve: 3-4?
[6/6/17, 10:34:23 AM] Miller: as someone who has no intention of buying a drink for a woman the math still works
[6/6/17, 10:34:26 AM] Steve: Then shots
[6/6/17, 10:34:37 AM] Donk: speaking of honda, just got a "gift" in the mail from them last night for my 1 year car purchase anniversary. the gift: a micro fiber cleaning cloth lol
[6/6/17, 10:34:41 AM] Miller: 25 drinks per bottle
[6/6/17, 10:34:43 AM] Miller: $20 per drink
[6/6/17, 10:34:47 AM] Miller: bottle should cost $500
[6/6/17, 10:34:49 AM] Miller: it costs less
[6/6/17, 10:34:53 AM] Miller: herp derp
[6/6/17, 10:35:09 AM] Steve: Usually between 10-15
[6/6/17, 10:35:14 AM] Steve: Unless you are in the city
[6/6/17, 10:35:22 AM] Steve: Per drink
[6/6/17, 10:35:27 AM] Miller: at the places we are getting BS
[6/6/17, 10:35:30 AM] Miller: drinks are $20
[6/6/17, 10:35:42 AM] Steve: Vegas, most likely
[6/6/17, 10:35:53 AM] Steve: Montreal we went baller but I'm a fan
[6/6/17, 10:36:03 AM] Steve: Only turn 30 once
[6/6/17, 10:36:26 AM] Miller: should have just gone to mcdonalds and drank some mouthwash
[6/6/17, 10:36:27 AM] Miller: way cheaper
[6/6/17, 10:36:40 AM] Steve: Now you are going to the extreme
[6/6/17, 10:36:49 AM] Steve: That's rich jones status
[6/6/17, 10:38:22 AM] Miller: i just saved you 30k, thats enough for bottle service into perpetuity, youre welcome
[6/6/17, 10:40:05 AM] Launchpad: üòÇüòÇ no chance you get 25 drinks in one bottle
[6/6/17, 10:40:27 AM] Miller: you have a hard time with math dont you
[6/6/17, 10:40:30 AM] Miller: okay lets do it differently
[6/6/17, 10:40:35 AM] Miller: 12 "doubles"
[6/6/17, 10:40:42 AM] Miller: which would be $40 each at a bar
[6/6/17, 10:40:47 AM] Miller: spoiler alert, the math is the same
[6/6/17, 10:40:49 AM] Launchpad: was actually cheap enough in MTL it made sense. Vegas they rip you off
[6/6/17, 10:41:18 AM] Miller: you can consider a bottle 1 drink if you want, it would still cost you $500 to get that much liquor at the bar inside a club
[6/6/17, 10:42:29 AM] Launchpad: that assumes the bartender is making exact pours - which is rare
[6/6/17, 10:42:55 AM] Miller: not rare at all, all those places use those little things
[6/6/17, 10:43:16 AM] Miller: this isnt a dive bar with some townie behind the bar free wheeling it
[6/6/17, 10:43:51 AM] Miller: and so what your saying is essentially your entire thesis on BS being a ripoff comes down to the assumption the bartender inside a club will consistently over-pour your drinks
[6/6/17, 10:43:54 AM] Miller: seems logical
[6/6/17, 10:44:21 AM] Miller: on the flip side BS is a great deal b/c i assume the waitress will forget to put one of the bottles on our bill
[6/6/17, 10:45:19 AM] Launchpad: I also don't need to go out and drink 10 of the most expensive drinks
[6/6/17, 10:45:31 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 10:45:45 AM] Steve: Guy, any drink at those places starts at 10-15
[6/6/17, 10:45:48 AM] Steve: At least
[6/6/17, 10:45:57 AM] Launchpad: and bartenders always overpour even when they use the scoop
[6/6/17, 10:46:11 AM] Steve: That's not true at all
[6/6/17, 10:46:11 AM] Miller: so if a vegeterian says all you can eat $25 meat at salt lick is a rip off is that a true statement?
[6/6/17, 10:46:25 AM] Steve: They actually have pourers that measure out a shot
[6/6/17, 10:46:33 AM] Steve: At clubs
[6/6/17, 10:46:44 AM] Launchpad: I know they have pourers
[6/6/17, 10:46:51 AM] Steve: Doesn't seem like you know
[6/6/17, 10:47:04 AM] Miller: esp considering you called it a scoop
[6/6/17, 10:47:17 AM] Miller: i think maybe you got it mixed up w/an ice cream shop
[6/6/17, 10:47:33 AM] Miller: some of those places do still tend to give you extra even if they use a scoop
[6/6/17, 10:47:42 AM] Steve: At dive bars, I'd agree they don't give a fuck
[6/6/17, 10:47:54 AM] Steve: At clubs, that's their bread and butter.
[6/6/17, 10:48:03 AM] Steve: They don't serve food
[6/6/17, 10:48:28 AM] Miller: yea those high end places dont fuck around with that, they count those bottles down to the ounce
[6/6/17, 10:48:32 AM] Steve: Usually they don't, at least
[6/6/17, 10:48:49 AM] Steve: And the only other income is BS and cover
[6/6/17, 10:49:10 AM] Miller: pretty sure nobody besides LP pays cover
[6/6/17, 10:49:10 AM] Steve: Meanwhile they have to pay a hundred employees and all other costs associated with it
[6/6/17, 10:50:06 AM] Launchpad: I get on the guest list and avoid the lines
[6/6/17, 10:50:23 AM] Launchpad: and cover
[6/6/17, 10:50:25 AM] Miller: thats what your $300 shirt gets you?
[6/6/17, 10:50:36 AM] Launchpad: i wouldn't know what a $300 shirt gets me
[6/6/17, 10:50:59 AM] Miller: ill also challenge your ability to get on any guest list and avoid cover/line at any A club in vegas
[6/6/17, 10:51:30 AM] Steve: #Aclubchallenge2017
[6/6/17, 10:51:31 AM] Launchpad: its happened many times
[6/6/17, 10:52:22 AM] Launchpad: I know a promoter out there
[6/6/17, 10:52:35 AM] Launchpad: got in free for tiesto
[6/6/17, 10:53:37 AM] Miller: o lord
[6/6/17, 10:53:46 AM] Miller: okay and i know the owner of the club so bottle service is all comped
[6/6/17, 10:53:50 AM] Miller: does that now make it a great deal?
[6/6/17, 10:53:54 AM] Launchpad: did not spend $300
[6/6/17, 10:54:14 AM] Launchpad: when that happens let me know
[6/6/17, 10:54:52 AM] Miller: you realize taking situations completely non applicable to a normal person and using it as rationalization for an argument is insane right?
[6/6/17, 10:55:24 AM] Miller: its like me telling you should invest in my hedge fund b/c we dont charge fees
[6/6/17, 10:55:31 AM] Miller: i mean we do charge fees to you, but not for employees like me
[6/6/17, 10:56:00 AM] Miller: you should use my dad as your accountant, he doesnt even charge to do his taxes
[6/6/17, 11:01:16 AM] Launchpad: Except when you're a promoter in Vegas, its your job to get people into certain clubs, and you do that by giving discounted access.  Its not that hard to find a promoter or deal online to get you some kind of hookup
[6/6/17, 11:01:25 AM] Launchpad: for example....Instagram
[6/6/17, 11:01:50 AM] Miller: ah yes groups of dudes, the holy grail for promoters, just cant wait to get them in the door
[6/6/17, 11:02:37 AM] Launchpad: like I've said - bottle service USUALLY isn't the best bet - sometimes it is
[6/6/17, 11:03:18 AM] Launchpad: if you show up at 11:30 with 10 guys and the line is down the block and you don't want to wait 2 hours, then bottle service is probably your only option
[6/6/17, 11:03:22 AM] Miller: yes its not a good bet if you a) dont drink b) dont go to a club c) go with 2 or less people or d) know someone who can somehow hook you up with something better
[6/6/17, 11:03:45 AM] Launchpad: a) don't drink 10+ drinks
[6/6/17, 11:03:56 AM] Miller: that was included in a
[6/6/17, 11:04:22 AM] Miller: having 1-2 drinks is not drinking
[6/6/17, 11:04:41 AM] Launchpad: if your drinking 10+ drinks everytime you go out I suggest pregaming or investing in a flask
[6/6/17, 11:05:10 AM] Miller: if im at a club for 4-6 hours i dont think 10+ drinks is really that much
[6/6/17, 11:05:16 AM] Miller: and i do pregame
[6/6/17, 11:05:42 AM] Steve: #wegohard
[6/6/17, 11:06:36 AM] Launchpad: this is really a question quora
[6/6/17, 11:06:53 AM] Miller: yea this is something i need answered by a bunch of computer nerds
[6/6/17, 11:07:01 AM] Miller: might be a worse sample bias than yelp
[6/6/17, 11:08:28 AM] Launchpad: quora is not just a bunch of computer nerds, its a worldwide community
[6/6/17, 11:09:25 AM] Miller: you said it is geared towards CS/engineering
[6/6/17, 11:09:49 AM] Miller: i mean sure yelp isnt 100% a bunch of entitled hipster douches but it certainly is biased that way
[6/6/17, 11:11:08 AM] Kiyoon: Miller going HAM today
[6/6/17, 11:11:59 AM] Miller: im tired and cranky
[6/6/17, 11:12:52 AM] Miller: i have no intention or desire to actually do any kind of BS in austin so this debate is entirely hypothetical and pointless b/c could be years before next time me and LP are in the same place in which BS is even an option
[6/6/17, 11:21:01 AM] Scott: #isthisthelasttrip?
[6/6/17, 11:21:09 AM] Scott: #areyougonnabreakLP'sankletoo?
[6/6/17, 11:21:19 AM] Steve: No, we are going bigger and better every year
[6/6/17, 11:21:34 AM] Miller: idk if they have bottle service in iceland
[6/6/17, 11:21:38 AM] Steve: Tulum 2018
[6/6/17, 11:21:40 AM] Miller: so im not gonna worry about it yet
[6/6/17, 11:21:49 AM] Steve: Na, Mexico first
[6/6/17, 11:21:56 AM] Steve: Then I'll bring Chicago back in the mix
[6/6/17, 11:22:25 AM] Miller: probably still not going to want to die from gun violence in 3 years
[6/6/17, 11:22:27 AM] Miller: but maybe
[6/6/17, 11:23:10 AM] Steve: Because all of Chicago is riddled by gun violence
[6/6/17, 11:23:25 AM] Steve: Not just very concentrated pockets
[6/6/17, 11:23:41 AM] Miller: i guess decent odds i get kidnapped by the cartel in mexico first
[6/6/17, 11:23:42 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 11:23:46 AM] Miller: so fair enough
[6/6/17, 11:23:48 AM] Steve: Absolutely
[6/6/17, 11:24:04 AM] Steve: Or at least get swindled by the corrupt cops down in Mexico
[6/6/17, 11:24:10 AM] Steve: Before getting shot in Chicago
[6/6/17, 11:25:03 AM] Kiyoon: we'd have so much fun in chicago
[6/6/17, 11:25:09 AM] Kiyoon: that place is awesome
[6/6/17, 11:25:24 AM] Steve: According to Miller news, we'd get shot
[6/6/17, 11:27:46 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 11:28:19 AM] Steve: Well then you know Obama is from Kenya and climate change is a Chinese hoax
[6/6/17, 11:28:22 AM] Steve: Clearly
[6/6/17, 11:34:24 AM] Miller: also if im breaking anyones ankle this year it will be yours cheese
[6/6/17, 11:37:10 AM] Scott: i don't think i'm coming at this point, although ill know by weeks end for certain
[6/6/17, 11:37:15 AM] Scott: so you'll have to be breaking my ankle intrastate
[6/6/17, 11:37:28 AM] Miller: gf wont give you a hall pass?
[6/6/17, 11:37:35 AM] Scott: not my gf
[6/6/17, 11:37:35 AM] Donk: lol, leaving launchpad high and dry on the room
[6/6/17, 11:37:41 AM] Miller: or launchpad wanted you to pay for the airbnb up front?
[6/6/17, 11:37:45 AM] Scott: and i am picking a federal jury on july 5
[6/6/17, 11:37:58 AM] Scott: and i told LP this so he knows
[6/6/17, 11:38:02 AM] Scott: i told him ill reconfirm
[6/6/17, 11:38:08 AM] Scott: but its looking doubtful
[6/6/17, 11:38:16 AM] Scott: ill really know by friday day's end
[6/6/17, 11:38:27 AM] Scott: i'm not happy about it
[6/6/17, 11:40:47 AM] Miller: you should at least pay LP for the room
[6/6/17, 11:43:22 AM] Scott: i'll have to simulcast from my office
[6/6/17, 11:44:08 AM] Steve: Can someone tell cheese we'll be back July 2nd
[6/6/17, 11:44:18 AM] Steve: Literally 3 days before he has to do anything
[6/6/17, 11:44:33 AM] Scott: can someone tell steve that picking a jury in federal court and trying a complicated civil rights case takes weeks to prepare for
[6/6/17, 11:44:45 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 11:44:52 AM] Steve: So we are weeks out
[6/6/17, 11:44:54 AM] Steve: Prepare
[6/6/17, 11:45:04 AM] Steve: And then go to Austin for 4 days
[6/6/17, 11:45:06 AM] Scott: can someone tell steve i have other things to do besides prepare for this
[6/6/17, 11:45:14 AM] Steve: What's that?
[6/6/17, 11:45:20 AM] Scott: what else
[6/6/17, 11:45:20 AM] Scott: i dunno
[6/6/17, 11:45:23 AM] Scott: a trial next week

[6/6/17, 11:45:25 AM] Scott: for a different case
[6/6/17, 11:45:35 AM] Steve: Come over my crib and chill?
[6/6/17, 11:45:36 AM] Scott: among other things
[6/6/17, 11:45:50 AM] Scott: right, i do come over to your crib and chill and assist in LSAT preparation when i'm not working
[6/6/17, 11:45:59 AM] Scott: and on another note
[6/6/17, 11:46:11 AM] Scott: judge isnt ruling on motions in limine etc until a week before, leaving me one week to cram in all sorts of shit i can't do now
[6/6/17, 11:46:13 AM] Steve: Well maybe you should cut that out and focus on the shot you have to get done
[6/6/17, 11:46:16 AM] Scott: but again, you know steve, you went to bird lawschool
[6/6/17, 11:46:18 AM] Scott: ur good
[6/6/17, 11:46:41 AM] Steve: I don't need to go to bird law school to learn time management
[6/6/17, 11:46:42 AM] Scott: üïälawschool

[6/6/17, 11:47:13 AM] Steve: It's the truth
[6/6/17, 11:47:22 AM] Steve: You clearly are bad at time management
[6/6/17, 11:47:35 AM] Scott: you're right, i must be, because i'm wasting my time talking to you, now i'm done.

[6/6/17, 11:48:18 AM] Steve: You should

[6/6/17, 11:52:31 AM] Scott: I'll be nice and send u scheduling order instead
[6/6/17, 11:52:40 AM] Steve: He can't, he has to prepare for a wedding in December

[6/6/17, 11:57:22 AM] Miller: to be fair this also isnt anything

[6/6/17, 12:09:06 PM] Justin: A racist conservative mouth breather asking for people to pay for her medical bills because she was fired for being to racist for Breitbart---America
[6/6/17, 12:10:05 PM] Miller: seems tame to get her fired from there tbh
[6/6/17, 12:11:33 PM] Justin: yeh but also- ive drank enough Irish car bombs to recognize the silliness of such a statement
[6/6/17, 12:13:08 PM] Dan Watts: First- my experience in fed court is they don't adjourn trials unless there is extraordinary circumstances. Second- So you agreed to adjourn case to when there was a trip planned months in advance?
[6/6/17, 12:19:28 PM] Scott: i didn't adjourn it, one of dfense attys did b/c she got hip replacement surgery
[6/6/17, 12:19:37 PM] Scott: and second, i didnt agree, judge ordered it.  didn't ask for anything
[6/6/17, 12:20:24 PM] Miller: well at least now she has that 2 weeks to recover from the hip replacement
[6/6/17, 12:20:33 PM] Scott: lol
[6/6/17, 12:20:36 PM] Scott: it was a cuple months ago
[6/6/17, 12:20:50 PM] Miller: adjourn it again
[6/6/17, 12:20:53 PM] Scott: she is going through therapy and has another case laso to try that was ordered
[6/6/17, 12:20:56 PM] Scott: i can't adjourn it
[6/6/17, 12:20:58 PM] Scott: i wish i could
[6/6/17, 12:20:59 PM] Scott: i tried
[6/6/17, 12:21:11 PM] Miller: just getting steamrolled
[6/6/17, 12:42:45 PM] Steve: Can we adjourn you from the league?
[6/6/17, 1:30:11 PM] Brian Katz: Quick game of thrones question. You think Sam gets his higher mysteries link from the maesters and goes back north to help jon?
[6/6/17, 1:33:22 PM] Kiyoon: maybe next season
[6/6/17, 1:35:36 PM] Miller: is this the last one or are they breaking it up into 19 parts?
[6/6/17, 1:47:25 PM] Kiyoon: 2 7 episode seasons right
[6/6/17, 1:50:17 PM] Donk: For sure, but maybe not this season
[6/6/17, 2:03:35 PM] Brian Katz: Is that Dylan? Lol

[6/6/17, 5:57:44 PM] Steve: @16313981203, you create it yet?
[6/6/17, 5:59:15 PM] Dan Watts: @Brad
[6/6/17, 6:01:56 PM] Miller: I'm too lazy to look but I think that's actually a very old new launchpad
[6/6/17, 6:02:48 PM] Dan Watts: I think I may have posted it
[6/6/17, 6:04:11 PM] Miller: Most likely
[6/6/17, 6:06:15 PM] Steve: Ooooouuuuu, watch out, he might throw you into a wall one handed
[6/6/17, 6:06:44 PM] Dan Watts: already apologized for that, we don't have to revisit this
[6/6/17, 6:07:09 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 6:07:09 PM] Steve: I can't even joke about that?
[6/6/17, 6:07:09 PM] Steve: Damn son

[6/6/17, 6:07:46 PM] Dan Watts: haha it's fine i couldn't tell you if you were joshing or not
[6/6/17, 6:08:23 PM] Steve: At this point, I absolutely am
[6/6/17, 6:08:36 PM] Steve: But I can add an lol for clarification next time boo üòò
[6/6/17, 6:09:24 PM] Miller: Time heals all wounds
[6/6/17, 6:09:27 PM] Miller: Except for my wall
[6/6/17, 6:10:14 PM] Dan Watts: Lol ok cool
[6/6/17, 6:10:32 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 6:10:40 PM] Steve: Plaster and white paint

[6/6/17, 6:10:51 PM] Steve: Or just never move that chair
[6/6/17, 6:10:58 PM] Dan Watts: @15166335046 get Phil down to do a spackle and sand job
[6/6/17, 6:11:02 PM] Justin: just coming in for a reminder 8-1
[6/6/17, 6:11:10 PM] Justin: ouch means someone was 1-8
[6/6/17, 6:11:11 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/6/17, 6:11:16 PM] Steve: Herman and Steve
[6/6/17, 6:11:26 PM] Steve: You see how they stayed real quiet about it?
[6/6/17, 6:11:41 PM] Steve: I mean, it's hard to lose 8 of 9
[6/6/17, 6:11:41 PM] Miller: I'll allow Herman to celebrate the only time he's ever been on the winning side of a beer pong night
[6/6/17, 6:11:48 PM] Justin: mostly steve with herman getting all the hype
[6/6/17, 6:11:52 PM] Dan Watts: I think it was 1-6
[6/6/17, 6:12:08 PM] Steve: lol
[6/6/17, 6:12:14 PM] Dan Watts: I couldn't even see cups by game 7
[6/6/17, 6:12:16 PM] Steve: You might have passed out for the last two
[6/6/17, 6:12:23 PM] Justin: you can rewrite a trumpian history all you would like
[6/6/17, 6:12:36 PM] Miller: I also let you win because I felt bad for watts beating you up
[6/6/17, 6:12:39 PM] Steve: #alternativefacts
[6/6/17, 6:13:00 PM] Miller: I was not in good shape for that 2nd series
[6/6/17, 6:13:15 PM] Steve: None of us were
[6/6/17, 6:13:18 PM] Miller: Should not have started drinking at 3
[6/6/17, 6:16:29 PM] Miller: I flew too close to the sun because I felt fine after the first series
[6/6/17, 6:16:30 PM] Miller: It was certainly 1-8
[6/6/17, 10:10:12 PM] Steve: http://www.barstoolsports.com/newyork/jerry-seinfeld-absolutely-stifles-kesha-from-giving-him-a-hug/
[6/6/17, 10:13:54 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/sLnuBQDcbD4
[6/7/17, 8:11:10 AM] Miller: Since 2000, the median age of wrestling viewers has gone up 26 years.
In 2000, the median age of a pro wrestling viewer was 28. Now it‚Äôs 54
[6/7/17, 8:11:13 AM] Miller: interdasting
[6/7/17, 8:11:42 AM] Miller: probably doesnt bode well for the LT success of WWE but also makes sense why they keep dragging these guys out of retirement
[6/7/17, 8:19:32 AM] Kiyoon: Maybe they need to get icons instead of these jabronis nowadays and get the youngns hooked
[6/7/17, 8:20:27 AM] Miller: millenials too busy eating avocado toast not buying homes and not having healthcare to watch wrestling
[6/7/17, 8:20:29 AM] Kiyoon: Although, when I went to raw the last two times in DC I'd say the average age was like 10 to 15
[6/7/17, 8:22:13 AM] Steve: Raw? Always smackdown. Or do they not have that anymore?
[6/7/17, 8:48:00 AM] Brian Katz: Smackdowns the better show at this point
[6/7/17, 8:48:17 AM] Steve: Always has been
[6/7/17, 8:48:24 AM] Steve: Even when I was watching wrestling
[6/7/17, 8:48:30 AM] Steve: That was my thanksgiving ritual
[6/7/17, 8:48:34 AM] Brian Katz: I went to raw in April, and I thought there were plenty of kids
[6/7/17, 8:48:54 AM] Scott: how is wrestling live?
[6/7/17, 8:48:57 AM] Scott: never been
[6/7/17, 8:49:17 AM] Brian Katz: It's great
[6/7/17, 8:50:05 AM] Miller: last (only) live event i went to was WMX @ MSG
[6/7/17, 8:50:06 AM] Miller: was sick
[6/7/17, 8:50:13 AM] Miller: razor vs HBK ladder match
[6/7/17, 8:51:02 AM] Miller: technically also went to the stars and stripes yokozuna bodyslam challenge on the USS Intrepid (but not quite a live arena event)
[6/7/17, 8:51:58 AM] Brian Katz: Seeing these guys do these stunts live, you get a new appreciation for what they do
[6/7/17, 8:52:30 AM] Brian Katz: Didn't Luger slam that Bitch
[6/7/17, 8:53:07 AM] Miller: oh yea
[6/7/17, 8:53:15 AM] Miller: showed up in a helicopter
[6/7/17, 8:53:19 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[6/7/17, 8:54:33 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v-vSfCAF0Y
[6/7/17, 8:54:57 AM] Brian Katz: Can you imagine that, knowing that when you woke up that morning, you'd be helicoptered in to  a aircraft carrier to body slam a 600lb Samoan in front of 1000's of people. So cool lol
[6/7/17, 8:56:25 AM] Miller: everyone there thought it was hogan gonna be getting out of the copter
[6/7/17, 10:09:59 AM] Miller: our "sister" fund has an intern (who is supposed to be here at 830) and is not here and their PM just asked where he was and apparently has been coming in ~1030 and nobody has really noticed/said anything
[6/7/17, 10:10:00 AM] Miller: so good
[6/7/17, 10:10:52 AM] Dan Watts: Avocado toast so good
[6/7/17, 10:11:55 AM] Miller: ive never had it (or been to brunch which i assume go hand in hand)
[6/7/17, 10:13:48 AM] Donk: i mean, you have had toast and avocados before
[6/7/17, 10:13:53 AM] Donk: its pretty straight forward
[6/7/17, 10:14:02 AM] Miller: im not sure ive ever had avocado in non-guacamole form
[6/7/17, 10:14:18 AM] Donk: (fwiw, ive never had it at brunch, but have made it myself)
[6/7/17, 10:14:33 AM] Donk: how is that possible? you have never had just straight avocado on a burger or sandwich?
[6/7/17, 10:14:40 AM] Miller: not that i can recall
[6/7/17, 10:15:16 AM] Steve: That's crazy
[6/7/17, 10:15:24 AM] Steve: Avocado just makes everything better
[6/7/17, 10:15:25 AM] Dan Watts: That's an avocado toast I had a couple weeks ago
[6/7/17, 10:15:25 AM] Donk: pretty impressive if you have made it 33 years without eating avocado straight up
[6/7/17, 10:15:27 AM] Steve: Including toast
[6/7/17, 10:15:32 AM] Dan Watts: Stay bad and bougee
[6/7/17, 10:15:45 AM] Steve: This is the same guy that hates mayo
[6/7/17, 10:15:50 AM] Miller: i made it like 28 years w/o even eating guac
[6/7/17, 10:15:52 AM] Steve: So his food palate makes little sense
[6/7/17, 10:16:00 AM] Miller: mayo is disgusting and lots of ppl hate it
[6/7/17, 10:16:09 AM] Steve: Lots of people hate avocado
[6/7/17, 10:16:15 AM] Steve: Still doesn't mean it's not delicious
[6/7/17, 10:16:28 AM] Steve: More likely those people just aren't #woke
[6/7/17, 10:16:42 AM] Miller: question for the avocado on burger people are these usually burgers you make yourself or get at restaurants?
[6/7/17, 10:16:54 AM] Steve: Either, or
[6/7/17, 10:16:54 AM] Donk: both?
[6/7/17, 10:17:05 AM] Steve: I have also made avocado burgers at home
[6/7/17, 10:17:12 AM] Steve: I mean, I've grilled pizza
[6/7/17, 10:17:21 AM] Steve: Not much I wouldn't add to the grill
[6/7/17, 10:17:31 AM] Donk: in fact i had avocado on a grilled chicken sandwich i ate last night for dinner
[6/7/17, 10:17:55 AM] Steve: This is something donk and I can really get behind together
[6/7/17, 10:18:02 AM] Miller: well ive never bought an avocado so never would have had it on a burger i made myself
[6/7/17, 10:18:12 AM] Steve: Damn shame
[6/7/17, 10:18:25 AM] Steve: Also if you bought an avocado, it might end up like this
[6/7/17, 10:18:40 AM] Miller: and idk not something i ever think about adding to a burger at a restaurant, seems like it would only be an option at fancier places whereas most of my burger eating is done at bars or fast casual places
[6/7/17, 10:18:52 AM] Kiyoon: yeah you need to be a bit experienced with avacado otherwise you'll mess up
[6/7/17, 10:18:56 AM] Miller: now im gonna go out of my way to try it
[6/7/17, 10:19:06 AM] Steve: http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/avocados-should-carry-a-warning-after-increase-in-hand-injuries/ar-BBAYSCO
[6/7/17, 10:19:20 AM] Steve: Is bareburger fancy?
[6/7/17, 10:19:26 AM] Miller: kind of yea
[6/7/17, 10:19:32 AM] Steve: Not st all
[6/7/17, 10:19:35 AM] Steve: *at
[6/7/17, 10:19:36 AM] Donk: yeah i would bare burger is fancy
[6/7/17, 10:19:39 AM] Miller: they have their own organic ketchup
[6/7/17, 10:19:48 AM] Donk: smashburger/five guys/etc would be fast casual
[6/7/17, 10:19:49 AM] Steve: They give you tap water in a milk bottle lol
[6/7/17, 10:19:50 AM] Miller: and non GMO organic elk burgers
[6/7/17, 10:19:53 AM] Scott: bareburger is a bit fancy
[6/7/17, 10:19:56 AM] Donk: but smash burger has avocados
[6/7/17, 10:19:59 AM] Scott: they have wild boar and ostrich
[6/7/17, 10:20:00 AM] Steve: They are just organic
[6/7/17, 10:20:02 AM] Miller: and a burger and fries is like $30 there
[6/7/17, 10:20:05 AM] Steve: That's not necessarily fancy
[6/7/17, 10:20:12 AM] Scott: its fancy
[6/7/17, 10:20:13 AM] Steve: It's like $15
[6/7/17, 10:20:15 AM] Dan Watts: I had bare burger last week
[6/7/17, 10:20:17 AM] Miller: its hipster and expensive
[6/7/17, 10:20:20 AM] Dan Watts: It's bad and bougee
[6/7/17, 10:20:22 AM] Steve: I went three weeks ago
[6/7/17, 10:20:24 AM] Donk: love me some bareburger
[6/7/17, 10:20:31 AM] Steve: It's slightly hipster
[6/7/17, 10:20:35 AM] Steve: But def not fancy
[6/7/17, 10:20:38 AM] Miller: slightly?!
[6/7/17, 10:20:40 AM] Donk: their fried chicken sandwichs are mad good on the low
[6/7/17, 10:20:44 AM] Dan Watts: Onion rings were on fleek
[6/7/17, 10:20:44 AM] Miller: i rest my casd
[6/7/17, 10:20:47 AM] Miller: *case
[6/7/17, 10:20:47 AM] Donk: super hipster
[6/7/17, 10:20:49 AM] Steve: Since when do people think hipster=fancy? Lol
[6/7/17, 10:20:59 AM] Donk: its not, but bareburger is both
[6/7/17, 10:21:01 AM] Steve: So no when we go to Brooklyn
[6/7/17, 10:21:05 AM] Steve: We are being fancy
[6/7/17, 10:21:23 AM] Steve: Slightly was clearly a understatement
[6/7/17, 10:21:25 AM] Miller: i love smashburger, might try some avocado there
[6/7/17, 10:21:30 AM] Steve: But it is not fancy in any way
[6/7/17, 10:21:38 AM] Steve: They give you paper napkins lol
[6/7/17, 10:21:48 AM] Steve: And have a condiment basket lol
[6/7/17, 10:21:52 AM] Donk: i dont care for the burgers at smashburger, but really enjoy their grilled chicken sandwiches
[6/7/17, 10:22:03 AM] Steve: Literally not fancy at all
[6/7/17, 10:22:12 AM] Steve: Hipster, I'll agree 100%
[6/7/17, 10:22:16 AM] Steve: Not fancy
[6/7/17, 10:22:47 AM] Steve: Miller to prove a point, sends a trip advisor rating
[6/7/17, 10:22:57 AM] Scott: what do u consider fancy steve?
[6/7/17, 10:23:06 AM] Steve: A fancy burger place?
[6/7/17, 10:23:12 AM] Steve: Some place that has glassware
[6/7/17, 10:23:17 AM] Miller: the rating was not the relevant part of that
[6/7/17, 10:23:18 AM] Steve: And cloth napkins
[6/7/17, 10:23:31 AM] Steve: And that doesn't give you water in a plastic shot glass
[6/7/17, 10:23:33 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/7/17, 10:23:47 AM] Steve: That's fancy
[6/7/17, 10:23:48 AM] Donk: they have real glasses lol, at least at the bareburger i go to
[6/7/17, 10:23:58 AM] Steve: They have real glasses when you order drinks
[6/7/17, 10:24:03 AM] Steve: Not when it's non alcoholic
[6/7/17, 10:24:06 AM] Donk: even for the water
[6/7/17, 10:24:10 AM] Steve: They serve you in hard plastic cups
[6/7/17, 10:24:11 AM] Miller: when i use the word fancy in this context i mean it more in the sense of being expensive for what it is
[6/7/17, 10:24:15 AM] Donk: at least at the one it hartsdale
[6/7/17, 10:24:21 AM] Donk: in hartsdale
[6/7/17, 10:24:25 AM] Steve: Bothbin astoria
[6/7/17, 10:24:38 AM] Steve: Which is where it first started serve you water and soda in hard plastic cups
[6/7/17, 10:24:58 AM] Donk: thats queens though, what do you expect?
[6/7/17, 10:25:07 AM] Steve: It's actually Long Island
[6/7/17, 10:25:12 AM] Donk: lol
[6/7/17, 10:25:15 AM] Steve: According to @16318489683
[6/7/17, 10:25:24 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zpOMYRi0w bareburger anthem
[6/7/17, 10:25:44 AM] Steve: When someone calls a place fancy, I actually thought it meant fancy
[6/7/17, 10:25:48 AM] Steve: Not just expensive
[6/7/17, 10:26:20 AM] Steve: We have a ton of healthy places by me that are not fancy but still expensive
[6/7/17, 10:26:26 AM] Steve: One example, create
[6/7/17, 10:26:37 AM] Steve: That shit is hipster and expensive but not fancy
[6/7/17, 10:28:00 AM] Miller: are you using an iphone 3?
[6/7/17, 10:28:27 AM] Steve: Also, you should really eat them before they look like that
[6/7/17, 10:28:32 AM] Donk: also, who cut that avocado? looks mangled
[6/7/17, 10:29:01 AM] Miller: heres a 2mp picture of an old mangled avocado
[6/7/17, 10:29:05 AM] Miller: looks awesome
[6/7/17, 10:29:08 AM] Miller: cant wait to try this
[6/7/17, 10:29:21 AM] Steve: Don't worry @15166335046
[6/7/17, 10:29:24 AM] Justin: It's funny because I bought and cut one for the first time other day
[6/7/17, 10:29:29 AM] Steve: I'll take you it to a fancy dinner at bareburger
[6/7/17, 10:29:44 AM] Steve: Where the avocados are not touched by mangle hands Herman
[6/7/17, 10:30:14 AM] Miller: he mangled some burgers the other day
[6/7/17, 10:30:28 AM] Steve: He should not be allowed near a grill really
[6/7/17, 10:30:43 AM] Steve: Didn't he burn everyone's food last summer?
[6/7/17, 10:30:50 AM] Steve: Or was that Feinberg?
[6/7/17, 10:31:25 AM] Miller: i think he burnt some food this time also, i forget how those hot dogs got like that
[6/7/17, 10:32:18 AM] Steve: Let's start the keep @16316620763 away from all grills movement
[6/7/17, 10:32:39 AM] Justin: Grilling game is on point
[6/7/17, 10:32:42 AM] Miller: i cant co-sign that, i was tired from all my pizza making and was happy to have anyone else grill
[6/7/17, 10:33:01 AM] Steve: Side note, I'm going to do a BBQ next weekend. If anyone wants to come out you are welcome.
[6/7/17, 10:33:29 AM] Steve: I'll have more details early next week
[6/7/17, 10:33:36 AM] Steve: It would be Saturday afternoon
[6/7/17, 10:33:48 AM] Justin: May require personal invite
[6/7/17, 10:33:58 AM] Steve: Well I'm not doing that so...
[6/7/17, 10:34:30 AM] Steve: Two guarantees, @16316620763 will not touch the food and their will be avocado.
[6/7/17, 10:34:46 AM] Launchpad: üëèüëèüëè  You guys finally got avocados in NY ü•ëü•ëü•ë
[6/7/17, 10:34:56 AM] Steve: We've always had them
[6/7/17, 10:35:26 AM] Justin: We still have yet to combine avocado and taco Tuesday
[6/7/17, 10:35:45 AM] Launchpad: avocado is a taco tuesday staple
[6/7/17, 10:35:47 AM] Justin: Steve is actively trying
[6/7/17, 10:35:50 AM] Steve: Well if you eat guacamole before your tacos you've also done that
[6/7/17, 10:36:21 AM] Miller: or on your tacos
[6/7/17, 10:37:52 AM] Miller: hes going to business school now?
[6/7/17, 10:38:08 AM] Donk: what does transitioning mean?
[6/7/17, 10:38:09 AM] Launchpad: yup he sent me a request too
[6/7/17, 10:38:14 AM] Miller: thought the whole point of this seal thing was b/c he had some sick pvt sector jobs post-navy
[6/7/17, 10:38:17 AM] Launchpad: lol
[6/7/17, 10:38:23 AM] Steve: His service is probably ending
[6/7/17, 10:38:35 AM] Launchpad: no thats not the point of the seals
[6/7/17, 10:38:41 AM] Kiyoon: Steve remember how mad he got when you kept singing "In the NAVY!"
[6/7/17, 10:38:48 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/7/17, 10:38:49 AM] Steve: Yea
[6/7/17, 10:38:59 AM] Steve: Good times
[6/7/17, 10:39:04 AM] Miller: i meant his reasoning not everyones reasoning in general
[6/7/17, 10:39:19 AM] Miller: considering that was literally what he told me last time i talked to him, i have no reason to believe he was lying to me
[6/7/17, 10:39:32 AM] Kiyoon: #fakenews
[6/7/17, 10:39:48 AM] Launchpad: #socialengineering
[6/7/17, 10:40:11 AM] Miller: apparently, sounded like a pretty shitty situation b/c you had to go live in these pretty shitty countries to do that work but he said you made awesome $ and was pretty low risk stuff
[6/7/17, 10:40:45 AM] Miller: but hey i guess wasting 10yrs of your life to go take out 200k in debt for business school at 30 is cool also
[6/7/17, 10:40:52 AM] Steve: Guess that means he's going to live in New York now
[6/7/17, 10:41:11 AM] Steve: The military will pay for some of it
[6/7/17, 10:41:44 AM] Steve: Pretty sure that's one of it's bigger benefits
[6/7/17, 10:41:48 AM] Steve: Just don't know how much
[6/7/17, 10:41:54 AM] Kiyoon: I thought he was making bank off properties cause of his low interest rate
[6/7/17, 10:41:56 AM] Kiyoon: he gets
[6/7/17, 10:42:08 AM] Launchpad: I think you also avoid taxes while you're making awesome money in shitty countries
[6/7/17, 10:42:13 AM] Miller: kiyoon you looked at interest rates the last 10 years?
[6/7/17, 10:42:19 AM] Miller: everyone gets low interest rates
[6/7/17, 10:42:33 AM] Kiyoon: true, maybe he got some sort of break
[6/7/17, 10:42:44 AM] Kiyoon: I dno I was told from maybe Scotty or Wild dan he owned liek 6 properties
[6/7/17, 10:43:09 AM] Launchpad: wild dan -- seeing as he was his accountant
[6/7/17, 10:43:09 AM] Miller: with all that navy seal money?
[6/7/17, 10:43:21 AM] Miller: i mean i guess anyone can take out 6 mortgages in theory
[6/7/17, 10:43:45 AM] Miller: doesnt really make a lot of sense, nothing inherently seal-esque that translates into RE investing or property mgmt
[6/7/17, 10:44:00 AM] Steve: Also depending on his gmat score and gpa he could get money off that way
[6/7/17, 10:44:09 AM] Steve: No real way to know how much he pays out of pocket
[6/7/17, 10:44:09 AM] Launchpad: maybe he made some bitcoin on the side
[6/7/17, 10:45:15 AM] Launchpad: Maybe he actually killed Osama bin Laden and wrote a book about it under a pseudonym
[6/7/17, 10:45:39 AM] Miller: maybe he paid 10k to be in the movie lone survivor
[6/7/17, 10:45:42 AM] Miller: no wait that was someone else
[6/7/17, 10:46:12 AM] Kiyoon: hahah I saw that movie like a week ago and saw him in it
[6/7/17, 10:46:16 AM] Kiyoon: thought how mad you would be
[6/7/17, 10:46:23 AM] Scott: I spoke to Adam a couple days ago  we are meeting up when he moves to the city
[6/7/17, 10:47:11 AM] Kiyoon: lol Cheese out of left field
[6/7/17, 10:47:13 AM] Miller: you gonna hire him for security from your gf's bf?
[6/7/17, 10:47:13 AM] Launchpad: Johnny Drama?
[6/7/17, 10:47:36 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/7/17, 10:49:20 AM] Steve: Cheese is going to represent him in exchange for security
[6/7/17, 10:49:38 AM] Donk: and a beer
[6/7/17, 10:53:52 AM] Miller: update - they called the intern, he is apparently sick w/food poisoning (aka hungover)
[6/7/17, 10:54:12 AM] Miller: b/c everyone knows the right thing to do when you are sick and cant make it to work is not tell anyone and hope nobody notices
[6/7/17, 10:54:15 AM] Kiyoon: lol since he never called in in the morning
[6/7/17, 10:54:29 AM] Miller: #kidsthesedays
[6/7/17, 10:54:36 AM] Steve: I mean, nobody noticed he's been coming in late so is that a bad assumption?
[6/7/17, 11:07:16 AM] Launchpad: if you're an intern and you have a dick, you may as well just stay home
[6/7/17, 11:07:28 AM] Launchpad: no one wants to talk to you anyway
[6/7/17, 11:13:49 AM] Miller: sage advice
[6/7/17, 11:14:13 AM] Miller: i started out as an intern and best believe i was the 1st person and last person to leave
[6/7/17, 11:14:20 AM] Miller: ive gotten much lazier in my old age
[6/7/17, 11:14:46 AM] Launchpad: I am one of the first in the office...and one of the first out of the office
[6/7/17, 11:27:03 AM] Steve: We all don
[6/7/17, 11:27:05 AM] Steve: *do
[6/7/17, 11:27:12 AM] Steve: But that's what being an intern is
[6/7/17, 11:27:17 AM] Steve: It humbles you
[6/7/17, 11:27:36 AM] Steve: Gives you a respect for hard work and it's payoff
[6/7/17, 11:31:49 AM] Launchpad: cheese are you going to Austin or do you have too much homework?
[6/7/17, 11:40:11 AM] Miller: reverse hall pass
[6/7/17, 11:57:15 AM] Miller: *UBER LOSES RENEWED BID TO PAUSE WAYMO TRADE SECRET LAWSUIT
[6/7/17, 11:57:24 AM] Miller: too bad the uber lawyer didnt have hip replacement surgery
[6/7/17, 1:08:29 PM] Justin: not to start this back up again, but almost noone thinks like that....just saying
[6/7/17, 1:08:33 PM] Brian Katz: What movie is that from
[6/7/17, 1:08:45 PM] Justin: not really sure
[6/7/17, 1:10:49 PM] Brian Katz: Well one person does for sure.
[6/7/17, 1:13:13 PM] Justin: lol...like i told you on facebook go pick up atlas shrugged already
[6/7/17, 1:13:22 PM] Justin: it will help fully convert you to the darksdie
[6/7/17, 1:14:13 PM] Justin: wont give you an actual understanding of the context in which the term privilege is used, but hey that's futile at this point
[6/7/17, 1:21:39 PM] Justin: and that cartoon is actually closer to proving the opposite point of the intended.  Clearly the absurdity of that womens statement, as you see it, is that noone will give a fuck or be disincentive to earn money because of fear of their children being privileged.  Just like noone will give a fuck or be disincentivized to become rich because of government redistribution
[6/7/17, 1:47:52 PM] Justin: @16195657200  https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/06/07/bitcoin-is-at-an-all-time-high-but-is-it-about-to-self-destruct/#60abc0acb31b    funny was just reading about people making these complaints on my poker forum
[6/7/17, 1:49:20 PM] Launchpad: A Clockwork Orange
[6/7/17, 1:49:29 PM] Launchpad: awesome movie
[6/7/17, 1:49:44 PM] Justin: no way thats clockwork orange..looks too recent in terms of cinematography
[6/7/17, 1:50:57 PM] Launchpad: oh shit youre right
[6/7/17, 1:50:59 PM] Launchpad: it might be Ash vs Evil Dead
[6/7/17, 1:52:33 PM] Justin: im thinking some kind of alien movie.....
[6/7/17, 1:52:48 PM] Justin: faculty maybe?
[6/7/17, 1:53:17 PM] Justin: google isnt helping
[6/7/17, 1:53:54 PM] Miller: Ash vs Evil Dead
[6/7/17, 1:53:59 PM] Miller: your google skills are embarassing
[6/7/17, 1:54:14 PM] Launchpad: its the villian from season 2
[6/7/17, 1:55:08 PM] Miller: damn mystery looking rough
[6/7/17, 1:55:43 PM] Launchpad: what can you expect from him, he was born poor, uneducated, and without privilege so he has no chance of ever learning how to google
[6/7/17, 1:56:41 PM] Launchpad: great show by the way....anyone else watch it?
[6/7/17, 1:57:14 PM] Justin: still cant find it on google lol
[6/7/17, 1:58:04 PM] Miller: ppl like you the reason the show catfish still exists
[6/7/17, 1:58:56 PM] Justin: im gonna bet 1/2 group cant ifnd it on google
[6/7/17, 1:59:06 PM] Justin: steve doesnt count becuase he will say he can no matter what
[6/7/17, 2:00:04 PM] Justin: did just realzie it says stars on bottom right
[6/7/17, 2:00:07 PM] Miller: 1/2 being generous
[6/7/17, 2:01:18 PM] Launchpad: its the same argument thats been around for years, and here we are at $3000
[6/7/17, 2:01:23 PM] Justin: i treid copy pasting the video into google...even inspected the video code itself, googled fingernail to eye scene
[6/7/17, 2:11:14 PM] Steve: I can what?
[6/7/17, 2:11:21 PM] Steve: Keep my name out your mouth
[6/7/17, 2:12:42 PM] Justin: stricken form the record
[6/7/17, 2:13:33 PM] Steve: What are you saying?
[6/7/17, 3:05:32 PM] Justin: https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily/videos/1573181466066813/
[6/7/17, 3:07:37 PM] Launchpad: theres nothing elite about Elite Daily
[6/7/17, 3:09:25 PM] Justin: is there anything daily about it?
[6/7/17, 3:11:42 PM] Launchpad: daily noise
[6/7/17, 3:12:40 PM] Dan Watts: @16316620763 of course women will take no responsibility for something like this and blame men for being opressors
[6/7/17, 3:13:01 PM] Steve: Ok ok ok, hold on
[6/7/17, 3:13:34 PM] Steve: Is the sentiment here that women blame men for being oppressors for anything and everything?
[6/7/17, 3:13:39 PM] Steve: Or just in this case?
[6/7/17, 3:13:41 PM] Justin: i think there are shitty women and shitty men.  If someone is dumb enough to excuse shitty behavior on base of gender, thats stupid
[6/7/17, 3:13:55 PM] Steve: ^agreed
[6/7/17, 3:14:04 PM] Launchpad: You mean its not just all or nothing ü§î
[6/7/17, 3:14:27 PM] Justin: that sounds pretty all or othing to me
[6/7/17, 3:14:40 PM] Justin: statement cant get any more black and white
[6/7/17, 3:16:53 PM] Justin: getting back at privilege, if you attempted to argue we cant change it, or attempting to change it makes things worse ....then we are entering an argument where both sides present facts, and we can both have our opinions.  Claiming it doesn't exist is just stupid and as you call it " all or nothing thinking"
[6/7/17, 3:20:56 PM] Launchpad: We're all pretty privileged not to be born in North Korea
[6/7/17, 3:21:14 PM] Launchpad: can we talk about what we can do to help the North Koreans?
[6/7/17, 3:21:20 PM] Launchpad: Kiyoon, do you have any suggestions?
[6/7/17, 3:22:08 PM] Justin: you live in a strawman universe
[6/7/17, 3:22:12 PM] Kiyoon: yeah, drop a bomb on kim jong un
[6/7/17, 3:22:20 PM] Justin: ltierally anecdotal experience and strawman are 99% of your arguments
[6/7/17, 3:23:12 PM] Launchpad: conversely, talking about privilege basically amounts to whining, bitching, complaining and moaning that life isn't fair
[6/7/17, 3:23:49 PM] Justin: can be said about 99% of things
[6/7/17, 3:23:53 PM] Launchpad: you can make the most of your life or you can blame your parents for sucking
[6/7/17, 3:24:00 PM] Justin: talking about politics  basically amounts to whining, bitching, complaining and moaning that life isn't fair
[6/7/17, 3:24:03 PM] Justin: tlaking abotu sports  basically amounts to whining, bitching, complaining and moaning that life isn't fair
[6/7/17, 3:24:08 PM] Justin: talking about balding  basically amounts to whining, bitching, complaining and moaning that life isn't fair
[6/7/17, 3:24:11 PM] Justin: tlaking about life  basically amounts to whining, bitching, complaining and moaning that life isn't fair
[6/7/17, 3:24:23 PM] Launchpad: I have never complained about being bald
[6/7/17, 3:24:29 PM] Launchpad: Proud
[6/7/17, 3:24:33 PM] Justin: when did i complain about being white?
[6/7/17, 3:24:48 PM] Justin: please find it...ill eagerly await
[6/7/17, 3:24:59 PM] Launchpad: you complain that other white people wont admit they're special snowflakes
[6/7/17, 3:25:01 PM] Justin: man it sucks im white
[6/7/17, 3:25:26 PM] Justin: well i complain people who use the term snowflake are likeliest to be offended when called a snowflake....sure
[6/7/17, 3:26:31 PM] Launchpad: Once we're done admitting privilege exists, then what?
[6/7/17, 3:26:38 PM] Launchpad: Do we march on Washington?
[6/7/17, 3:26:52 PM] Justin: well the argument becomes can something be done about it
[6/7/17, 3:26:55 PM] Justin: surely you would argue no
[6/7/17, 3:26:59 PM] Justin: i would argue yes
[6/7/17, 3:27:33 PM] Justin: i'd still think you were wrong, you would still think I was wrong, but at least we would be in the right ballpark
[6/7/17, 3:27:47 PM] Justin: its like saying racism doesnt exist, or i dont see color
[6/7/17, 3:27:50 PM] Launchpad: I would argue that yes, there can be something done about it, and it goes something like this:  
"Suck it up buttercup.  Read a fucken book, aquire skills, be useful to society"
[6/7/17, 3:27:57 PM] Steve: Yea, it leads to conversation on how we can change it
[6/7/17, 3:28:16 PM] Steve: How we can see things from other people's point of view hat aren't white males
[6/7/17, 3:28:18 PM] Justin: ^that
[6/7/17, 3:28:35 PM] Justin: still i say most likely leads to just more whining and bitching
[6/7/17, 3:28:46 PM] Steve: That's a very shortsighted, ignorant take
[6/7/17, 3:30:05 PM] Launchpad: how can we fix privilege?
[6/7/17, 3:30:14 PM] Justin: its essentailly an economic argument at its heart.  Supply side fails over and over again in reality, so i would have facts to back up my argument.  If you take an educated supply side argument, you would talk from the theoretical side about perversion of incentives and inevitable creation of monopolies by force(ala the government)
[6/7/17, 3:30:23 PM] Launchpad: should we stop millionaires from having kids?
[6/7/17, 3:30:31 PM] Justin: strawmannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
[6/7/17, 3:30:38 PM] Justin: i say we kill all white people
[6/7/17, 3:30:43 PM] Justin: that would do it
[6/7/17, 3:30:56 PM] Launchpad: you first...
[6/7/17, 3:31:17 PM] Justin: could stop poor people form having kids
[6/7/17, 3:31:25 PM] Justin: probably a better example
[6/7/17, 3:31:38 PM] Justin: which is the point of access to health care clinics and sex education
[6/7/17, 3:31:52 PM] Donk: we should really stop all people from having kids, too many people on this planet already
[6/7/17, 3:32:06 PM] Justin: so there is one way, we decrease young brithrate in minority communities
[6/7/17, 3:32:17 PM] Donk: or at least limit people to 1-2 kids per couple for a long time
[6/7/17, 3:32:29 PM] Justin: so you see even in your beyond stupid example you sparked a liberal talking point
[6/7/17, 3:32:49 PM] Justin: well rpoblem is you would do that with tax disincntives
[6/7/17, 3:32:56 PM] Justin: and poor people dont pay taxes
[6/7/17, 3:33:18 PM] Justin: and if you did it by charging poor people, now you are charging people who have a young child money they cant afford
[6/7/17, 3:33:29 PM] Donk: or you do it by forced abortions for anyone who gets pregnant beyond the 2nd kid, but that oculd get bloody
[6/7/17, 3:33:46 PM] Justin: yeh thats intrusive and i jump on LP freedom side
[6/7/17, 3:33:52 PM] Justin: see how this works LP
[6/7/17, 3:34:10 PM] Donk: haha, i dont actually think its a good idea to have forced abortions
[6/7/17, 3:34:16 PM] Justin: we're not trying to solve the worlds problems here, but we can discuss them
[6/7/17, 3:34:35 PM] Justin: yeh i dont know if there is an easy answer other than sex education
[6/7/17, 3:34:39 PM] Donk: but you could make the financial penalties super significant, would really be the only way
[6/7/17, 3:34:44 PM] Justin: and access to abortions etc
[6/7/17, 3:35:04 PM] Justin: but that would be crushing to a 14 yr old who we want to get out of poverty
[6/7/17, 3:35:21 PM] Donk: well presumably that 14 year just had their first child and not their 3rd
[6/7/17, 3:35:24 PM] Justin: also highlights conservative argument that welfare is titty milk to the poor
[6/7/17, 3:35:30 PM] Donk: which is where the penalties would begin
[6/7/17, 3:35:47 PM] Justin: and creates perversion of incentive to work
[6/7/17, 4:05:24 PM] Launchpad: sure we can talk about it -- but what can the average white person do?
[6/7/17, 4:05:40 PM] Launchpad: what can I do? Will it ever be enough?
[6/7/17, 4:07:09 PM] Launchpad: should I feel guilty about myself?
[6/7/17, 4:07:13 PM] Donk: well the first thing you could is stop crying that white privilege doesn't exist anytime someone even mentions it
[6/7/17, 4:07:55 PM] Launchpad: But why is it only "White" privilege
[6/7/17, 4:08:07 PM] Donk: sigh
[6/7/17, 4:08:51 PM] Launchpad: you can *sigh all you want
[6/7/17, 4:09:31 PM] Donk: its ok, there is a reason why i havent gotten involved in any of these discussions with you on it the last couple of weeks/months, i know you are a hopeless cause at this point
[6/7/17, 4:09:54 PM] Launchpad: the funny thing is that whenever I bring up the fact that singling me out based on my race & socioeconomic status is offensive, I'm told to 'deal with it, snowflake'
[6/7/17, 4:10:29 PM] Donk: see, that is the main issue. anytime some mentions white privildge, you take as a personal insult
[6/7/17, 4:10:32 PM] Launchpad: when you use words to shame or invoke guilt in how someone is born, its offensive
[6/7/17, 4:10:36 PM] Donk: so yes, you are a snowflake
[6/7/17, 4:11:26 PM] Launchpad: so if you offend me, why should I help your cause and be a part of your forced abortion discussion?
[6/7/17, 4:11:44 PM] Donk: ha, the abortion thing is a totally different discussion
[6/7/17, 4:12:08 PM] Donk: i favor population control from a purely enviromental standpoint, has nothing to do with race or privelidge
[6/7/17, 4:13:20 PM] Donk: (and by offend you, what you mean is that anyone mentions that white people, especially white males, have a leg up in getting ahead in society, you take that as a personal insult)
[6/7/17, 4:13:28 PM] Donk: (which you shouldnt)
[6/7/17, 4:14:31 PM] Steve: I've agreed with donk a ton today
[6/7/17, 4:14:41 PM] Steve: Donk, did we just become best friends?
[6/7/17, 4:18:52 PM] Donk: strange things are afoot at the circle k
[6/7/17, 4:34:55 PM] Dan Watts: what happened to this guy Bret Weinstein a very liberal professor at Evergreen State College is the real problem with this assertion of white privilige. At ESC they have a designated "day of absense" where students of color are not required to go to school. the effect is to show the importance of minorities on campus while they aren't there.  ESC changed day of absense this year to BAN whites from campus in the name of white privilege.  This is the most distorted racist bullshit ever.
[6/7/17, 4:35:31 PM] Dan Watts: He refused to be acknowledge ban and now is being labeled a racist and a bigot and an alt-righter and hes none of those thigns
[6/7/17, 4:36:20 PM] Launchpad: and protestors are walking around campus with baseball bats
[6/7/17, 4:36:47 PM] Dan Watts: yes
[6/7/17, 4:37:16 PM] Dan Watts: and they trapped the president of the school and wouldn't let him go to the bathroom unless a student escorted him
[6/7/17, 4:37:49 PM] Dan Watts: but you know what these guys are just snowflakes
[6/7/17, 4:38:07 PM] Dan Watts: fuck that i'm tired of hearing this bullshit
[6/7/17, 4:38:56 PM] Donk: ok, i agree that this is bullshit
[6/7/17, 4:39:05 PM] Donk: to me thats a classic example of exclusion
[6/7/17, 4:39:20 PM] Donk: when if anything people need to come together to discuss these things, not divide them now
[6/7/17, 4:40:02 PM] Donk: however, this is no way shows that white privilige doesnt exist
[6/7/17, 4:41:53 PM] Dan Watts: you can't tell me a white redneck in west virginia with no education has white privilege
[6/7/17, 4:42:11 PM] Launchpad: People are not going to come together when you use words that offend them (snowflake) and tell them to get over themselves
[6/7/17, 4:42:14 PM] Launchpad: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Snowflake&utm_source=search-action
[6/7/17, 4:43:14 PM] Launchpad: But the ARYANS succeeded in poisoning the well on calling people "snowflakes," when it became widely understood that they were using it as a euphemism for the human ashes falling in Nazi Germany when they were burning people.
[6/7/17, 4:43:50 PM] Donk: once again, its not about specific examples
[6/7/17, 4:43:58 PM] Dan Watts: why not?
[6/7/17, 4:44:17 PM] Donk: and launchpad, no one called you a snowflake until you cried about it not exisiting and being upset about the entire idea in general
[6/7/17, 4:44:22 PM] Dan Watts: you can't say "white privilege" and say well it doesn't apply to a substantial segment of the population
[6/7/17, 4:44:30 PM] Donk: i never said that
[6/7/17, 4:44:36 PM] Donk: it applies to society as a whole
[6/7/17, 4:45:08 PM] Justin: you are right not onyl is there privledge there is also ecnomic discrimination
[6/7/17, 4:45:19 PM] Justin: poorer people have lower outcomes as well
[6/7/17, 4:45:35 PM] Justin: white poor people's childrne have it rough as well
[6/7/17, 4:45:42 PM] Donk: and that white redneck in west Virginia still has that privilege in comparison to the black redneck in west Virginia
[6/7/17, 4:45:47 PM] Launchpad: the best way to get over racism is by stereotyping large segments of the population
[6/7/17, 4:46:12 PM] Dan Watts: i'll concede socio-economic discrimination, but i cannot concede privilege based on race
[6/7/17, 4:46:25 PM] Donk: well then you are wrong
[6/7/17, 4:46:43 PM] Justin: really?
[6/7/17, 4:46:48 PM] Justin: thats insane to me
[6/7/17, 4:46:51 PM] Donk: how about all of the statistics that show that black people get longer prison sentences that white people who commit the same crimes?
[6/7/17, 4:46:58 PM] Justin: i eman its hard to distinguish the two sometimes
[6/7/17, 4:47:09 PM] Launchpad: and that black redneck in west virginia still has privilege over the north korean, therefore he has no right to complain and he should stop being a snowflake
[6/7/17, 4:47:35 PM] Dan Watts: Studies are misleading- and often compare sentences in different states with different laws
[6/7/17, 4:47:45 PM] Justin: once again pirlvisge  is there to explain unequal outcomes
[6/7/17, 4:47:56 PM] Justin: its not tehre to use as an example of why someone cant complain
[6/7/17, 4:48:01 PM] Justin: idk where the fuck you get this idea
[6/7/17, 4:48:01 PM] Dan Watts: How many athletes of color get off scott free?
[6/7/17, 4:48:12 PM] Donk: we are veering into fake news territory
[6/7/17, 4:48:16 PM] Donk: facts are wrong
[6/7/17, 4:48:21 PM] Donk: opinions are what matter
[6/7/17, 4:48:25 PM] Justin: yeh come on watts ill get you drug use rates and prison rates
[6/7/17, 4:48:39 PM] Justin: yoyu get me college student athletes getting off of "scott free"
[6/7/17, 4:49:05 PM] Justin: not to mention do white colelge student sget off "scott free"
[6/7/17, 4:49:07 PM] Dan Watts: well if theres white privilege, only whites would be getting off and everyone else would be unjustly punished
[6/7/17, 4:49:12 PM] Justin: forgot that little detail in your analysis
[6/7/17, 4:49:18 PM] Justin: why
[6/7/17, 4:49:24 PM] Dan Watts: at what point will you acknowledge the exceptions swollowing the rule
[6/7/17, 4:49:37 PM] Justin: the reason tehy get off probabyl has everything to do with the university not wanting to acknowledge these thigns and choosing to cover them up
[6/7/17, 4:49:41 PM] Dan Watts: if you say something like white privilege, it has to apply to ALL whites
[6/7/17, 4:49:45 PM] Dan Watts: which just doesn't happen
[6/7/17, 4:49:49 PM] Steve: Also, I can get you cases upon cases where white student athletes get off scott free and black ones don't for the same crime
[6/7/17, 4:49:55 PM] Steve: T does apply to all whites
[6/7/17, 4:49:58 PM] Steve: *it
[6/7/17, 4:50:02 PM] Launchpad: The fact that racism exists in the system doesn't make me privileged for not being a victim
[6/7/17, 4:50:07 PM] Steve: Even you and me on certain ksntnxes
[6/7/17, 4:50:07 PM] Dan Watts: Really? Duke Lacrosse?
[6/7/17, 4:50:14 PM] Justin: but its meant in a context that white people dont experience life in the way a minority does
[6/7/17, 4:50:09 PM] Donk: we had a black president, racism doesnt exist
[6/7/17, 4:50:15 PM] Steve: *instances
[6/7/17, 4:50:25 PM] Steve: Kid from Stanford?
[6/7/17, 4:50:35 PM] Steve: Guy raped and unconscious girl and got 3 months
[6/7/17, 4:50:37 PM] Justin: its just inherent...everyone see color, and in america color is a huge dividing issue
[6/7/17, 4:50:41 PM] Steve: Get outta here watts
[6/7/17, 4:50:46 PM] Donk: btw, those duke lacrosse players not only got off in the end, but got paid 20 million by the school each ontop of it
[6/7/17, 4:50:56 PM] Justin: our parnets were around when blacks couldnt vote
[6/7/17, 4:50:56 PM] Brian Katz: Black privilege right there
[6/7/17, 4:51:09 PM] Justin: this isnt like were tlaking about the middle ages
[6/7/17, 4:51:19 PM] Justin: blacks to this day are discriminated against finacaiklly
[6/7/17, 4:51:20 PM] Dan Watts: Ok-1 kid from stanford gets off bc his dad knows the judge- therefore white privilege exists?
[6/7/17, 4:51:21 PM] Dan Watts: no way
[6/7/17, 4:51:24 PM] Justin: given laons at higher int rates
[6/7/17, 4:51:34 PM] Dan Watts: OJ Simpson got off, clearly guilty
[6/7/17, 4:51:46 PM] Dan Watts: Must've been the racist system holding him down
[6/7/17, 4:52:08 PM] Dan Watts: theres such a wide disparity of results that for you to say privilege exists based on race is total malarky
[6/7/17, 4:52:15 PM] Donk: well, to be fair, he got off actually because of the racist system ironically
[6/7/17, 4:52:17 PM] Miller: quick everyone find the most extreme examples possible to make your case
[6/7/17, 4:52:18 PM] Miller: and go!
[6/7/17, 4:52:26 PM] Justin: yeh thats fucken insane
[6/7/17, 4:52:35 PM] Justin: no logic in bringing oj simpson up
[6/7/17, 4:52:53 PM] Steve: Mine was not extreme, literally a black student athlete was given 17 years for the same crime
[6/7/17, 4:52:54 PM] Justin: its like as if i said charles manson represents that whites are serial killers
[6/7/17, 4:52:56 PM] Steve: Wonder why?
[6/7/17, 4:52:57 PM] Miller: the athlete thing is more showing that rich/wealthy/elite can get away with shit that athletes per se
[6/7/17, 4:52:58 PM] Kiyoon: Herm you sayin that you, me and TK walk into a bank and apply for a loan
[6/7/17, 4:53:03 PM] Steve: Must be because he was worse at sports
[6/7/17, 4:53:04 PM] Justin: yes
[6/7/17, 4:53:06 PM] Justin: yes
[6/7/17, 4:53:05 PM] Kiyoon: we all getting different rates cause of race?
[6/7/17, 4:53:05 PM] Launchpad: why is there logic in bringing up the length of criminal sentences for felons when we're not felons
[6/7/17, 4:53:06 PM] Justin: yes
[6/7/17, 4:53:15 PM] Miller: unfair example nobody is giving herman a loan
[6/7/17, 4:53:22 PM] Justin: but also true
[6/7/17, 4:53:30 PM] Justin: what?
[6/7/17, 4:53:30 PM] Donk: and its yes, assuming you all had the same finincial situation
[6/7/17, 4:53:34 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/7/17, 4:53:46 PM] Donk: katz is really pushing this joke
[6/7/17, 4:53:47 PM] Justin: im saying recreational drug use in white america verus in black america..... conviction for said drug use in white america...versus black amrica
[6/7/17, 4:53:56 PM] Miller: also yes the CFPB has been prosecuting companies for years now (auto lenders mostly) for discrimination and giving minorities higher interest rates
[6/7/17, 4:53:57 PM] Justin: it has nothing to do with you scott schecter being a felon
[6/7/17, 4:53:58 PM] Miller: thats factual
[6/7/17, 4:54:01 PM] Miller: you can look it up
[6/7/17, 4:54:03 PM] Kiyoon: well that was my point, that I'm assuming it's based off your financial record
[6/7/17, 4:54:11 PM] Miller: partially, for surte
[6/7/17, 4:54:11 PM] Miller: sure
[6/7/17, 4:54:15 PM] Justin: its not though and they have bene sued because its not
[6/7/17, 4:54:15 PM] Donk: it is
[6/7/17, 4:54:18 PM] Justin: and supposed to be
[6/7/17, 4:54:19 PM] Donk: but its more than that
[6/7/17, 4:54:24 PM] Miller: and no amount of skin color is going to overcome hermans lack of job or income or credit
[6/7/17, 4:54:31 PM] Justin: lol
[6/7/17, 4:54:32 PM] Steve: That's also true
[6/7/17, 4:55:00 PM] Miller: but a better example would be all things equal income/credit would a minority be charged a higher rate on a loan? the answer has been (and probably in lots of places still is) yes
[6/7/17, 4:55:06 PM] Justin: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/29/bank-pay-106m-over-loan-discrimination-charges/86526572/
[6/7/17, 4:55:24 PM] Miller: ALLY got dinged with it, santander consumer
[6/7/17, 4:55:24 PM] Kiyoon: but how in this day and age does that pass
[6/7/17, 4:55:28 PM] Justin: i mean you can google and find much alrger examples...but thats a  small bank so the problem is rampant
[6/7/17, 4:55:28 PM] Miller: im sure there is more
[6/7/17, 4:55:37 PM] Miller: b/c they can get away with it
[6/7/17, 4:55:53 PM] Miller: and higher yields generate higher revenues
[6/7/17, 4:55:55 PM] Miller: which generates higher income
[6/7/17, 4:56:21 PM] Donk: its not only just on loans, its really bad in terms of car insurance rates
[6/7/17, 4:56:30 PM] Kiyoon: yes, but you think someone goes to their manager and says, hey that dudes spanish, lets give him a 15% rate
[6/7/17, 4:56:32 PM] Justin: yeh there were subrime lending suits that showed discrimination in who banks targets with subprime... as in black families who would qualify for prime were still given subprime loans
[6/7/17, 4:57:08 PM] Miller: no it was more like when they put the ethnicity into the loan generator machine computer it spits out a higher #
[6/7/17, 4:57:08 PM] Justin: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/nyregion/hudson-city-bank-settlement.html
[6/7/17, 4:57:18 PM] Justin: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/wells-fargo-loans-lawsuit_n_6261356.html
[6/7/17, 4:57:22 PM] Donk: i think we need to acknowlege that all of this talk of facts is hurting launchpads feelings
[6/7/17, 4:57:26 PM] Launchpad: Santandander has the lowest rates of income verification in the auto loans they gave out compared to their competitors
[6/7/17, 4:57:29 PM] Kiyoon: I'm not disputing that it happens
[6/7/17, 4:57:40 PM] Launchpad: Im short SC
[6/7/17, 4:57:41 PM] Miller: they stopped being able to ask "ethnicity" so then they switched to basing it off ethnic sounding names
[6/7/17, 4:57:44 PM] Kiyoon: I'm saying, how is it that this still happens
[6/7/17, 4:57:56 PM] Justin: ^^^^see above
[6/7/17, 4:57:56 PM] Donk: because racism?
[6/7/17, 4:58:00 PM] Justin: what started this whole thing
[6/7/17, 4:58:01 PM] Justin: lol
[6/7/17, 4:58:15 PM] Kiyoon: but how is that not found in any audits
[6/7/17, 4:58:22 PM] Justin: actually he crushed it other day with his statement
[6/7/17, 4:59:05 PM] Launchpad: Guys I've got some good news for you: our companies white COO retired and was replaced by an asian woman
[6/7/17, 4:59:15 PM] Justin: thanks for lead in katz
[6/7/17, 4:59:16 PM] Justin: http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/racially-motivated-slur-spray-painted-lebron-james-home/story?id=47747042
[6/7/17, 4:59:29 PM] Miller: @16318489683 theres some white priveldge for you
[6/7/17, 4:59:56 PM] Miller: it is being found
[6/7/17, 4:59:59 PM] Dan Watts: Thanks for reminding me- white privilege doesn't apply to asians and indians
[6/7/17, 5:00:00 PM] Brian Katz: God damn! Who is this white guy?
[6/7/17, 5:00:19 PM] Brian Katz: He probably falls three feet short of the rim lol
[6/7/17, 5:00:20 PM] Launchpad: the fact that there are some racist assholes in the world doesn't make all whites privileged
[6/7/17, 5:00:23 PM] Miller: indians and asians are probably 2 of the most discriminated against groups in the country
[6/7/17, 5:00:36 PM] Miller: and its much more socially acceptable to make fun of them
[6/7/17, 5:00:40 PM] Steve: There are many racist assholes in the world
[6/7/17, 5:00:47 PM] Justin: once agian thats not the fucken point
[6/7/17, 5:00:49 PM] Steve: And in this country, its become normal now
[6/7/17, 5:00:55 PM] Launchpad: yet they don't have any problems making $$
[6/7/17, 5:01:02 PM] Brian Katz: Guys looking directly at lebrons dick
[6/7/17, 5:01:03 PM] Justin: the point is racist people distort the outcomes for minorities which puts them at a disadvantage
[6/7/17, 5:01:06 PM] Miller: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4658458/
[6/7/17, 5:01:17 PM] Justin: you cna be white and not racist and that still happens
[6/7/17, 5:01:29 PM] Justin: hence "white privilege"
[6/7/17, 5:01:31 PM] Steve: ^also that
[6/7/17, 5:01:50 PM] Steve: Just because you have white privileged doesn't mean you are racist
[6/7/17, 5:01:59 PM] Justin: in the case of banks they do it to profit
[6/7/17, 5:02:12 PM] Steve: Katz, it hasn't been funny at any point since you've started posting
[6/7/17, 5:02:20 PM] Steve: It's cheese level corny now
[6/7/17, 5:02:25 PM] Miller: yes its not a lets exploit minorities b/c we are evil fatcats and sitting around smoking cigars
[6/7/17, 5:02:35 PM] Miller: its lets exploit minorities b/c it makes us wealthier
[6/7/17, 5:02:46 PM] Justin: its na exploit because they are most vulnerable
[6/7/17, 5:09:31 PM] Justin: fyi watts that liberal professor had this happen to him for speaking out about racism
[6/7/17, 5:09:32 PM] Dan Watts: asians and indians get treated as white for the purposes of college admissions and jobs because they aren't "underrepresnted minorities" can someone tell me why or how thats fair and not racist
[6/7/17, 5:09:33 PM] Justin: "Weinstein‚Äôs op-ed, which was the first time the lurid details of the event were publicly stated, began a chain of outcry over the fraternity‚Äôs actions, ultimately resulting in an investigation by the university and an 18-month suspension.

As a whistleblower, Weinstein received death threats over the phone and was "verbally harassed" in-person by fraternity members. 

He took a leave of absence from Penn and, though he later returned, said the place was ‚Äúpoisonous‚Äù for him because of how he had been treated."
[6/7/17, 5:09:58 PM] Steve: That's not even remotely true
[6/7/17, 5:10:02 PM] Dan Watts: absnesne form penn?
[6/7/17, 5:10:08 PM] Justin: yeh
[6/7/17, 5:10:07 PM] Dan Watts: that's not remotely true
[6/7/17, 5:10:10 PM] Dan Watts: i went to law school
[6/7/17, 5:10:15 PM] Justin: its obviosuly true
[6/7/17, 5:10:17 PM] Dan Watts: he teaches at evergreen state college
[6/7/17, 5:10:22 PM] Justin: ok
[6/7/17, 5:10:27 PM] Justin: and serach beyond breitbart
[6/7/17, 5:10:27 PM] Steve: That could literally be a breitbart headline
[6/7/17, 5:10:31 PM] Justin: its in forbes
[6/7/17, 5:10:35 PM] Dan Watts: bret weinstein
[6/7/17, 5:10:46 PM] Justin: he recieved death threats for callign out fraternites treatment of baclm strippers
[6/7/17, 5:10:50 PM] Justin: its the same guy
[6/7/17, 5:11:04 PM] Dan Watts: ok so i dont get your point
[6/7/17, 5:11:06 PM] Justin: and logical thinking liberal agrees with him on his stance now as well
[6/7/17, 5:11:22 PM] Justin: where is the right to highlight those actions as deplorable?
[6/7/17, 5:11:35 PM] Justin: funny that is absent form the conversation in there articles
[6/7/17, 5:11:51 PM] Justin: instead they focus on something we all agree is equally as deplorable
[6/7/17, 5:12:04 PM] Dan Watts: i don't get your point
[6/7/17, 5:12:06 PM] Dan Watts: at all
[6/7/17, 5:12:12 PM] Justin: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danspinelli/2017/06/06/the-professor-at-the-center-of-controversy-at-evergreen-state-has-a-history-of-fighting-racism/2/#481652414daa
[6/7/17, 5:12:16 PM] Dan Watts: his tenure at evergreen is in jeapordy
[6/7/17, 5:12:30 PM] Dan Watts: exactly my point!
[6/7/17, 5:12:39 PM] Dan Watts: hes not a racist at all, and he can't even walk on campus
[6/7/17, 5:13:10 PM] Justin: ok and thats wrong.....noone disagrees
[6/7/17, 5:13:15 PM] Donk: so watts, because this one teacher was treated badly, you reject the entire concept of white privilige?
[6/7/17, 5:13:54 PM] Steve: Don't forget he thinks Indians and asians aren't treated less fairly than white males
[6/7/17, 5:14:05 PM] Donk: so therefore, racism doesnt exist?
[6/7/17, 5:14:19 PM] Donk: or that whites get treated differently by the system?
[6/7/17, 5:14:46 PM] Justin: yeh please expand
[6/7/17, 5:15:23 PM] Justin: please show proof, because race can onyl be used as a measurement in enrollment, thats the supreme court ruling
[6/7/17, 5:15:37 PM] Dan Watts: LOL- yeah no kidding that's the supreme court ruling
[6/7/17, 5:15:46 PM] Dan Watts: you don't think they admit based on race quotas?
[6/7/17, 5:15:55 PM] Justin: well should be easy to prove
[6/7/17, 5:16:07 PM] Justin: any coneservative economists take a shot at that conundrum yet?
[6/7/17, 5:16:09 PM] Dan Watts: well someone has to sue and there has to be litigation
[6/7/17, 5:16:19 PM] Justin: that would be in court, im tlaking abotu academically
[6/7/17, 5:16:25 PM] Dan Watts: but theres a distinction made between "minorities" and "under-represented minotiries"
[6/7/17, 5:16:35 PM] Dan Watts: URMs- are black latino
[6/7/17, 5:18:34 PM] Dan Watts: https://blueprintlsat.com/lsatblog/law-school-admissions/lsat-instructor-what-i-learned-in-law-school-admissions/
[6/7/17, 5:19:30 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.hourumd.com/
[6/7/17, 5:19:49 PM] Justin: read this oe the other day to add fuel http://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-hiring-bias-men-with-high-class-hobbies-more-likely-to-get-summer-associate-interviews-than-women/
[6/7/17, 5:19:52 PM] Steve: So you believe race quotas are racist against whites?
[6/7/17, 5:21:12 PM] Steve: Even though 50 years ago, non whites couldn't attend white colleges? And although "that's in the past" you think non whites don't get judged differently in almost all social settings?
[6/7/17, 5:21:20 PM] Steve: You're smarter than that watts
[6/7/17, 5:21:26 PM] Dan Watts: i think race quotas are bullshit
[6/7/17, 5:21:45 PM] Dan Watts: and unconstitutional
[6/7/17, 5:21:50 PM] Steve: Well you would
[6/7/17, 5:21:56 PM] Dan Watts: well that's the law
[6/7/17, 5:21:57 PM] Steve: You are a white male
[6/7/17, 5:22:01 PM] Dan Watts: LOL of course
[6/7/17, 5:22:22 PM] Steve: You don't ever have to worry about your race being an issue
[6/7/17, 5:22:27 PM] Justin: maybe im doing soemthing wrong but yor site sucks
[6/7/17, 5:22:26 PM] Steve: At any point in your life
[6/7/17, 5:22:33 PM] Justin: and your first link doesnt say how much
[6/7/17, 5:23:16 PM] Justin: fyi the calculator shows that something like 12 URM made it into law school
[6/7/17, 5:23:34 PM] Justin: with good scores
[6/7/17, 5:23:50 PM] Dan Watts: the point is that you're status as being URM gives you an advantage as opposed to being a non-URM e.g. indian/asian
[6/7/17, 5:23:52 PM] Justin: idk how i can make this usefyul without automating it
[6/7/17, 5:24:51 PM] Dan Watts: So essentially, me defending something unconstitutional makes me racist?
[6/7/17, 5:24:58 PM] Justin: actually i can look at the in with worse category
[6/7/17, 5:25:06 PM] Dan Watts: Because I don't believe in race quotas
[6/7/17, 5:25:06 PM] Steve: That's what you got out of that? Lol
[6/7/17, 5:25:12 PM] Justin: which ranges from 30-50%
[6/7/17, 5:25:16 PM] Steve: No, I think you are just wrong
[6/7/17, 5:25:19 PM] Steve: Not racist
[6/7/17, 5:25:39 PM] Dan Watts: I disagree with race quotas which you believe is because I'm a white guy
[6/7/17, 5:25:42 PM] Dan Watts: and that's not racist
[6/7/17, 5:26:10 PM] Steve: No, I believe you don't believe in race quotas because you have whites privilege and think that they are unnecessary.
[6/7/17, 5:26:25 PM] Steve: That is because it doesn't affect you
[6/7/17, 5:26:28 PM] Justin: well hes right that the court says they are unconsitutional
[6/7/17, 5:26:28 PM] Steve: So it's wrong
[6/7/17, 5:26:30 PM] Dan Watts: ITS NOT CONSTITUTIONAL
[6/7/17, 5:26:42 PM] Steve: So is racial profiling
[6/7/17, 5:26:49 PM] Justin: which is also why i doubt they truly exist
[6/7/17, 5:26:48 PM] Steve: Do you stand up against that?
[6/7/17, 5:26:52 PM] Dan Watts: and if you are so strong for race quotas- let's apply it to professional sports
[6/7/17, 5:26:58 PM] Steve: Or is that just "part of cop business"
[6/7/17, 5:27:19 PM] Steve: Or is it only when it affects you that it's a problem?
[6/7/17, 5:27:23 PM] Justin: i mean well the question would be what is the purpose of said quota
[6/7/17, 5:27:22 PM] Miller: should herman be allowed to work at hooters?
[6/7/17, 5:27:40 PM] Justin: private business can do whatever the fuck they wnat pretty much
[6/7/17, 5:27:49 PM] Justin: i do have hooters
[6/7/17, 5:27:57 PM] Miller: arent most of these colleges private
[6/7/17, 5:27:58 PM] Dan Watts: Every NBA team has to have 1 asian, 1 indian, 4 blacks, a hispanic and 6 whites because that represents society as a whole
[6/7/17, 5:28:10 PM] Miller: and 1/2 women?
[6/7/17, 5:28:18 PM] Justin: watts would know more but i think supreme court ruling deals wth public schools
[6/7/17, 5:28:21 PM] Miller: and 1/3 children and 1/3 old people
[6/7/17, 5:28:22 PM] Steve: Sounds good to me
[6/7/17, 5:28:28 PM] Steve: I just probably wouldn't watch it
[6/7/17, 5:28:37 PM] Steve: But I'd at least give t a chance
[6/7/17, 5:28:45 PM] Steve: Like I have women's basketball
[6/7/17, 5:28:54 PM] Steve: Now that shit sucks
[6/7/17, 5:30:10 PM] Justin: why is that hoop 8 foot tall?
[6/7/17, 5:30:42 PM] Launchpad: AND every tech company
[6/7/17, 5:31:08 PM] Launchpad: "tech companies aren't diverse" --person who has never worked in tech
[6/7/17, 5:31:36 PM] Brian Katz: It seems that way @herm because of black privilege
[6/7/17, 5:32:04 PM] Justin: deeper----slavery-------so white privilege
[6/7/17, 5:32:09 PM] Justin: all comes full circle
[6/7/17, 5:32:32 PM] Dan Watts: its an enormous fallacy to say because a certain industry does not identically mirror the population at a whole that there's discriminatory practice going on
[6/7/17, 5:32:42 PM] Miller: "tech companies aren't diverse" --literally everyone
[6/7/17, 5:33:08 PM] Justin: look can or shoudl something be done...once again ok lets argue
[6/7/17, 5:33:08 PM] Miller: Including people who work at tech companies
[6/7/17, 5:33:30 PM] Justin: but to point out that 95% ceo are men, and there is no real reason in terms of intellectual ability for that
[6/7/17, 5:33:44 PM] Justin: not sure baout my 95% number made it up
[6/7/17, 5:34:04 PM] Justin: lol its 96
[6/7/17, 5:34:07 PM] Launchpad: false
[6/7/17, 5:34:40 PM] Launchpad: The SJW's wont be satisfied until it does
[6/7/17, 5:35:19 PM] Justin: there sure as fuck is discrimnotry pracitce...its called immigration and trade laws
[6/7/17, 5:35:30 PM] Justin: also known as capitlaism
[6/7/17, 5:38:08 PM] Launchpad: thats not facebooks fault
[6/7/17, 5:39:16 PM] Miller: It does amuse me how upset people get about the phrase white privilege, nobody is telling you to feel guilty about being white, which seems to the default defensiveness. You can acknowledge something without personally feeling guilty
[6/7/17, 5:39:28 PM] Justin: never said it was... there could be a number of reasons for tech companies failing to attract a diverse workforce...but among those reasons im sure  a predominant factor is the unequal opportunity given to minority's(white privilege)
[6/7/17, 5:39:38 PM] Miller: It's also an equally enormous fallacy to say it isn't
[6/7/17, 5:39:41 PM] Justin: cue angry scott
[6/7/17, 5:40:20 PM] Steve: I am white and I don't feel guilty it exists
[6/7/17, 5:40:37 PM] Steve: I would assume Herman and Miller feel the same
[6/7/17, 5:40:42 PM] Steve: And donk
[6/7/17, 5:41:05 PM] Steve: It also doesn't make you racist to admit it exists and try to be above it
[6/7/17, 5:41:18 PM] Justin: milelr never feels the smae way i do
[6/7/17, 5:41:23 PM] Justin: just clearing that up
[6/7/17, 5:41:30 PM] Miller: Opposite of guilty, I'm pretty happy about not worrying about being pulled over for driving while black or being randomly stopped or searched
[6/7/17, 5:41:49 PM] Miller: I get treated very well by almost everyone (in the real world not you assholes)
[6/7/17, 5:41:50 PM] Launchpad: I still am
[6/7/17, 5:43:21 PM] Dan Watts: i don't feel guilty at all
[6/7/17, 5:43:41 PM] Dan Watts: but you have black lives matter people saying white people should put money into black bank accounts as reparrations
[6/7/17, 5:43:53 PM] Dan Watts: how is that not an imposition of guilt
[6/7/17, 5:45:14 PM] Dan Watts: you're in favor of race based quotas
[6/7/17, 5:45:21 PM] Dan Watts: thus you feel guilty
[6/7/17, 5:45:48 PM] Miller: Launchpad just gets upset because he thinks the phrase diminishes everything he has accomplished, the reality is a mix of both, I worked my ass off to get where I am (and mostly still do) but I'd be stupid not to acknowledge the amount of people who even get an opportunity to start working at a hedge fund right out of college coming from a state school with a middle of the road GPA is basically 0 and clearly I had certain advantages that put me in that situation
[6/7/17, 5:46:13 PM] Kiyoon: Steve you confused man, you spanish
[6/7/17, 5:46:49 PM] Steve: Sorry guy, I'm in favor because I know discrimination exists
[6/7/17, 5:46:55 PM] Steve: Not because I feel guilty
[6/7/17, 5:47:11 PM] Steve: But because being non white puts you behind white men/women like myself
[6/7/17, 5:47:18 PM] Justin: I agree with BLM, but also agree targeting apathy as oppostion, is insane
[6/7/17, 5:47:29 PM] Steve: That's not feeling guilty that's trying to do something to even the playing field
[6/7/17, 5:47:34 PM] Justin: in the end of the day im white, i rreally dont give a fuck about it
[6/7/17, 5:47:36 PM] Miller: And you have white people saying slavery should be reinstated, clearly there's extremes to every argument
[6/7/17, 5:47:55 PM] Justin: i recognize it, but as miller says, never ognna effect me.  Demonizing me is stupid
[6/7/17, 5:48:05 PM] Dan Watts: BLM is deemed socially acceptable
[6/7/17, 5:48:05 PM] Steve: And I'm European @16313981203
[6/7/17, 5:48:08 PM] Steve: Makes me white
[6/7/17, 5:48:09 PM] Dan Watts: white racists arent
[6/7/17, 5:48:28 PM] Miller: The main message behind blm is what's deemed socially acceptable
[6/7/17, 5:48:37 PM] Steve: Black lives matter is a movement for equality
[6/7/17, 5:48:49 PM] Justin: also asking for reparations for slavery isn't exactly uncalled for
[6/7/17, 5:48:49 PM] Steve: Whether their are members who are extremists is a different story
[6/7/17, 5:48:54 PM] Steve: Doesn't represent the whole
[6/7/17, 5:48:55 PM] Miller: Clearly not everything anyone affiliated has ever said
[6/7/17, 5:49:06 PM] Steve: I actually can't believe this has to be explained to you
[6/7/17, 5:49:13 PM] Miller: Also white racists are pretty socially acceptable
[6/7/17, 5:49:14 PM] Miller: We president now!
[6/7/17, 5:49:14 PM] Steve: I get LP because, well, it's LP
[6/7/17, 5:50:15 PM] Miller: Like saying you shouldn't demonize the entire Muslim religion as terrorists doesn't mean you also have accept extremism
[6/7/17, 5:50:25 PM] Dan Watts: i have a hard time separating the extremists of BLM from what's considered "mainstream" BLM
[6/7/17, 5:50:41 PM] Steve: We'll have you ever spoken to a BLM member?
[6/7/17, 5:50:43 PM] Dan Watts: I think islam is a perfect analogy
[6/7/17, 5:50:48 PM] Steve: Or you just reading breitbart?
[6/7/17, 5:50:54 PM] Dan Watts: no but i see them on Bill Maher
[6/7/17, 5:50:57 PM] Dan Watts: i don't read breitbart
[6/7/17, 5:50:59 PM] Steve: Oh
[6/7/17, 5:51:00 PM] Steve: Yea
[6/7/17, 5:51:05 PM] Steve: Great show
[6/7/17, 5:51:07 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/7/17, 5:51:55 PM] Justin: yeh ive given up on bill maher...never actually liked him and thoguht his discussion was all shallow, but he served a purpose when i coudlnt get any progressive news with his panelists
[6/7/17, 5:52:01 PM] Justin: now i have facebook
[6/7/17, 5:52:53 PM] Justin: watts how you gonna target islam and not christianity?
[6/7/17, 5:53:02 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/06/05/virginia-mosque-embattled-after-imam-said-female-genital-mutilation-prevents-hypersexuality/?utm_term=.29a431f92642
[6/7/17, 5:53:16 PM] Justin: powerful
[6/7/17, 5:53:16 PM] Dan Watts: 95% of terrorist attacks done by islamic extremists
[6/7/17, 5:53:20 PM] Miller: Like are there people who follow Islam who absolutely hate the US and everyone else and want us dead? Sure
[6/7/17, 5:53:32 PM] Justin: http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/28/american-girl-11-forced-to-marry-adult-rapist-after-becoming-pregnant-6667851/
[6/7/17, 5:53:33 PM] Miller: There are Christians who think that also
[6/7/17, 5:53:34 PM] Miller: Using extremes as reasoning generalizing an entire group is silly
[6/7/17, 5:53:35 PM] Justin: hmmm???
[6/7/17, 5:53:45 PM] Miller: Hell I probably strongly disagree with most orthodox Jews about everything
[6/7/17, 5:53:54 PM] Justin: no i think all chirstian pastors force 11 yo girls to marry rpaists
[6/7/17, 5:54:23 PM] Justin: if you are gonna target mulsim americans, you are in for a rough ride here
[6/7/17, 5:54:23 PM] Miller: Okay but what percentage of people who follow Islam are terrorists
[6/7/17, 5:54:31 PM] Justin: claerly christian americans got more crazy than muslim americans
[6/7/17, 5:54:34 PM] Justin: i dont think its that close
[6/7/17, 5:54:40 PM] Dan Watts: more than any percentage of any other relgiion
[6/7/17, 5:54:41 PM] Miller: Look Herman just admit Joya is part of a sleeper cell
[6/7/17, 5:54:56 PM] Brian Katz: Chick is fire
[6/7/17, 5:55:11 PM] Dan Watts: how many more terrorist attacks does there need to be before we say let's look at the root cause here
[6/7/17, 5:55:26 PM] Dan Watts: are christians blowing shit up at the rate islam is?
[6/7/17, 5:55:35 PM] Dan Watts: and i don't fuck with chrsitians either
[6/7/17, 5:55:38 PM] Miller: How many more school shootings before we ban teenagers
[6/7/17, 5:55:40 PM] Justin: did you say that about the irish 20 years ago?
[6/7/17, 5:55:50 PM] Dan Watts: not even remotely near the rate
[6/7/17, 5:56:00 PM] Dan Watts: that's an unfair and absurd comparison
[6/7/17, 5:56:21 PM] Justin: really, a cultural and religous war resulting in terrorism is a bad naalogy?
[6/7/17, 5:56:38 PM] Justin: oh school thing... can we admit that islamic terrorism isnt an issue her ein america?
[6/7/17, 5:57:05 PM] Justin: and that right wing and christian militants are a much more dangerous threat?
[6/7/17, 5:57:06 PM] Miller: More school shootings are done by white teenagers than any other group
[6/7/17, 5:57:13 PM] Justin: or that christian voters want to electric shock the gay out of people?
[6/7/17, 5:58:16 PM] Dan Watts: ok fine, theres 1 school shooting a year, there's literally a terroirst incident daily. and that's not to justify school shooting there should be 0
[6/7/17, 5:58:17 PM] Miller: A fucking jew was calling in bomb threats to the jcc, does he represent me?
[6/7/17, 5:58:46 PM] Miller: What if for the next year every month a jew commits a terrorist act in the US?
[6/7/17, 5:58:54 PM] Justin: ok... but whose fault is most of it in the end?
[6/7/17, 5:58:57 PM] Miller: Does that somehow make me more likely to be a terrorist?
[6/7/17, 5:59:03 PM] Justin: its such a shallow opinion on what is happening
[6/7/17, 5:59:10 PM] Dan Watts: no
[6/7/17, 5:59:15 PM] Justin: we are installing all these crazies into political positions of power
[6/7/17, 5:59:25 PM] Dan Watts: but i'd say what's going on with judiasm that theres terrorist attacks daily
[6/7/17, 5:59:29 PM] Justin: we are arming these ilitias which beocme religous fundamentaists
[6/7/17, 5:59:33 PM] Steve: And their is more than 1 school shooting a year in the us
[6/7/17, 5:59:43 PM] Dan Watts: ok let's say theres 2 steve
[6/7/17, 5:59:58 PM] Miller: Crazy people do bad things
[6/7/17, 6:00:01 PM] Dan Watts: its no where near the incidents of islamic terrorism
[6/7/17, 6:00:23 PM] Justin: what about almost all of africa?
[6/7/17, 6:00:32 PM] Justin: are you defining any of that as terorrism?
[6/7/17, 6:00:46 PM] Miller: What percentage of people who follow Islam are terrorists? 5 percent? 10 percent? 50 percent? 90 percent?
[6/7/17, 6:00:49 PM] Justin: if there is a central theme its not religion, its us corporate interests
[6/7/17, 6:01:05 PM] Justin: religion is just the tool they use to get poor poeple to follow crazy ideology
[6/7/17, 6:01:10 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/wanstead-nursery-worker-beaten-and-stabbed-by-three-women-shouting-about-allah-a3559251.html
[6/7/17, 6:01:12 PM] Dan Watts: today
[6/7/17, 6:01:18 PM] Dan Watts: i mean it's insane
[6/7/17, 6:01:28 PM] Dan Watts: and i'm not saying therefore islam is bad
[6/7/17, 6:01:35 PM] Dan Watts: or my ex gf is likely to be a terroirst
[6/7/17, 6:01:41 PM] Justin: feel like you been v for vendettaed
[6/7/17, 6:02:20 PM] Dan Watts: however there has to be on some level, an acknowledgement of an issue within islam
[6/7/17, 6:02:31 PM] Miller: But the issue is when you start generalizing that is what you're doing
[6/7/17, 6:02:32 PM] Miller: Whether that's the intended message or not
[6/7/17, 6:02:35 PM] Steve: This is insane
[6/7/17, 6:02:35 PM] Justin: i mean if you mean that as an issue within all religion
[6/7/17, 6:02:36 PM] Justin: sure
[6/7/17, 6:02:45 PM] Miller: I have an issue with almost every level of extremism in religion
[6/7/17, 6:02:56 PM] Justin: if you mena that as within islam... you can say that, but you are assuredly wrong
[6/7/17, 6:02:57 PM] Dan Watts: so do i, i think we all agree there
[6/7/17, 6:03:03 PM] Steve: So Christianity caused the rape of thousands of boys across the world?
[6/7/17, 6:03:19 PM] Steve: The religion caused priests to rape boys and he church to cover it up?
[6/7/17, 6:03:21 PM] Justin: yeh historically islam alot more peaceful
[6/7/17, 6:03:25 PM] Justin: just ask the spanish
[6/7/17, 6:03:25 PM] Steve: Please watts
[6/7/17, 6:03:29 PM] Steve: Get a grip
[6/7/17, 6:03:38 PM] Dan Watts: thats a terrible and poor analogy steve
[6/7/17, 6:03:39 PM] Miller: People use religion as an excuse to do shit
[6/7/17, 6:03:41 PM] Justin: much more peaceful... allowed other rleigons to maintain their religiona nd practices
[6/7/17, 6:03:42 PM] Steve: Don't let that orange fear monger in the whitehouse get to you too
[6/7/17, 6:03:45 PM] Steve: It's not
[6/7/17, 6:03:47 PM] Steve: It's very similar
[6/7/17, 6:03:53 PM] Steve: It's poor because you don't like it
[6/7/17, 6:03:59 PM] Justin: now its obviously being used by a bunch of fucken crazies to do terrible things
[6/7/17, 6:04:02 PM] Dan Watts: and yes, if there was a molestation every day within the catholic church i would say we should look into this
[6/7/17, 6:04:10 PM] Steve: Their is!
[6/7/17, 6:04:19 PM] Justin: yeh netflix got a good new documentary
[6/7/17, 6:04:33 PM] Steve: You just don't hear about it all the time because it's covered up and done to poor kids in poor countries
[6/7/17, 6:04:37 PM] Steve: No you're right watts
[6/7/17, 6:04:52 PM] Steve: It all stopped after the movie about the Boston rapes came out
[6/7/17, 6:04:56 PM] Steve: It all just ended
[6/7/17, 6:04:57 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/7/17, 6:05:00 PM] Steve: Please brah
[6/7/17, 6:05:01 PM] Dan Watts: ok who is saying it ended
[6/7/17, 6:05:12 PM] Dan Watts: who is saying molestation is justified?
[6/7/17, 6:05:19 PM] Steve: I'm not saying you are
[6/7/17, 6:05:30 PM] Dan Watts: ok so if i'm not saying it who is
[6/7/17, 6:05:42 PM] Steve: What I'm saying is RD wrong to blame a religion for extreme criminals
[6/7/17, 6:05:46 PM] Steve: And their actions
[6/7/17, 6:05:53 PM] Steve: You are doing that
[6/7/17, 6:05:57 PM] Dan Watts: i'm not
[6/7/17, 6:06:06 PM] Steve: You are saying Islam is at least partly to blame for terrorism
[6/7/17, 6:06:21 PM] Steve: And I'm saying well Christianity is partly to blame for priests raping children
[6/7/17, 6:06:37 PM] Steve: And you said it right here
[6/7/17, 6:06:43 PM] Steve: Just in case you already forgot
[6/7/17, 6:06:50 PM] Dan Watts: for islamic terrorist yes- when some shows allah akbar while driving a truck through a crowded area i'm going to say islam had something to do it
[6/7/17, 6:07:08 PM] Dan Watts: in the same way, catholics should be accountable for molestations
[6/7/17, 6:07:13 PM] Steve: How is that not the same as a priest saying "god wants you to do this"
[6/7/17, 6:07:22 PM] Steve: What, because they don't scream it?
[6/7/17, 6:07:25 PM] Steve: Come on
[6/7/17, 6:07:30 PM] Steve: Give me a fucking break
[6/7/17, 6:07:48 PM] Dan Watts: there no distinction
[6/7/17, 6:07:56 PM] Dan Watts: you're creating a distinction that doesn't exist
[6/7/17, 6:08:09 PM] Steve: No I'm actually saying they are the same
[6/7/17, 6:08:20 PM] Steve: But you only acknowledge that one is because of religion
[6/7/17, 6:08:22 PM] Steve: Or partly
[6/7/17, 6:08:23 PM] Dan Watts: ok so we are on the same page
[6/7/17, 6:08:28 PM] Steve: The other is just some sick priests
[6/7/17, 6:08:31 PM] Steve: No
[6/7/17, 6:08:42 PM] Steve: I believe both are sick people doing awful things to harm
[6/7/17, 6:08:48 PM] Steve: None are based on religion
[6/7/17, 6:08:50 PM] Dan Watts: agree with that too
[6/7/17, 6:09:00 PM] Dan Watts: well the last part is where we differ
[6/7/17, 6:09:10 PM] Dan Watts: bc you just said the priests justified it by using god
[6/7/17, 6:09:11 PM] Steve: Yea, I know'
[6/7/17, 6:09:14 PM] Steve: That's my point
[6/7/17, 6:09:20 PM] Dan Watts: here
[6/7/17, 6:09:32 PM] Steve: And terrorist use their god
[6/7/17, 6:09:37 PM] Steve: As a reason to kill
[6/7/17, 6:09:42 PM] Steve: Same guy
[6/7/17, 6:09:44 PM] Steve: Same
[6/7/17, 6:09:54 PM] Steve: One just screams something before they kill
[6/7/17, 6:09:58 PM] Dan Watts: correct
[6/7/17, 6:10:08 PM] Steve: The other whispers in little boys ears while they steal their life and innocence
[6/7/17, 6:10:39 PM] Dan Watts: right
[6/7/17, 6:10:43 PM] Dan Watts: and my response is the same
[6/7/17, 6:10:59 PM] Steve: How are you not getting the fact that's a hypocritical stance?
[6/7/17, 6:11:06 PM] Dan Watts: because it's not
[6/7/17, 6:11:18 PM] Steve: To say one religion is partially the cause of harm but the other one isn't
[6/7/17, 6:11:21 PM] Justin: but you are saying lets clal a spade a spade with islam
[6/7/17, 6:11:21 PM] Dan Watts: i'm not saying one is better than the other
[6/7/17, 6:11:28 PM] Justin: but arent claling a spade a spade iwth chrisitinaity
[6/7/17, 6:11:35 PM] Justin: becuaes one is foreign and one is familiar
[6/7/17, 6:11:38 PM] Steve: Thank you Herman a
[6/7/17, 6:11:42 PM] Steve: Am I going crazy?
[6/7/17, 6:12:04 PM] Dan Watts: i would be hypocritcal if i said christianity its ok islam its not
[6/7/17, 6:12:06 PM] Dan Watts: my response is the same
[6/7/17, 6:12:20 PM] Steve: But you aren't clamoring about it
[6/7/17, 6:12:24 PM] Steve: Showing us stats
[6/7/17, 6:12:25 PM] Justin: but are you coneming chrisitainy for child molestation?
[6/7/17, 6:12:25 PM] Steve: Articles
[6/7/17, 6:12:29 PM] Steve: Graphs
[6/7/17, 6:12:30 PM] Steve: Charts
[6/7/17, 6:12:31 PM] Dan Watts: absolutely
[6/7/17, 6:12:35 PM] Steve: But you are about Islam
[6/7/17, 6:12:38 PM] Steve: And terrorism
[6/7/17, 6:12:43 PM] Steve: Crazy how that works
[6/7/17, 6:12:55 PM] Dan Watts: Well terrorism is a global threat that is dramatically transforming life
[6/7/17, 6:13:05 PM] Justin: I mean is it?
[6/7/17, 6:13:11 PM] Steve: So is priests raping boys and girls!
[6/7/17, 6:13:18 PM] Justin: people were getting blown up every day in the 90's in iraq
[6/7/17, 6:13:17 PM] Steve: It's literally happening everywhere
[6/7/17, 6:13:21 PM] Steve: Africa
[6/7/17, 6:13:22 PM] Justin: i didnt hear a peep
[6/7/17, 6:13:25 PM] Steve: South America
[6/7/17, 6:13:32 PM] Steve: Europe
[6/7/17, 6:13:38 PM] Steve: All over
[6/7/17, 6:13:50 PM] Justin: wouth ameirca people were being dissapeared for portesting capoitalism...not a peep
[6/7/17, 6:14:08 PM] Launchpad: "I'd be stupid not to acknowledge the amount of people who even get an opportunity to start working at a hedge fund right out of college coming from a state school with a middle of the road GPA is basically 0 and clearly I had certain advantages that put me in that situation"

Was your race a factor?  Or your network & socioeconomic privilege?
[6/7/17, 6:14:25 PM] Dan Watts: i think molestation is deplorable
[6/7/17, 6:14:26 PM] Justin: yes, yes
[6/7/17, 6:14:30 PM] Dan Watts: and so is genital mutliation
[6/7/17, 6:14:45 PM] Justin: once agian genital mutiliation is as high in african christain nations
[6/7/17, 6:14:51 PM] Justin: its a cultural thing
[6/7/17, 6:15:25 PM] Miller: I mutilated both my kids genitals
[6/7/17, 6:15:31 PM] Miller: In the name of religion
[6/7/17, 6:15:47 PM] Launchpad: I WANT MY FORESKIN BACK
[6/7/17, 6:16:16 PM] Steve: I know we all think molestation and terror I'm is deplorable
[6/7/17, 6:16:39 PM] Dan Watts: females- they remove the clitoris so they can't ever have sexual satisfaction
[6/7/17, 6:16:49 PM] Steve: My point is you cant blame one, even partially, on religion and not the other one when it pertains to priests in the Catholic Church.
[6/7/17, 6:16:53 PM] Steve: That's hypocrisy
[6/7/17, 6:17:23 PM] Steve: Because both are using religion as a shield and we are all smart enough to see past that
[6/7/17, 6:18:45 PM] Dan Watts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_female_genital_mutilation
[6/7/17, 6:19:12 PM] Dan Watts: seems to be grounded in islamic texts
[6/7/17, 6:19:15 PM] Dan Watts: but who cares
[6/7/17, 6:19:49 PM] Dan Watts: I'm doing that
[6/7/17, 6:20:00 PM] Dan Watts: not*
[6/7/17, 6:20:02 PM] Miller: Clearly the latter, but that's the whole crux of the argument
[6/7/17, 6:21:28 PM] Steve: You clearly are doing that here
[6/7/17, 6:21:37 PM] Steve: I mean, come on
[6/7/17, 6:22:42 PM] Dan Watts: yes- and i would say molestation is an issue within catholicism too
[6/7/17, 6:22:49 PM] Dan Watts: I mean, come on
[6/7/17, 6:23:04 PM] Steve: Ok
[6/7/17, 6:23:17 PM] Steve: If that's your stance, at least it's not hypocrisy
[6/7/17, 6:23:23 PM] Steve: But it took you a while to come to that
[6/7/17, 6:23:30 PM] Dan Watts: it did not take awhile
[6/7/17, 6:23:34 PM] Justin: but why arent you hgihlighting the gender mutilation by african christians?
[6/7/17, 6:23:33 PM] Dan Watts: it was the first thing i said
[6/7/17, 6:23:35 PM] Steve: Even though I still don't agree
[6/7/17, 6:23:37 PM] Steve: Nope
[6/7/17, 6:23:39 PM] Dan Watts: and you kept putting owrds in my mouth
[6/7/17, 6:23:43 PM] Justin: forget the preists for a momenty
[6/7/17, 6:23:49 PM] Steve: You can find me where you texted the catholisim part
[6/7/17, 6:23:51 PM] Steve: I'll wait
[6/7/17, 6:23:56 PM] Steve: The Islam part def
[6/7/17, 6:24:01 PM] Steve: I don't
[6/7/17, 6:24:08 PM] Steve: I just keep replying to your words
[6/7/17, 6:24:11 PM] Dan Watts: @13478047760
[6/7/17, 6:24:19 PM] Justin: what about the fact that in sierra leone 80% chiristians practice female mutilation?
[6/7/17, 6:24:24 PM] Dan Watts: so wait no more
[6/7/17, 6:24:30 PM] Justin: 75% in egypt
[6/7/17, 6:25:10 PM] Dan Watts: you make it seem like i'm justifying christian poor practices- i'm not
[6/7/17, 6:25:17 PM] Dan Watts: i don't fuck with ANY religion
[6/7/17, 6:25:32 PM] Dan Watts: but when a practice is rooted in isalmic text i'm calling it out
[6/7/17, 6:25:47 PM] Justin: but its not rooted in text
[6/7/17, 6:25:57 PM] Justin: lets say the quran= the bible
[6/7/17, 6:25:58 PM] Justin: its not there
[6/7/17, 6:26:08 PM] Justin: even says that on the wiki you sent..
[6/7/17, 6:26:13 PM] Dan Watts: adith Sunan Abu Dawood favoring Female Circumcision
One hadith from the Sunan Abu Dawood collection states:[39][40][41]

A woman used to perform circumcision in Medina. The Prophet said to her: Do not cut severely as that is better for a woman and more desirable for a husband.

‚Äî‚ÄâSunan Abu Dawood, 41:5251
[6/7/17, 6:26:16 PM] Dan Watts: what is this
[6/7/17, 6:26:28 PM] Justin: hadith
[6/7/17, 6:26:45 PM] Justin: so hadiths are a bunch of people got together and wanted ot amke more "laws"\
[6/7/17, 6:26:53 PM] Justin: so tehy told stories about what they overheard
[6/7/17, 6:27:05 PM] Justin: some people follow them, some people dont
[6/7/17, 6:33:24 PM] Justin: either way... do you think considering it isnt practiced in southeast Asia, and that throughout Egypt and Africa its practiced by all religions, might indicate that its got a large cultural element to it?
[6/7/17, 6:33:57 PM] Justin: "FGM is found mostly in what Gerry Mackie called an "intriguingly contiguous" zone in Africa‚Äîeast to west from Somalia to Senegal, and north to south from Egypt to Tanzania.[78] Nationally representative figures are available for 27 countries in Africa, as well as Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen. Over 200 million women and girls are thought to be living with FGM in those 30 countries.[3][79]

The highest concentrations among the 15‚Äì49 age group are in Somalia (98 percent), Guinea (97 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent) and Sierra Leone (90 percent).[80] As of 2013, 27.2 million women had undergone FGM in Egypt, 23.8 million in Ethiopia, and 19.9 million in Nigeria.[81] There is also a high concentration in Indonesia, where Type Ia (removal of the clitoral hood) and symbolic nicking (Type IV) are practised; the prevalence rate for the 0‚Äì11 group is 49 percent (13.4 million).[3][79]:2

Smaller studies or anecdotal reports suggest that FGM is also practised in Colombia, the Congo, Malaysia, Oman, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as among the Bedouin in Israel; in Rahmah, Jordan; and among the Dawoodi Bohra in India.[3][82][83] It is also found within immigrant communities in Australasia, Europe, North America and Scandinavia.[84]
[6/7/17, 6:37:20 PM] Justin: also you tlak about bombing and terrorism, why arent we talking about the congo on the news daily?
[6/7/17, 6:38:57 PM] Justin: where's the new to highlisht chechnya and the phillipines murdering gays and drug users
[6/7/17, 6:51:57 PM] Miller: On a lighter note 6 episodes in master of none season 2 is fucking awesome
[6/7/17, 6:57:13 PM] Justin: so review tried to say, hes trying to hard.....fuck that
[6/7/17, 6:57:35 PM] Miller: I wish everybody would try this hard
[6/7/17, 6:57:44 PM] Justin: show is the wire of netflix
[6/7/17, 6:57:57 PM] Justin: already used seinfeld analogy
[6/7/17, 6:57:56 PM] Miller: He's like Donald glover talented
[6/7/17, 7:16:27 PM] Dan Watts: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/waking-up-with-sam-harris/id733163012?mt=2&i=1000378627769
[6/7/17, 7:17:14 PM] Dan Watts: I really encourage everyone to listen to this. It's an interview with a very moderate Muslim American scholar
[6/7/17, 7:18:13 PM] Steve: I'll listen to it in my way to work tomorrow
[6/7/17, 7:20:10 PM] Dan Watts: @16316620763 has branded Sam Harris an islamaphobe but listen to this interview but despite that if you listen to this you'll hear a well reasoned rationale discussion between 2 very bright well researched scholars
[6/7/17, 10:36:25 PM] Launchpad: @17189742074 http://www.adweek.com/creativity/delta-painted-exotic-locales-on-a-brooklyn-wall-for-singles-to-snap-selfies-like-theyre-world-travelers/
[6/7/17, 11:55:12 PM] Brian Katz: Cavs getting swept
[6/8/17, 12:34:38 AM] Dan Watts: So as the cavs were getting swept, I said to myself let's look at these countries in Africa that perform female circumcisions and what population of them is Islam to Christian- a majority of these countries are 80%+ Islam.
[6/8/17, 12:38:13 AM] Dan Watts: So to say a very small religious minority is performing an grotesque act that's purely cultural and totally independent of religion is so intellectually bankrupt I don't even know where to begin. A country like Somalia the official religion is Islam and religion by definition is part of culture
[6/8/17, 12:38:57 AM] Justin: I mean so if I find a predominantly Christian country in Africa with high rates, is it still bankrupt?
[6/8/17, 12:39:37 AM] Dan Watts: Indonesia? Not in Africa
[6/8/17, 12:39:52 AM] Dan Watts: 49% they perform this
[6/8/17, 12:40:42 AM] Justin: http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/02/reza-aslan/fact-checking-reza-aslans-retort-bill-maher/
[6/8/17, 12:49:26 AM] Dan Watts: Ok I'll grant you it's not totally bankrupt however if 7/8 of top 8 are Islam, and if you aggregate that entire region what do you think the total islam to other percentage is? Also who here without looking at a map can tell you where the country entria is? I haven't gone country by country but it seems in that entire region Ethiopia and entria are the only predominantly Christian ones I can find
[6/8/17, 12:55:40 AM] Dan Watts: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Islamic_countries
I've posted this here before and I'll post it again. the easy thing to say is watts is a islamaphobe. I'm not. But I believe in fundamental human rights and a lot of what's going on is in direct opposition to that. And I certainly don't advocate any other religion which oppresses or abuses other people
[6/8/17, 1:00:55 AM] Justin: And 2/4 are our allies
[6/8/17, 1:01:33 AM] Justin: Saudia Arabia was a forward thinking country before we installed the shah
[6/8/17, 1:03:39 AM] Justin: #freetheclit
[6/8/17, 1:06:33 AM] Dan Watts: Because they're "our" allies this makes what's going on there ok?
[6/8/17, 1:07:52 AM] Dan Watts: Almost all of these counties are undemocratic dictatorships
[6/8/17, 1:21:24 AM] Justin: shows that our battle against The terror of fundamentalism has nothing to do with human rights.  Also begs the question of why do we keep arming religious fundamentalists in these regions.
[6/8/17, 1:28:52 AM] Justin: Like this makes no fucken sense. They just had free fucken elections and have been sticking to Iran deal.
[6/8/17, 7:20:02 AM] Brian Katz: Anyone else think the NBA is stupid at this point? The warriors are about to complete the playoffs without losing one game, and are currently sweeping a team that steamrolled the east, going 12-1.
[6/8/17, 7:21:35 AM] Brian Katz: No parody in the NBA makes for a boring league. This playoffs was forgettable at best. It's going to be interesting next year when Lebron joins the warriors, to see if they can go 82-0 and 16-0
[6/8/17, 7:22:54 AM] Miller: I dont think it's any more stupid than it was yesterday, cavs should have made this a series and they choked down the stretch
[6/8/17, 7:23:41 AM] Brian Katz: One halfway close game, doesn't make a series interesting
[6/8/17, 7:24:13 AM] Miller: There is never any parity, you can look before the season and know which 4 teams will be in the conference finals
[6/8/17, 7:24:42 AM] Brian Katz: YeH but this year it was legit only one team
[6/8/17, 7:25:27 AM] Brian Katz: It's not going to happen, but I'd like to see the league take away like 6 franchises
[6/8/17, 7:26:03 AM] Miller: So if it was 2-1 the series would not be interesting?
[6/8/17, 7:26:05 AM] Miller: Like last season when golden state was up 2 0
[6/8/17, 7:26:09 AM] Miller: Nothing your saying right now didn't apply last year
[6/8/17, 7:30:36 AM] Miller: Or realistically for the 8 years Jordan was in his prime
[6/8/17, 7:30:55 AM] Miller: The only difference is this year the actual games were not good or entertaining
[6/8/17, 7:31:19 AM] Miller: It happens, March madness early rounds were way worse this year vs last
[6/8/17, 7:31:30 AM] Steve: Katz, what about the patriots donination?
[6/8/17, 7:31:45 AM] Steve: Haven't they won 5 Super Bowls and like 14 division titles
[6/8/17, 7:31:48 AM] Steve: No parity
[6/8/17, 7:32:00 AM] Steve: And they assembled a super team his offseason
[6/8/17, 7:32:04 AM] Steve: Not fair
[6/8/17, 7:32:20 AM] Steve: Or what about the Yankees dominatin in the 90's?
[6/8/17, 7:32:30 AM] Steve: No parity
[6/8/17, 7:32:37 AM] Miller: I think the gap between the Patriots and the second best afc team is easily as big as gsw and 2nd best Western team
[6/8/17, 7:32:45 AM] Steve: Yup
[6/8/17, 7:33:03 AM] Steve: Leagues have different trends
[6/8/17, 7:33:18 AM] Steve: Sometimes they have warriors and sometimes they have more parity
[6/8/17, 7:33:18 AM] Miller: The only difference in football is higher injury risk so more chances for teams to underperform
[6/8/17, 7:33:33 AM] Miller: And because it's a 1 game playoff more variance
[6/8/17, 7:33:37 AM] Steve: What about the red wings domination?
[6/8/17, 7:33:56 AM] Steve: Or the devils?
[6/8/17, 7:34:04 AM] Steve: Even the islanders winning 4 straight
[6/8/17, 7:34:19 AM] Steve: Every sport has this
[6/8/17, 7:34:51 AM] Steve: If anything, we should appreciate that team. How many of those will we see?
[6/8/17, 7:35:22 AM] Steve: It's literally all of our nba franchise dreams as kids to figure out how to assemble that and the warriors did it IRL
[6/8/17, 7:35:35 AM] Steve: At least it was mine on franchise mode
[6/8/17, 7:37:41 AM] Miller: katz is just mad bc he thinks this warriors team is actually unbeatable
[6/8/17, 7:38:02 AM] Steve: Also, if Durant wins two straight, he might pull a lebron and go back to OKC
[6/8/17, 7:38:06 AM] Miller: which is silly, granted CLE is the only team that can beat them, but if they played 100 games it would be 60/40 or 70/30 at worst
[6/8/17, 7:38:31 AM] Steve: I don't even think it would be that close
[6/8/17, 7:38:41 AM] Steve: 80/20
[6/8/17, 7:38:45 AM] Steve: 90/10
[6/8/17, 7:39:43 AM] Scott: 70/30
[6/8/17, 7:41:31 AM] Steve: #cheesehottaek
[6/8/17, 7:46:45 AM] Steve: But if Westbrook doesn't win the MVP, in with @16318489683 and boycotting ball on TV
[6/8/17, 7:47:01 AM] Steve: *I'm
[6/8/17, 7:48:54 AM] Miller: the NBA ad revenue will surely not be able to recover from the 12 games you 2 watched combined this year
[6/8/17, 7:49:40 AM] Steve: I watched more than that and I did not say the NBA would be hurt by it.
[6/8/17, 7:50:10 AM] Steve: Just joining the resistance if Westbrook doesn't win what is rightfully his.
[6/8/17, 7:50:14 AM] Miller: sounded like a threat
[6/8/17, 7:50:26 AM] Steve: It's a promise
[6/8/17, 7:50:53 AM] Steve: What can I put behind the statement to differentiate? Always want to follow #millerwhattsapprules
[6/8/17, 7:50:55 AM] Miller: if the predators dont win the cup im boycotting hockey
[6/8/17, 7:51:07 AM] Steve: Sounds like a promise
[6/8/17, 7:51:36 AM] Steve: Maybe we should put a - T or P
[6/8/17, 7:51:41 AM] Steve: After it
[6/8/17, 8:06:52 AM] Scott: I wonder how much money will be lost if there are no games 5 thru 7
[6/8/17, 8:06:57 AM] Scott: ü§î
[6/8/17, 8:07:15 AM] Steve: ESPN did a story on it yesterday
[6/8/17, 8:07:46 AM] Scott: I shall find it
[6/8/17, 8:09:15 AM] Steve: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19565518/nba-playoffs-warriors-sweep-bottom-line-not-look-wonderful
[6/8/17, 8:09:24 AM] Steve: Sometimes, I can help you out
[6/8/17, 8:09:26 AM] Steve: Only sometimes
[6/8/17, 8:10:51 AM] Miller: LeBron James was +7 in 46 minutes and his team lost by five
[6/8/17, 8:11:09 AM] Miller: also hes averaging a triple double in the playoffs so therefore he is the unquestioned MVP
[6/8/17, 8:13:38 AM] Steve: Wasn't the leagues losses
[6/8/17, 8:13:39 AM] Steve: Just the warriors
[6/8/17, 8:13:39 AM] Steve: If he gets 43 of them, then yes.
[6/8/17, 8:13:40 AM] Steve: Lebron "MVP" all day
[6/8/17, 8:16:08 AM] Miller: lol, stat padding 30/10/10 = the god, unquestioned MVP nobody else is even in the discussion, legit 30/8/8 = you suck, cannot hold westbrooks jock
[6/8/17, 8:16:31 AM] Miller: b/c we all know once a 1 digit number becomes a 2 digit number its a magical celebration
[6/8/17, 8:17:48 AM] Steve: All things I didn't say
[6/8/17, 8:18:09 AM] Steve: Especially the "you suck, cannot hold westbrooks jock"
[6/8/17, 8:18:37 AM] Miller: all things you implied b/c you have said westbrook is the MVP and it is not a debate and your reasoning came down to triple doubles
[6/8/17, 8:20:01 AM] Steve: My reasoning was also based on what the teams would be without said players
[6/8/17, 8:20:12 AM] Steve: None would be lottery teams other than the thunder
[6/8/17, 8:20:22 AM] Steve: Take lebron from Cleveland
[6/8/17, 8:20:30 AM] Steve: Kawahi out of spurs
[6/8/17, 8:20:39 AM] Steve: Harden out of rockets
[6/8/17, 8:20:53 AM] Steve: All those teams would either make the playoffs or be right there
[6/8/17, 8:21:43 AM] Miller: why is the lottery or the playoffs the bar? CLE would go from the 2nd best team in the lg and a contender for the title to a low playoff seed in the east and a nothing team
[6/8/17, 8:22:06 AM] Miller: not sure why that dropoff is somehow better than going from a bad playoff team to a bad non-playoff team
[6/8/17, 8:22:21 AM] Steve: Thunder - lottery team
[6/8/17, 8:22:21 AM] Steve: But instead they won 47 games
[6/8/17, 8:22:21 AM] Steve: It's also ok to disagree about it with me
[6/8/17, 8:22:21 AM] Steve: But you aren't going to change my opinion on it
[6/8/17, 8:23:34 AM] Miller: you want a fun experiment? switch their places
[6/8/17, 8:23:46 AM] Miller: put lebron on OKC to start the season and wesbrook in CLE
[6/8/17, 8:23:57 AM] Miller: now tell me what would have happened
[6/8/17, 8:23:57 AM] Steve: To being one of the worst teams in the league?
[6/8/17, 8:23:58 AM] Steve: You're a smart guy right?
[6/8/17, 8:23:58 AM] Steve: I don't need to explain the difference between those two
[6/8/17, 8:24:20 AM] Steve: Can't, cabs have Kylie's
[6/8/17, 8:24:24 AM] Steve: *kyrie
[6/8/17, 8:24:29 AM] Miller: so by that same argument then why did jordan ever win an MVP? his team would not have been one of the worst in the league if he was not on it
[6/8/17, 8:24:32 AM] Miller: they were still a playoff team
[6/8/17, 8:24:32 AM] Steve: Be better at hypotheticals
[6/8/17, 8:24:54 AM] Miller: b/c apparently if you dont go from middle of the pack to one of the worst you are not an MVP
[6/8/17, 8:25:04 AM] Miller: going from middle of the pack to one of the best is somehow less impactful
[6/8/17, 8:25:27 AM] Miller: why didnt AI win the MVP every year? those sixers teams were a joke
[6/8/17, 8:25:54 AM] Steve: I don't want to keep circling around the same arguments. I'll wait until June 26th.
[6/8/17, 8:26:10 AM] Scott: the second best player on those teams were either aaron mckie or samuel dalembert at times
[6/8/17, 8:26:14 AM] Miller: b/c when hes the MVP you are justified
[6/8/17, 8:26:14 AM] Steve: Then I'll either get a free meal or pay for another hibachi
[6/8/17, 8:26:19 AM] Miller: thats not results based logic at all
[6/8/17, 8:26:47 AM] Steve: Damn it
[6/8/17, 8:26:52 AM] Steve: Missed my god damn stop lol
[6/8/17, 8:26:55 AM] Miller: just tell me that jordan never deserved an MVP, its fine
[6/8/17, 8:27:09 AM] Miller: his team would never ever have been a lottery team w/o him
[6/8/17, 8:27:10 AM] Steve: Between the islamaphobe podcast and this discussion, again
[6/8/17, 9:04:36 AM] Brian Katz: The pats have won 5 bowls in 17 years. All of those bowls were decided by one score, including the two they lost against the Giants.
[6/8/17, 9:05:15 AM] Steve: They have the third longest playoff winning streak at 10
[6/8/17, 9:05:21 AM] Steve: From 2002-2006
[6/8/17, 9:05:32 AM] Steve: That's in the history of sports
[6/8/17, 9:05:51 AM] Miller: since 1946 the warriors have won 4 titles,
[6/8/17, 9:06:05 AM] Steve: Sorry 4th behind miseries row and 98-99 Yankees
[6/8/17, 9:06:15 AM] Steve: *murderers row
[6/8/17, 9:06:24 AM] Brian Katz: Great but they're not unbeatable. And if the Falcons didn't choke or played smarter they'd would've won
[6/8/17, 9:06:26 AM] Steve: It's warriors 15 straight
[6/8/17, 9:06:37 AM] Steve: Warriors are beatable also
[6/8/17, 9:06:39 AM] Steve: Not this year
[6/8/17, 9:06:43 AM] Steve: But it will happen
[6/8/17, 9:06:56 AM] Brian Katz: The yanks were dominate not unbeatable.
[6/8/17, 9:07:48 AM] Brian Katz: They played weak sauce braves padres and Mets in those World Series
[6/8/17, 9:07:52 AM] Miller: this somehow doesnt apply to the cavs last night?
[6/8/17, 9:08:10 AM] Steve: That wasn't even those years
[6/8/17, 9:08:19 AM] Steve: They played the mets in 2000
[6/8/17, 9:08:19 AM] Miller: if JR smith doesnt take a stupid heat check falling off the court 1 foot 3 or lebron makes one of those layups or kevin love dunks that ball they win
[6/8/17, 9:08:32 AM] Steve: And the braves had some of the pitchers ever on those teams
[6/8/17, 9:08:32 AM] Brian Katz: They lost by five on they're home court
[6/8/17, 9:08:47 AM] Sean: Serious question would the old heat with lebron beat GS?
[6/8/17, 9:09:17 AM] Brian Katz: No cause they barely got passed the Spurs once
[6/8/17, 9:09:27 AM] Miller: its close, lebron/wade/bosh vs lebron/kyrie/love
[6/8/17, 9:09:32 AM] Miller: that heat team had better role players
[6/8/17, 9:10:03 AM] Miller: but katz doesnt think anyone (even the monstars) could ever possibly even considering coming close to even beating this GSW team so he would say no
[6/8/17, 9:10:04 AM] Scott: Still missing that 4th player on gs
[6/8/17, 9:10:09 AM] Miller: GSW > 92 dream team
[6/8/17, 9:10:20 AM] Scott: Klay hitting shots with steph and kd make it tough
[6/8/17, 9:10:33 AM] Scott: Even forgetting about draymond
[6/8/17, 9:10:33 AM] Brian Katz: The monsters lost the only game they ever played miller
[6/8/17, 9:10:46 AM] Miller: they were undefeated before that
[6/8/17, 9:10:46 AM] Scott: Monstars
[6/8/17, 9:10:54 AM] Scott: Fact
[6/8/17, 9:11:09 AM] Scott: They had an insane record before thay
[6/8/17, 9:11:10 AM] Miller: they def played more than 1 game
[6/8/17, 9:11:17 AM] Steve: They did lose to the greatest player of all time
[6/8/17, 9:11:35 AM] Miller: if only we had whatsapp back then
[6/8/17, 9:11:44 AM] Miller: katz just complainingabout the monstars being unfair
[6/8/17, 9:11:53 AM] Miller: space basketball is stupid
[6/8/17, 9:11:56 AM] Miller: why even bother jordan
[6/8/17, 9:12:03 AM] Miller: what are you gonna do? dunk from 95 ft away?
[6/8/17, 9:15:30 AM] Brian Katz: Unfair ? No they put that team together within the rules of the game. It's just stupid and I'm out. Why watch when you know the outcome? If that's what the NBA wants than at least throw in some off the top rope moves and a pile driver or two.
[6/8/17, 9:18:22 AM] Miller: James played 45 minutes and 31 seconds, and was +7
[6/8/17, 9:18:45 AM] Miller: you can keep pretending like CLE (when lebron is on the court) is not in the same league as this warriors team all you want but its not üì†
[6/8/17, 9:35:22 AM] Brian Katz: Okay but he took a 2:29 second breather and lost by 5
[6/8/17, 9:35:32 AM] Brian Katz: So is it that close?
[6/8/17, 9:35:44 AM] Kiyoon: I mean that was a pretty close game
[6/8/17, 9:35:45 AM] Brian Katz: He should just play all 48
[6/8/17, 9:36:01 AM] Brian Katz: What was the spread? Did the warriors cover?
[6/8/17, 9:36:04 AM] Kiyoon: they lost in the final minute of the game
[6/8/17, 9:36:14 AM] Kiyoon: yeah after CLE fouled twice to make it a 5 pt game
[6/8/17, 9:36:34 AM] Brian Katz: Okay so the warriors covered on the road
[6/8/17, 9:36:38 AM] Kiyoon: you act like you knew GS was gonna win last night
[6/8/17, 9:36:47 AM] Brian Katz: I did
[6/8/17, 9:36:48 AM] Kiyoon: when CLE led the entire game
[6/8/17, 9:37:05 AM] Brian Katz: I was fully confident the entire game that they'd pull out the win
[6/8/17, 9:37:26 AM] Kiyoon: shoulda bet on it you were probably getting plus odds
[6/8/17, 9:37:49 AM] Brian Katz: It wasn't like they were down 15 points, they were down 4 or 5 the whole time
[6/8/17, 9:38:27 AM] Brian Katz: I don't bet anymore, I'm retired. I only bet silly things with you boners. Btw watts where's my signed $20? Lol
[6/8/17, 9:39:26 AM] Dan Watts: New phone who dis
[6/8/17, 9:39:31 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[6/8/17, 9:39:58 AM] Steve: He's now partnered with cheese, you're getting two beers
[6/8/17, 9:40:02 AM] Brian Katz: It's a guy who thought the pacers wouldn't win a game
[6/8/17, 9:40:17 AM] Dan Watts: üçª
[6/8/17, 9:40:29 AM] Brian Katz: You can't sign a beer
[6/8/17, 9:40:30 AM] Miller: none of those games were close either using katz math
[6/8/17, 9:40:45 AM] Miller: CLE won them all handily and they were never in doubt
[6/8/17, 9:40:49 AM] Brian Katz: The close out game was close.
[6/8/17, 9:41:34 AM] Brian Katz: They were never in doubt, because Cleveland was never going to lose to those chumpers
[6/8/17, 12:01:56 PM] Justin: https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedVideo/videos/2225154894292047/
[6/8/17, 12:03:35 PM] Launchpad: corny as fuck
[6/8/17, 12:10:00 PM] Launchpad: And eventually you become an adult and you have an equal footing as everyone else.  When do you get to stop blaming your parents and the first 18 years of your life? 20? 30? 40? Never?
[6/8/17, 12:10:19 PM] Launchpad: Yes, life is unfair and some people have advantages over others
[6/8/17, 12:12:37 PM] Launchpad: Do you get to be 50 years old and cry "waaaaaaah Im not the CEO.  Some rich white guy got to be the CEO. I wasnt born into privilege like him. waaaaaaaa üöëüöëüöëüöë"
[6/8/17, 12:31:59 PM] Scott: scottie ur comments ooze of white privilege
[6/8/17, 12:59:10 PM] Miller: dont worry, everyone live in the world from when you are 4 years old and you can be anything you want to be
[6/8/17, 12:59:21 PM] Miller: i think you had just as good a chance as anyone as being president
[6/8/17, 12:59:25 PM] Miller: or being in the NBA
[6/8/17, 1:00:37 PM] Launchpad: an even better idea would be to tell 4 year olds that they cannot in fact be anything they want to be, because old white men wont let them
[6/8/17, 1:00:59 PM] Launchpad: and white people can still be what they want to be
[6/8/17, 1:01:06 PM] Miller: yes old white men are whats stopping your presidential bid
[6/8/17, 1:01:29 PM] Miller: if i ran a simulation of your life 9 trillion times in how many of those would you becomes president?
[6/8/17, 1:02:44 PM] Launchpad: probably close to around 9 trillion / 300 million
[6/8/17, 1:02:53 PM] Miller: probably not
[6/8/17, 1:03:07 PM] Launchpad: Obama did it
[6/8/17, 1:03:33 PM] Launchpad: sure, if your born in the 1% you have a much higher chance
[6/8/17, 1:03:47 PM] Launchpad: but your odds are still pretty fucken slim
[6/8/17, 1:04:02 PM] Launchpad: Donald Trumps odds were pretty slim all the way until election day
[6/8/17, 1:04:24 PM] Miller: having a 40% chance of being president is slim?
[6/8/17, 1:04:31 PM] Miller: #mathishard
[6/8/17, 1:05:14 PM] Launchpad: I am not disagreeing with the fact that some people are born with an advantage -- what I do disagree with is how much of that is a factor, and how long you can use that excuse to account for your life's failures
[6/8/17, 1:05:53 PM] Miller: well the first part is really all the matters the latter is subjective and frankly meaningless
[6/8/17, 1:06:49 PM] Launchpad: Being rich couldnt get Carly Fiorina elected governer of CA
[6/8/17, 1:06:50 PM] Launchpad: she lost to broke ass Jerry Brown
[6/8/17, 1:07:31 PM] Miller: what is the statu of limitations on "complaining"? what if i was born addicted to heroin to 2 drug addict parents and dropped out of HS and worked menial minium wage jobs my whole life, how long can i "comlpain"? 5 years? 10 years? 15 years?
[6/8/17, 1:08:06 PM] Miller: bc yes the "problem" may have occured during your childhood but the issue is everything you do in life compounds on itself
[6/8/17, 1:21:09 PM] Steve: Doesn't take much @19732079889

[6/8/17, 9:07:25 PM] Steve: Listen to this crazy stat, Gary Sanchez is 5/8 against David price. All 5 hits are home runs.
[6/8/17, 9:14:04 PM] Miller: Crazy
[6/8/17, 9:14:16 PM] Miller: Terrible start for price today
[6/8/17, 9:54:59 PM] Brian Katz: That's insane for Sanchez lol, sometimes you just got a guys number
[6/9/17, 7:30:46 AM] Scott: way too small to see

[6/9/17, 7:35:00 AM] Scott: okay
[6/9/17, 7:35:25 AM] Brian Katz: Why is miller freaking out?
[6/9/17, 7:35:38 AM] Scott: @16318489683 we are missing something here.
[6/9/17, 7:36:20 AM] Brian Katz: He came into the chat hot today, just didn't get why
[6/9/17, 7:37:01 AM] Steve: It's not irrelevant!
[6/9/17, 7:37:01 AM] Miller: So I opened my ig and literally fucking the first 18 posts are from this one girl's day
[6/9/17, 7:37:04 AM] Miller: Jesus christ

[6/9/17, 7:37:22 AM] Steve: She is who Miller might have dated had he not been with nicole
[6/9/17, 7:37:26 AM] Miller: This is madness
[6/9/17, 7:37:35 AM] Steve: They were a love that could never be
[6/9/17, 7:38:33 AM] Scott: how could it never be?
[6/9/17, 7:38:51 AM] Steve: Are yo a smart guy?
[6/9/17, 7:38:57 AM] Steve: I'll let you figure it out
[6/9/17, 7:39:01 AM] Scott: b/c he was with nicole at the time?
[6/9/17, 7:39:03 AM] Scott: there could be a million reasons
[6/9/17, 7:39:04 AM] Scott: literally

[6/9/17, 7:47:08 AM] Steve: But sean may or may not be in another country
[6/9/17, 7:47:39 AM] Scott: #replacementastoriabestie
[6/9/17, 7:48:14 AM] Miller: sean is in another country? isnt he going to a wedding tonight?
[6/9/17, 7:48:23 AM] Steve: No one knows
[6/9/17, 7:55:35 AM] Brian Katz: Sean is AWOL?
[6/9/17, 7:56:31 AM] Steve: You know it's
[6/9/17, 7:56:37 AM] Steve: *it

[6/9/17, 7:59:02 AM] Steve: Rumor is she's single and ready to mingle
[6/9/17, 7:59:53 AM] Sean: Ew
[6/9/17, 8:00:25 AM] Miller: didnt they they just move to washington dc together
[6/9/17, 8:00:44 AM] Scott: as if you don't know but are asking a question....
[6/9/17, 8:01:11 AM] Steve: Exactly cheese
[6/9/17, 8:01:18 AM] Steve: Superlawyer his ass
[6/9/17, 8:01:31 AM] Steve: Also, I may or may not have done some investigating
[6/9/17, 8:02:36 AM] Miller: it was a semi-rhetorical question
[6/9/17, 8:03:04 AM] Miller: as in they were together for 5 years they just moved to another state together its surprising they broke up
[6/9/17, 8:03:23 AM] Steve: He's not in any of her pics and hasn't been for a while
[6/9/17, 8:03:40 AM] Steve: And she's been going ham on my timeline
[6/9/17, 8:03:46 AM] Steve: Well, everyone's
[6/9/17, 8:03:47 AM] Miller: yea i didnt notice until you said anything but he was not in any of those 19 from yesterday
[6/9/17, 8:04:12 AM] Steve: If you check the timeline, it's a pattern
[6/9/17, 8:04:17 AM] Steve: #detectivesteve
[6/9/17, 8:04:53 AM] Scott: #stalkersteve
[6/9/17, 8:05:12 AM] Steve: Right, because no one does what I did, ever.
[6/9/17, 8:05:13 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[6/9/17, 8:05:14 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/9/17, 8:05:16 AM] Sean: The guy that ever really liked her from kickball!!

[6/9/17, 8:05:30 AM] Steve: Yea
[6/9/17, 8:05:39 AM] Steve: They moved to D.C. Together
[6/9/17, 8:05:57 AM] Scott: @13478047760 goes through 19 pictures in her instagram, says he's "not a stalker".  psh. smh.
[6/9/17, 8:06:25 AM] Sean: Then I'm a stalker too. 19 pictures takes all of a minute to go thru
[6/9/17, 8:06:44 AM] Steve: Everyone on this chat has done that at some time or another
[6/9/17, 8:06:48 AM] Miller: also you have no choice
[6/9/17, 8:06:50 AM] Miller: its in your feed
[6/9/17, 8:06:53 AM] Steve: If you say you haven't, you're lying
[6/9/17, 8:07:10 AM] Steve: I mean, I click and check the profile pics from my timeline
[6/9/17, 8:07:29 AM] Steve: ^that was last year
[6/9/17, 8:07:38 AM] Miller: i get that
[6/9/17, 8:07:40 AM] Sean: Shared her memory bro
[6/9/17, 8:07:41 AM] Scott: üé§
[6/9/17, 8:07:43 AM] Miller: its weird to post the "memory"
[6/9/17, 8:07:45 AM] Miller: if you broke up
[6/9/17, 8:07:45 AM] Sean: From a year ago
[6/9/17, 8:07:57 AM] Steve: Ah, didn't click on the screen
[6/9/17, 8:07:59 AM] Miller: is that a thing people do?
[6/9/17, 8:08:04 AM] Steve: I don't know
[6/9/17, 8:08:06 AM] Sean: Lmao
[6/9/17, 8:08:08 AM] Sean: No
[6/9/17, 8:08:23 AM] Steve: But he's been absent for a while from pics with her
[6/9/17, 8:08:26 AM] Steve: Just weird
[6/9/17, 8:08:29 AM] Sean: Jared never really liked her. Remember during kickball he wouldn't even acknowledge her
[6/9/17, 8:08:45 AM] Miller: i agree steve there is overwhelming evidence
[6/9/17, 8:08:59 AM] Steve: Unless he just doesn't like pictures
[6/9/17, 8:09:00 AM] Miller: im sure sean thinks hes gay like he thinks everyone is
[6/9/17, 8:09:05 AM] Steve: Which could be a thing
[6/9/17, 8:09:08 AM] Sean: Lmao no he ain't
[6/9/17, 8:09:12 AM] Steve: Sean def got his number
[6/9/17, 8:09:19 AM] Miller: never used to be a problem maybe he got some new job working for the CIA or something
[6/9/17, 8:09:27 AM] Steve: Possible
[6/9/17, 8:09:27 AM] Miller: i probably have his #
[6/9/17, 8:09:32 AM] Miller: ill add him to the chat
[6/9/17, 8:09:34 AM] Sean: I never thought that but I remember thinking it was weird finding out at the end of the season they were dating and not once gave off that vibe
[6/9/17, 8:09:45 AM] Steve: I'm sure he'd love the 457 messages a day
[6/9/17, 8:10:26 AM] Miller: i don disagree but they did still move in together and then move actual states and stayed together, he probably liked her a little bit
[6/9/17, 8:10:43 AM] Steve: Yea, he def had to at that point
[6/9/17, 8:10:59 AM] Steve: Maybe they just don't take pictures together
[6/9/17, 8:11:05 AM] Steve: It's now still a mystery
[6/9/17, 8:11:22 AM] Sean: I can just message her and be like hey how you been?! How's Jared
[6/9/17, 8:11:27 AM] Scott: you know you can confirm this easily if you guys ahve a friend in common you can inquire to
[6/9/17, 8:11:34 AM] Steve: Lol

[6/9/17, 8:11:59 AM] Sean: I could also ask the gay kid mike
[6/9/17, 8:12:02 AM] Miller: lol not weird at all
[6/9/17, 8:12:04 AM] Sean: We hooked up once
[6/9/17, 8:12:38 AM] Sean: He was cousins or best friends with Jared
[6/9/17, 8:12:56 AM] Scott: how would u approach that?
[6/9/17, 8:12:56 AM] Miller: i thought he was related to priscilla
[6/9/17, 8:13:13 AM] Sean: I just start shooting the shit and ask how everyone is
[6/9/17, 8:13:15 AM] Miller: hey how you been?! How's Jared
[6/9/17, 8:13:20 AM] Sean: And then dig
[6/9/17, 8:13:43 AM] Sean: Oh I thought it was thru Jared. You may be right
[6/9/17, 8:13:54 AM] Sean: Either way the homo of the group will spill the tea
[6/9/17, 8:14:35 AM] Steve: I don't know who Priscilla is
[6/9/17, 8:16:10 AM] Miller: she was the child like one who could only kick the ball 6"
[6/9/17, 8:16:13 AM] Sean: The little skinny Spanish girl that was on the kickball team
[6/9/17, 8:16:19 AM] Sean: Long light brown hair

[6/9/17, 8:19:44 AM] Dan Watts: I'd smash
[6/9/17, 8:19:57 AM] Steve: Oh yea, she was cute
[6/9/17, 8:20:07 AM] Steve: Maybe the smaller non midget I've ever met
[6/9/17, 8:20:15 AM] Steve: *smallest
[6/9/17, 8:21:41 AM] Steve: Wasn't she also dating a gay guy?
[6/9/17, 8:38:11 AM] Sean: She dated the gay guy mike
I hooked up with before he came out
[6/9/17, 8:39:31 AM] Miller: think she was single
[6/9/17, 8:39:47 AM] Steve: So did you ever tell her Mike cheated on her with you?
[6/9/17, 8:42:37 AM] Sean: he was out at that point they stayed friends
[6/9/17, 8:42:53 AM] Sean: She was single during kickball
[6/9/17, 8:44:41 AM] Steve: Has anyone seen her since then?
[6/9/17, 8:47:09 AM] Sean: Nope
[6/9/17, 10:53:20 AM] Kiyoon: see now this is a more enjoyable 200 messages to read than Herman and Scott arguing about white priviledge
[6/9/17, 10:53:33 AM] Kiyoon: anyone know where in DC they moved to?  I can go scope it out
[6/9/17, 10:53:56 AM] Steve: Kiyoon volunteering to literally creep

 taylor swift puts her discography back on spotify and discounts all her albums on katy perry's album release day
[6/9/17, 11:16:37 AM] Miller: lol i respect that level of pettiness
[6/9/17, 11:17:35 AM] Steve: Pretty sure she could shit on your desk and you'd still defend her
[6/9/17, 11:17:44 AM] Miller: probably
[6/9/17, 11:18:27 AM] Donk: forget the desk, she could just straight shit on his chest and he'd still defend her
[6/9/17, 11:18:49 AM] Steve: @19732079889, get out of my head
[6/9/17, 11:19:25 AM] Donk: that being said, i do respect that she took on spotify/steaming services and held firm until they caved
[6/9/17, 11:19:37 AM] Miller: on the downside it is a big blow to MillerTunes‚Ñ¢ which was previously the only streaming service where her music was still available
[6/9/17, 11:19:44 AM] Steve: Fuck Taylor swift and her pettiness
[6/9/17, 11:19:48 AM] Miller: might have to pull the IPO

[6/9/17, 12:12:43 PM] Scott: LaVar also went into the approach he took with his sons into fostering a respectful relationship with their mother when they were younger.

"I told them, 'If you're going to be disrespectful to your mom, I want you to be all the time.' So, excuse my language right here, but if you want to say, 'Good morning, b----,' that's fine with me," LaVar said. "I'm not going to say nothing. If you want to call your mom a b----, that's fine. But don't get sick, when your stomach is hurting and you want me to care for you because you know I ain't. ... She'll clean up the throw-up, the s---, whatever. She'll take of what you want ... So don't wait until you need something, or you need her to make you something and now you want to be nice to her. ...
[6/9/17, 12:14:39 PM] Scott: ‚Ä¢ Ball maintains Michael Jordan would only score two points if they played one-on-one. "13-2, He got two -- and only reason I give him two is cause he's Jordan. He's too little, too little to guard me."

[6/9/17, 2:20:50 PM] Steve: It would be closer than the series has been lol
[6/9/17, 2:21:27 PM] Kiyoon: think the former wins 4-2
[6/9/17, 2:21:30 PM] Kiyoon: in a best of 7
[6/9/17, 2:21:33 PM] Miller: more interesting would be KD/klay/steph vs lebron/irving/deandre
[6/9/17, 2:21:55 PM] Miller: love just not a traditional big man but would be interesting to see KD try to guard a real center in the post
[6/9/17, 2:22:23 PM] Donk: i would think lebron would win either one actually
[6/9/17, 2:22:28 PM] Kiyoon: you think DeAndre can guard KD/Klay or Steph though?
[6/9/17, 2:22:31 PM] Donk: irving and lebron would be great 3 on 3 players
[6/9/17, 2:23:38 PM] Miller: who would win though jordan/pippen/bill wennington vs lavar/lamelo/lonzo
[6/9/17, 2:23:59 PM] Donk: lavar lavar lavar lavar lavar
[6/9/17, 2:25:29 PM] Launchpad: 5 greatest basketball players of all time
[6/9/17, 2:25:47 PM] Steve: Not that it would ever happen but would love to see lonzo drop out of the top 10
[6/9/17, 2:25:55 PM] Miller: why
[6/9/17, 2:25:58 PM] Steve: And his father flip his shit
[6/9/17, 2:26:02 PM] Miller: id love him to drop to the knicks at 8
[6/9/17, 2:26:20 PM] Miller: why you hating on a 20 year old child
[6/9/17, 2:26:32 PM] Steve: Said no one ever about a 20 year old
[6/9/17, 2:26:49 PM] Miller: poor guy has to already deal w/his dad being lavar ball
[6/9/17, 2:26:55 PM] Steve: And I'm hating because he's probably like his father
[6/9/17, 2:26:56 PM] Launchpad: supposedly the kid is a decent human being, its just his dad thats the loudmouth
[6/9/17, 2:27:06 PM] Steve: Who I don't like very much
[6/9/17, 2:27:16 PM] Steve: I don't even care if your a loudmouth
[6/9/17, 2:27:20 PM] Steve: That's not the issue
[6/9/17, 2:27:31 PM] Steve: He's just not on the same planet as the rest of us
[6/9/17, 2:27:31 PM] Miller: stay in your lane steve
[6/9/17, 2:27:39 PM] Miller: dont make lavar ball come wreck you in a game of 1-1
[6/9/17, 2:27:55 PM] Steve: I'm sure he can
[6/9/17, 2:28:07 PM] Miller: rumor has it if you say his name 3 times in a mirror he will come shoot a 3 in your eye
[6/9/17, 2:28:16 PM] Steve: He did play in the NBA and averaged 2 points a gam
[6/9/17, 2:28:31 PM] Steve: Just did it, nothing.
[6/9/17, 2:28:39 PM] Steve: Come see me lavar!!!
[6/9/17, 2:28:43 PM] Steve: Come see me!!!
[6/9/17, 2:29:04 PM] Steve: He looks like he ate his three sons
[6/9/17, 2:29:06 PM] Miller: i cant tell if he lost like 200lbs since this video or he started wearing much bigger clothes
[6/9/17, 2:40:41 PM] Donk: lavar didnt play in the nba, he averaged 2pts per game in college
[6/9/17, 2:42:31 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/9/17, 2:42:35 PM] Steve: That's even better
[6/9/17, 2:43:45 PM] Donk: also, i dont get hating on lavar ball for being a loudmouth
[6/9/17, 2:43:50 PM] Miller: i thought he played in europe?
[6/9/17, 2:43:54 PM] Donk: him being a loudmouth is the best part
[6/9/17, 2:44:09 PM] Launchpad: its entertaining - im kind of a fan
[6/9/17, 2:44:17 PM] Donk: exactly
[6/9/17, 2:44:31 PM] Launchpad: its like cash me outsides but less harmful to society
[6/9/17, 2:45:32 PM] Steve: No one is hating on him being a loudmouth
[6/9/17, 2:45:32 PM] Donk: also, in the end, he did raise 3 kids who will all be getting d1 scholarships, and he clearly cares about his kids (even if hes completly over the top and kinda crazy)
[6/9/17, 2:45:38 PM] Steve: at least no one here
[6/9/17, 2:46:07 PM] Launchpad: not to mention hes an entreprenuer
[6/9/17, 5:24:30 PM] Launchpad: I saw Get Out last night
[6/9/17, 5:24:52 PM] Launchpad: pretty good, but I don't think its worthy of its 99% tomatoes
[6/9/17, 5:24:53 PM] Miller: Def hated it
[6/9/17, 5:25:14 PM] Miller: Made you feel guilty for being white
[6/9/17, 5:25:16 PM] Launchpad: lol no you guys would think I hate it because you probably assume I'm racist
[6/9/17, 5:25:20 PM] Miller: 0 stars
[6/9/17, 5:26:09 PM] Launchpad: I basically thought it was like nearly every other horror movie, but with a new angle
[6/9/17, 5:28:25 PM] Miller: How dare you make assumptions about our assumptions
[6/9/17, 6:33:50 PM] Brian Katz: It was overrated, the ending had no suspense
[6/9/17, 6:34:01 PM] Brian Katz: Also very predictable on what was happening
[6/9/17, 6:47:26 PM] Launchpad: "Take me to Mexico"
[6/9/17, 6:47:29 PM] Launchpad: garbage
[6/9/17, 6:47:45 PM] Launchpad: $5 margs ok
[6/9/17, 8:03:23 PM] Miller: Can you really know you're gay at that age?
[6/9/17, 10:29:07 PM] Steve: With that tude, def.
[6/9/17, 10:30:14 PM] Miller: Wait is that you?
[6/9/17, 10:30:20 PM] Miller: Nicole says that's definitely you
[6/9/17, 10:30:30 PM] Miller: The rest of us are skeptical
[6/9/17, 10:45:41 PM] Launchpad: Miller at an EDM show?? ü§ò
[6/9/17, 10:57:22 PM] Kiyoon: Chainsmokers so mainstream
[6/9/17, 10:58:25 PM] Brian Katz: Show was dope
[6/9/17, 10:58:33 PM] Brian Katz: Quit hating Kiyoon
[6/9/17, 11:07:06 PM] Steve: How you like that picture cheese
[6/9/17, 11:07:52 PM] Miller: Is it you or not?
[6/9/17, 11:19:53 PM] Kiyoon: Fine it looks cool I can't hate on any edm show
[6/9/17, 11:20:04 PM] Kiyoon: Katz, you confident the Warriors winning tonight????
[6/9/17, 11:20:55 PM] Miller: If they manage to come back and win it was never in doubt üòÇ
[6/9/17, 11:21:45 PM] Brian Katz: #truth miller
[6/9/17, 11:30:03 PM] Kiyoon: Got him!
[6/9/17, 11:30:16 PM] Kiyoon: Social media never forgets
[6/9/17, 11:36:41 PM] Tk: I hope Cavs dont blow this
[6/10/17, 1:19:30 AM] Steve: Oh I wore the same suit
[6/10/17, 1:19:35 AM] Steve: Always
[6/10/17, 1:52:01 PM] Scott: Haha that's great
[6/10/17, 3:48:57 PM] Brian Katz: Damn, not since hit me up has someone gotten roasted so hard lol
[6/11/17, 10:20:05 AM] Miller: https://www.viralthread.com/horrific-footage-shows-seriously-damaging-effects-long-term-cocaine-use/?utm_source=vt&utm_medium=junglecreations&utm_campaign=post
[6/11/17, 10:20:38 AM] Miller: Was originally gonna @16318489683 when I started but after reading it "Chest pain that feels like a heart attack is common and sends many cocaine users to the emergency room" had to @19732079889
[6/11/17, 12:48:02 PM] Scott: Is he smart enough to realize that's what he is insinuating ?
[6/11/17, 7:01:25 PM] Steve: So, can we talk about Aaron Judge now?
[6/11/17, 7:27:12 PM] Dan Watts: üíâüíäüíâüíäüíâ
[6/12/17, 9:42:26 AM] Miller: Those who wanted to watch viral star Danielle Bregoli ‚Äúvibing to some records‚Äù and doing little else onstage are more shit out of luck than they previously indicated: The 14-year-old‚Äôs manager Adam Kluger told Billboard that her two-date tour scheduled for July has been postponed. Reports Billboard:

‚ÄúWe have some very interesting initiatives for Danielle that we hope to announce soon,‚Äù Kluger tells Billboard, explaining the decision ‚Äúto pull the shows the day before tickets went on sale‚Äù and focus on a larger, yet-to-be announced project.
[6/12/17, 9:42:31 AM] Miller: better luck next time @16195657200
[6/12/17, 9:43:06 AM] Miller: maybe you can cash her on her next epic to-be-announced 3 date worldwide tour
[6/12/17, 9:44:36 AM] Donk: yeah, dont think you can call it a tour with only two dates
[6/12/17, 9:58:36 AM] Steve: @19732079889, you ok after this weekend?
[6/12/17, 9:59:18 AM] Donk: careful, you are veering dangerously close to celebrating regular season victories
[6/12/17, 9:59:24 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/12/17, 9:59:25 AM] Donk: those are allowed under steve rules
[6/12/17, 9:59:30 AM] Steve: I'm just making sure you are ok
[6/12/17, 9:59:34 AM] Donk: arent allowed i mean
[6/12/17, 9:59:35 AM] Steve: It was a rough one
[6/12/17, 10:00:26 AM] Donk: good news is that runs dont carry over to the next game/series
[6/12/17, 10:01:14 AM] Steve: I honestly thought Baltimore had better pitching
[6/12/17, 10:01:21 AM] Steve: You think they make a deal at the deadline?
[6/12/17, 10:01:57 AM] Donk: it was one series, i dont think you blow up the team because you lose 3 games
[6/12/17, 10:01:59 AM] Donk: but maybe
[6/12/17, 10:02:05 AM] Donk: depends on who is availible
[6/12/17, 10:02:30 AM] Steve: But even when they faced them in Baltimore they had lost like 6-7 straight before the series
[6/12/17, 10:02:31 AM] Brian Katz: The yanks kicked the shit out of Baltimore this weekend.
[6/12/17, 10:02:36 AM] Steve: And I'm not saying blow up the team
[6/12/17, 10:02:44 AM] Steve: I'm saying adding needed pieces
[6/12/17, 10:02:52 AM] Steve: Doesn't help that Britton is out either
[6/12/17, 10:02:55 AM] Donk: getting the bullpen healthy is the first step
[6/12/17, 10:02:58 AM] Donk: and oday
[6/12/17, 10:03:28 AM] Scott: Brach has been good
[6/12/17, 10:03:34 AM] Scott: As a stop gap
[6/12/17, 10:03:42 AM] Brian Katz: Baltimore should tear down their stadium, bunch of losers lol
[6/12/17, 10:04:22 AM] Donk: yankees fans still mad that citifield is way better than new yankee stadium?
[6/12/17, 10:04:31 AM] Donk: so they want to tear down camden?
[6/12/17, 10:04:32 AM] Steve: Not at all
[6/12/17, 10:04:38 AM] Steve: Most recognize it
[6/12/17, 10:06:39 AM] Brian Katz: The better baseball is played in the Bronx.
[6/12/17, 10:07:05 AM] Brian Katz: Also Yankee stadium the new one has more banners as well
[6/12/17, 10:07:39 AM] Steve: And Camden is also much nice than Yankee stadium
[6/12/17, 10:07:42 AM] Brian Katz: I'm pretty sure it has more banners than Camden yard to, which has been around for 20 years right?
[6/12/17, 10:08:11 AM] Donk: katz's analysis always come down to 2 things on baseball
[6/12/17, 10:08:16 AM] Donk: 1) your team "stinks"
[6/12/17, 10:08:23 AM] Donk: and 2) the yankees won a whole bunch in the past!
[6/12/17, 10:08:24 AM] Brian Katz: That's true
[6/12/17, 10:08:31 AM] Brian Katz: And currently
[6/12/17, 10:08:36 AM] Steve: Oh katz, you make us yankee fans get a stereotype that we can shake off
[6/12/17, 10:08:42 AM] Steve: You're hurting the cause brah!
[6/12/17, 10:08:51 AM] Steve: They won't respect our baseball knowledge!
[6/12/17, 10:09:32 AM] Brian Katz: I don't care about that. Oh Yankee fans only care about winning. I'm fine with that. I'll leave the good efforts to Baltimore
[6/12/17, 10:10:34 AM] Donk: thats fine, but its basically at the same level as any bandwagon fan who can name like 2 players on the team since jeter and rivera retired
[6/12/17, 10:11:32 AM] Brian Katz: I can name you my team Donk
[6/12/17, 10:12:25 AM] Brian Katz: I'm actually doing great in hermans league because I believed in the Yankees pitching staff
[6/12/17, 10:12:54 AM] Steve: Severino and Pineda?
[6/12/17, 10:12:57 AM] Brian Katz: I balled on judge in that league cause I didn't need anymore outfielders. Mistake
[6/12/17, 10:12:59 AM] Brian Katz: Yup
[6/12/17, 10:13:21 AM] Steve: Well no one knew judge would be this
[6/12/17, 10:13:22 AM] Brian Katz: And betances
[6/12/17, 10:13:24 AM] Steve: So...
[6/12/17, 10:13:31 AM] Brian Katz: I have in my other leagues
[6/12/17, 10:14:01 AM] Steve: But this still has nothing to do with bringing up past championships
[6/12/17, 10:14:11 AM] Brian Katz: I picked him up when I heard he was starting. I'm annoyed that I had so many outfielders
[6/12/17, 10:14:17 AM] Brian Katz: 2009
[6/12/17, 10:14:20 AM] Brian Katz: Woo woo
[6/12/17, 10:15:46 AM] Steve: Good times
[6/12/17, 10:15:49 AM] Steve: Tia!!!!!
[6/12/17, 10:15:54 AM] Steve: And liz

[6/12/17, 10:17:00 AM] Donk: great times! i bet you guys had so much fun!
[6/12/17, 10:17:21 AM] Brian Katz: I'm sure the giant and dodger fans of that time were salty too
[6/12/17, 10:17:40 AM] Donk: herman does look made young in that photo
[6/12/17, 10:18:02 AM] Brian Katz: You see the sub headline!?!

[6/12/17, 10:18:16 AM] Donk: dangerous time to be alive lol
[6/12/17, 10:18:45 AM] Donk: so many negative headlines
[6/12/17, 10:18:53 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[6/12/17, 10:19:01 AM] Brian Katz: Yanks win, two dead
[6/12/17, 10:19:34 AM] Donk: also coal strikes, robbers getting prison time, bodies int he park, war on indians
[6/12/17, 10:19:37 AM] Brian Katz: Also plan war on Indians in Mexico
[6/12/17, 10:19:47 AM] Donk: and so politically in correct, its native americans!
[6/12/17, 10:20:00 AM] Donk: (or in this case, native mexicans)
[6/12/17, 10:20:11 AM] Brian Katz: You're lucky they weren't referred to as engines
[6/12/17, 10:20:28 AM] Donk: thats a great autocorrect
[6/12/17, 10:20:31 AM] Brian Katz: Or redskins

[6/13/17, 5:20:46 AM] Brian Katz: It'd be a lot closer
[6/13/17, 7:31:10 AM] Steve: Lebron was just stat padding
[6/13/17, 7:31:16 AM] Steve: Wouldn't be close either way
[6/13/17, 7:31:21 AM] Steve: #durantmvp
[6/13/17, 7:32:01 AM] Scott: #wandaistherealmvp
[6/13/17, 7:54:47 AM] Miller: I didn't stay up but I'm assuming LeBron won the mvp? He averaged 2 numbers in 3 things so idk what else matters
[6/13/17, 7:56:50 AM] Steve: Noooo just stat padding
[6/13/17, 7:56:58 AM] Steve: That's what the commissioner announced
[6/13/17, 7:57:13 AM] Scott: Commissioner steve?
[6/13/17, 7:58:33 AM] Steve: Triple doubles have now been named stat passers
[6/13/17, 8:08:45 AM] Miller: Love how as usual their is not only visual evidence of Westbrook stat padding but respected professional nba analyst and writers who share that opinion and then on the other side is steve who watched 2 thunder games and 30 seconds of Westbrook sportscenter highlights
[6/13/17, 8:08:52 AM] Miller: I'm sure you're probably right
[6/13/17, 8:09:58 AM] Steve: *padders
[6/13/17, 8:10:22 AM] Steve: #statpadders
[6/13/17, 8:12:57 AM] Brian Katz: Aaron judge is stat padding too, same with Tom Brady.
[6/13/17, 8:14:38 AM] Steve: Absolutely
[6/13/17, 8:15:01 AM] Steve: Don't forget Rafa nadal #espa√±a
[6/13/17, 8:22:34 AM] Miller: Another qualified opinion from a guy who probably watched even less of Westbrook
[6/13/17, 8:22:52 AM] Miller: The new arrogant donks

[6/13/17, 12:46:41 PM] Dan Watts: Of course Shaun King is tweeting this as fact as well and already declaring them the most woke team in the NBA
[6/13/17, 12:47:19 PM] Miller: would be surprising if any team ever unanimously skipped it, guess well see
[6/13/17, 12:51:05 PM] Dan Watts: Does Shaun King have any journalistic ethics at all?
[6/13/17, 12:51:39 PM] Miller: http://www.ajc.com/sports/warriors-unanimously-decline-white-house-visit-per-reports/i7uecqAhFfD8e2pj8KAqKK/
[6/13/17, 12:51:40 PM] Miller: not just him
[6/13/17, 12:52:00 PM] Miller: its the better-to-be-first-than-right world we live in with the media and twitter these days
[6/13/17, 12:52:08 PM] Donk: is shaun king a journalist or a blogger? i thought he just did opinion based stuff, not actually going out and reporting on things
[6/13/17, 12:52:30 PM] Miller: tweet something that may or may not be right, if its right, you are FIRST and get the credit, if its not, well who cares people move on and you blame your sauces
[6/13/17, 12:52:31 PM] Dan Watts: He writes for daily news
[6/13/17, 12:52:53 PM] Miller: kind of like how i broke the lebron going back to CLE story 3 years before it happened
[6/13/17, 12:59:47 PM] Justin: lp might be time to sell

[6/13/17, 1:03:08 PM] Steve: Also it's being reported my multiple outlets
[6/13/17, 1:03:12 PM] Steve: Not just Shaun king
[6/13/17, 1:03:20 PM] Justin: shaun king is now an investigative journalist for tyt i think
[6/13/17, 1:03:28 PM] Justin: pretty sure they hired him
[6/13/17, 1:04:51 PM] Miller: if you get hired as an investigative journalist by a facebook page does that count?
[6/13/17, 1:04:55 PM] Justin: and damn all this shaun king hate, wtf watts.  oh no some guy constantly talking and referring to racist elements in society, exaggerated or not who gives a shit?
[6/13/17, 1:05:58 PM] Justin: well i can refute that if you would really like

[6/13/17, 1:07:10 PM] Dan Watts: This is the definition of fake news
[6/13/17, 1:07:23 PM] Justin: I mean CNN  sure as fuck doesnt do investigative journalism anymore, its mostly places like the guardian, intercept, rolling sotne  etc that do it
[6/13/17, 1:08:07 PM] Justin: CNN brings you breaking news about the kardashians twice daily
[6/13/17, 1:08:25 PM] Dan Watts: Did I say CNN is good?

[6/13/17, 1:11:50 PM] Dan Watts: You made this up

[6/13/17, 1:12:19 PM] Justin: verifiable?
[6/13/17, 1:12:22 PM] Steve: Just because you don't like him doesn't mean he is spreading fake news
[6/13/17, 1:12:28 PM] Steve: Or don't like his ideas

[6/13/17, 1:13:24 PM] Steve: Only by the NY Daily watts
[6/13/17, 1:13:36 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.snopes.com/warriors-white-house-visit/
[6/13/17, 1:14:23 PM] Justin: fair
[6/13/17, 1:14:34 PM] Justin: so one tweet sparked another
[6/13/17, 1:14:39 PM] Steve: Then many people are reporting fake news
[6/13/17, 1:14:46 PM] Dan Watts: I don't disagree with that
[6/13/17, 1:14:49 PM] Steve: Because I've seen it on a bunch of sites
[6/13/17, 1:15:02 PM] Dan Watts: But Shaun king is guilty of this

[6/13/17, 1:26:44 PM] Justin: well done, almost got away with it
[6/13/17, 1:37:10 PM] Dan Watts: What it's not possible he took it down? I looked at his page he retweeted that unconfirmed tweet
[6/13/17, 1:37:58 PM] Dan Watts: He's also tweeting Megyn Kelly embodies white surpremacy
[6/13/17, 1:39:03 PM] Dan Watts: I can't stand her but that's a ridiculous thing to say
[6/13/17, 2:34:12 PM] Dan Watts: http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/02/15/shaun-king-doubles-down-in-his-crusade-against-peyton-manning/

[6/13/17, 2:38:45 PM] Donk: that article about shaun king's take on peyton is more than a year old lol
[6/13/17, 2:39:05 PM] Miller: herman hack your phone or something?
[6/13/17, 2:39:45 PM] Donk: watts is on a mission to decredit him, going back into the archives to dig up stuff
[6/13/17, 2:39:56 PM] Dan Watts: archives? 1 year ago
[6/13/17, 2:40:16 PM] Miller: well watts was just hired as an investigative journalist by the equally-accredit new group‚Ñ¢
[6/13/17, 2:40:18 PM] Donk: 15 months, thats archives
[6/13/17, 2:40:33 PM] Donk: 14 months even
[6/13/17, 2:40:40 PM] Miller: we're one facebook show away from being a reputable news source
[6/13/17, 2:41:33 PM] Miller: the old betas? doesnt quite have the same ring, not a bad start tbh
[6/13/17, 2:41:44 PM] Donk: TyW - The Young Watts
[6/13/17, 2:42:29 PM] Dan Watts: so because he put out a fake news hackjob article 14 months ago, he's reputable? i don't get it
[6/13/17, 2:42:59 PM] Dan Watts: TyW- The Young Watts has a nice ring to it I must say
[6/13/17, 2:43:15 PM] Donk: im just amused by the crusade
[6/13/17, 2:43:31 PM] Donk: thats the 3rd article/tweet that you have posted to hate on in the last 24 hours
[6/13/17, 2:43:31 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTz5xjmso4 b/w this and his superbowl ring i think he has some cred
[6/13/17, 2:45:40 PM] Donk: crazy how old looking up Shaun King's stats made me feel. hes only 40, and i was like damn, i felt like he played 20 years ago...and then i realized it was basically 20 years ago
[6/13/17, 2:45:49 PM] Donk: (QB Shaun King that is obviouslY)
[6/13/17, 2:46:03 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.reddit.com/r/Prematurecelebration/comments/5sdsoe/shaun_king_on_the_superbowl_he_deleted_this_tweet/

[6/13/17, 3:58:36 PM] Dan Watts: lmfao this guy is SO FULL OF SHIT - he's a warriors fan now, and has contacts within the organization?!?!?
[6/13/17, 4:59:26 PM] Justin: more pressing, why is the NY post publishing an article on an opinion based on tweet about a hypothetical situation in which a sports team may or may not accept a potential whitehouse invitation, instead of covering actual news?
[6/13/17, 5:24:46 PM] Miller: I'm still sad we never got to see the original

[6/13/17, 10:42:17 PM] Steve: No one would watch it, stick to your day jobs.
[6/13/17, 10:42:59 PM] Steve: It wouldn't even leave pilot stage like Bernie never left the primaries

[6/13/17, 11:04:49 PM] Launchpad: Mr Robot.  You know hes crazy -- he wakes up one episode in a sitcom
[6/13/17, 11:05:10 PM] Launchpad: Its California I do anything I want high

[6/13/17, 11:24:54 PM] Steve: Get more weed stocks
[6/13/17, 11:40:41 PM] Launchpad: Will do üëç
[6/14/17, 7:51:22 AM] Steve: Just different stages in his life. The former was a rough patch where he was obviously cheating and had a possible breakup. 2017 - he's just putting out bangers with other artists and collecting checks smiling.
[6/14/17, 8:01:22 AM] Steve: https://youtu.be/BFVVvVLMr-E

[6/14/17, 10:31:38 AM] Miller: It's lit?
[6/14/17, 10:31:46 AM] Donk: and its a total clickbait headline
[6/14/17, 10:32:18 AM] Launchpad: oops yeah your right the headline is garbage
[6/14/17, 10:32:57 AM] Launchpad: basically new Secret Service recruits under 24 are allowed to have smoked pot in the past, just not in the last 12 months
[6/14/17, 10:33:06 AM] Miller: Obviously cheating? Did you miss the whole point of the song? It wasn't him! üòÇ
[6/14/17, 10:35:31 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[6/14/17, 10:35:55 AM] Brian Katz: It definitely wasn't him
[6/14/17, 10:42:28 AM] Steve: Riiiiiiight
[6/14/17, 11:10:18 AM] Steve: Oh man, the Virginia shooter was a Bernie bro
[6/14/17, 11:11:51 AM] Justin: Lol
[6/14/17, 11:11:55 AM] Launchpad: he did not check his privilege at the door
[6/14/17, 11:13:17 AM] Justin: More likely he looked himself in mirror
[6/14/17, 11:14:07 AM] Justin: If true. Thank god guy isn't Muslim

[6/14/17, 11:36:48 AM] Steve: And don't have better gun control
[6/14/17, 11:37:30 AM] Launchpad: bad news guys, Im getting sued by the IRS
[6/14/17, 11:37:42 AM] Launchpad: at least thats what the voicemail I got just told me
[6/14/17, 11:37:54 AM] Justin: lol miller trying to get you
[6/14/17, 11:38:11 AM] Launchpad: its definitely not Miller
[6/14/17, 11:38:13 AM] Launchpad: its a known scam
[6/14/17, 11:38:33 AM] Launchpad: the funny part is that the message was left by a 'text-to-speech' reader from like 2005
[6/14/17, 11:38:56 AM] Steve: It is a definite scam
[6/14/17, 11:39:04 AM] Launchpad: my disc golf application speaks better than that
[6/14/17, 11:39:06 AM] Steve: But if not, sell the btcpin stocks first
[6/14/17, 11:39:14 AM] Steve: *bitcoin
[6/14/17, 11:41:17 AM] Justin: that was quickest trump speech ever
[6/14/17, 11:45:39 AM] Steve: What did he say?
[6/14/17, 11:46:16 AM] Justin: actually reasonable 3 minutes of condolence
[6/14/17, 11:46:40 AM] Steve: Well it was a republican congressman
[6/14/17, 11:47:15 AM] Steve: Has he still not brought up the workplace shooting or the crazed maniac that killed two people because they defended immigrants?
[6/14/17, 11:50:44 AM] Miller: The irs never calls anyone, ever
[6/14/17, 11:50:49 AM] Miller: Something to keep in mind
[6/14/17, 11:51:55 AM] Launchpad: and they probably don't just sue people right off the bat...
[6/14/17, 11:52:15 AM] Launchpad: or use ghetto text-to-speech editors.  It sounded like she was reading a ransom note
[6/14/17, 11:53:16 AM] Donk: yeah the IRS just blankets people in notices instead
[6/14/17, 11:57:24 AM] Launchpad: why would they sue you when they could just demand that you pay them
[6/14/17, 11:57:54 AM] Justin: also trump didnt clal it terrorism
[6/14/17, 11:59:09 AM] Justin: my aunts brother in law got me with a phonecall like that once.... I went down to florida to set upo poekr account and he started asking why i was opening said bank account etc etc
[6/14/17, 11:59:29 AM] Justin: pretending to be form the irs

[6/14/17, 12:23:33 PM] Miller: Watch both of those lp

[6/14/17, 12:25:58 PM] Launchpad: he watches Teen Mom cause his gfs friend is on it ;)

[6/14/17, 12:30:55 PM] Steve: OITNB
[6/14/17, 12:31:58 PM] Donk: i really enjoyed the first season of Sense8, but havent watched the 2nd season yet

[6/14/17, 12:32:22 PM] Justin: didnt they cancel that?
[6/14/17, 12:32:24 PM] Justin: sense 8
[6/14/17, 12:32:38 PM] Miller: Nicole watches teen mom og, I can't deal with that shit and I watch a lot of crap
[6/14/17, 12:33:05 PM] Donk: they did cancel sense8, at least of now
[6/14/17, 12:33:09 PM] Launchpad: theres too much good tv on to be watching that kind of garbage
[6/14/17, 12:33:54 PM] Donk: its cheese, after teen mom ends he probably watches lil yachty music videos
[6/14/17, 12:36:31 PM] Launchpad: Sneaky Pete is a good show on Amazon
[6/14/17, 12:36:50 PM] Launchpad: Bryan Cranston produces and he is the main villain
[6/14/17, 12:37:14 PM] Miller: Yachty flopped hard
[6/14/17, 12:37:25 PM] Miller: Hope he figures out if he has a 360 deal or not
[6/14/17, 12:38:17 PM] Justin: i watched the preview for sneaky pete, liked it.  Never watched it when it got picked up
[6/14/17, 12:49:29 PM] Justin: https://youtu.be/4iw1jTY-X3A
[6/14/17, 12:50:37 PM] Donk: vince vaughn looking really old
[6/14/17, 1:26:36 PM] Justin: https://www.rt.com/usa/392284-san-francisco-ups-shooting/
[6/14/17, 1:26:39 PM] Justin: 2 in one day
[6/14/17, 1:26:52 PM] Justin: once again hoping hes not brown
[6/14/17, 1:27:08 PM] Justin: although at this point.... maybe its time to recnongize hes usually white and not a muslim
[6/14/17, 1:28:17 PM] Justin: makes sense
[6/14/17, 1:28:26 PM] Kiyoon: brah where do you have meetings
[6/14/17, 1:28:31 PM] Justin: assuming your at a banking conference
[6/14/17, 1:28:41 PM] Miller: Hotels usually
[6/14/17, 1:29:08 PM] Miller: Only 2nd time I've ever seen a protestor last one was like 9 years ago during the crisis
[6/14/17, 1:35:34 PM] Steve: Keep fighting!
[6/14/17, 1:35:39 PM] Steve: Fuck that pipeline
[6/14/17, 1:39:30 PM] Donk: https://theringer.com/ringer-midyear-tv-awards-alexis-bledel-the-leftovers-master-of-none-better-call-saul-3c78651735c0
[6/14/17, 1:39:41 PM] Donk: just pulled up that article to read during lunch, and first show they mention was sneaky pete
[6/14/17, 1:41:33 PM] Miller: I enjoyed the leftovers in spite of it being the weirdest show in the world
[6/14/17, 1:41:58 PM] Launchpad: funny the second show it mentions is the Handmaids Tale which I was going to mention
[6/14/17, 1:42:03 PM] Launchpad: I haven't seen it but heard its awesome
[6/14/17, 1:42:16 PM] Donk: liz liked the leftovers, but i gave up on it after season 1
[6/14/17, 1:42:29 PM] Miller: Season 2 was million times better
[6/14/17, 1:42:30 PM] Donk: she also loves handmaids tale, but i havent seen any of it
[6/14/17, 1:42:46 PM] Miller: Season 3 was somewhere in between
[6/14/17, 1:43:37 PM] Launchpad: and my brother says Brockmire is hilarious
[6/14/17, 1:44:11 PM] Miller: I also forgot I have watched vice principals for whoever recommended that
[6/14/17, 1:44:12 PM] Donk: has anyone watched american gods yet? ive been hearing good things but im one of the rare people who did not like the book
[6/14/17, 1:44:17 PM] Miller: I knew it sounded familiar
[6/14/17, 1:44:33 PM] Miller: I'll watch anything Danny Mcbride
[6/14/17, 1:45:02 PM] Donk: he was remarkebly subdued in the new alien movies, which was a fun time, if not the greatest movie
[6/14/17, 1:45:35 PM] Launchpad: never heard of American Gods but this dick kicking scene it quite something
[6/14/17, 1:45:36 PM] Miller: The prometheus sequel?
[6/14/17, 1:45:57 PM] Donk: yeah
[6/14/17, 1:46:17 PM] Launchpad: I would also like the nominate the guy who got his dick bit off while getting head from a deadite on Ash Vs. Evil dead for most gruesome death
[6/14/17, 1:46:43 PM] Justin: pct women vs men graduating with degrees in science fields
[6/14/17, 1:46:48 PM] Justin: ....gender gap
[6/14/17, 1:48:10 PM] Launchpad: clearly this is the fault of Google, Apple, and Microsoft for not doing enough
[6/14/17, 1:48:46 PM] Justin: mmore data obviously needed to blame google
[6/14/17, 1:49:15 PM] Justin: pretty clear it exists though, for whatever reasons
[6/14/17, 1:54:13 PM] Justin: interesting is almost across the board there is a drop after 2000 ot a degree, i blame millenials
[6/14/17, 1:54:40 PM] Miller: ill need a graph of the race/gender of people graduating from NFL Head Coach schedule
[6/14/17, 1:55:43 PM] Miller: *school
[6/14/17, 1:57:17 PM] Launchpad: the chart herman posted is disturbing for one reason.  Girls are winning biology and they must be stopped
[6/14/17, 2:17:35 PM] Justin: seriously first its the women, than its the mexicans, gotta stomp that out as its root
[6/14/17, 2:19:49 PM] Launchpad: mexicans don't do biology, they do chemistry ‚öó
[6/14/17, 5:35:25 PM] Justin: @17189742074 how you miss this one http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/king-don-blame-sanders-congressional-baseball-shooting-article-1.3247576
[6/14/17, 5:35:53 PM] Justin: i 2nd miller
[6/14/17, 5:36:32 PM] Miller: i will say some of the anti-trump media stuff probably isnt great in terms of fueling that shit
[6/14/17, 5:37:25 PM] Justin: no doubt, doesnt make it any less rela for people thoguh
[6/14/17, 5:37:24 PM] Brian Katz: Is that a man or woman?
[6/14/17, 5:37:30 PM] Miller: theres crazy people on both sides and access to guns is super easy
[6/14/17, 5:37:58 PM] Justin: i mean less focus on russia more focus on terrible policy would be nice, but thats unrealistic
[6/14/17, 5:38:01 PM] Steve: Yea both sides fuel it
[6/14/17, 5:38:12 PM] Steve: In some way
[6/14/17, 5:38:23 PM] Steve: But it's he lack of gun control in this country that is the real issue
[6/14/17, 5:38:33 PM] Justin: yeh you cant draw a flase equivalaence either
[6/14/17, 5:38:39 PM] Miller: oh i can, watch
[6/14/17, 5:38:47 PM] Justin: well you did, thats true
[6/14/17, 5:38:55 PM] Justin: but yes clearly there are craizies everywhere
[6/14/17, 5:39:20 PM] Miller: on the plus side at least these guys all have access to good healthcare
[6/14/17, 5:39:21 PM] Miller: too soon?
[6/14/17, 5:39:35 PM] Justin: lol
[6/14/17, 5:39:44 PM] Justin: idk if staffers do though
[6/14/17, 5:40:22 PM] Steve: Yes they do
[6/14/17, 5:40:29 PM] Justin: was reading interesting article in i think forbes other day about how most gofundme campaigns are medical cost driven cmapigns
[6/14/17, 5:40:28 PM] Steve: Every single one of them
[6/14/17, 5:40:32 PM] Steve: And their families
[6/14/17, 5:40:45 PM] Steve: Makes sense
[6/14/17, 5:40:51 PM] Steve: Or funerals
[6/14/17, 5:40:56 PM] Steve: Which are dumb expensive
[6/14/17, 5:41:00 PM] Justin: something like 80% funds riased on those sites are for medical emergencies
[6/14/17, 5:41:22 PM] Steve: I think the average price of a funeral is like 8k
[6/14/17, 5:41:39 PM] Dan Watts: is anyone legitimately blaming bernie for these shootings? or is shaun king creating a fake controversy again????
[6/14/17, 5:42:00 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.complex.com/life/2016/01/shaun-king-black-lives-matter/
[6/14/17, 5:42:06 PM] Dan Watts: FRAUD!!!
[6/14/17, 5:43:13 PM] Dan Watts: yeah psycho people on the fringes who noone listens too
[6/14/17, 5:43:20 PM] Justin: id be shocked if people werent
[6/14/17, 5:43:27 PM] Steve: I have 5 more like that on my feed alone
[6/14/17, 5:43:37 PM] Steve: I'm sure more than you think
[6/14/17, 5:43:42 PM] Dan Watts: funny how shaun king then proceeds to blame trump, as if that was any more plausible
[6/14/17, 5:43:50 PM] Steve: I don't have that many friends
[6/14/17, 5:44:03 PM] Steve: Trumps rhetoric doesn't help
[6/14/17, 5:44:09 PM] Justin: i mean i kinda get it, once again- Trump presidency and the media are like perfect firestorm
[6/14/17, 5:44:14 PM] Steve: Or the fact that he thinks gun control needs to be looser
[6/14/17, 5:44:23 PM] Steve: But the lefts rhetoric isn't any better
[6/14/17, 5:44:27 PM] Justin: guys takign away peoples healthcare, their pensions etc....gonan lead to violence
[6/14/17, 5:45:23 PM] Steve: The left are def pushing that this man will whom our lives
[6/14/17, 5:45:27 PM] Steve: *ruin
[6/14/17, 5:45:34 PM] Steve: Let's not be naive either
[6/14/17, 5:45:59 PM] Steve: And maybe trump will eventually
[6/14/17, 5:46:01 PM] Justin: i mean he really will
[6/14/17, 5:46:03 PM] Steve: But who knows
[6/14/17, 5:46:24 PM] Justin: the right thinks government is coming after them, is delusional
[6/14/17, 5:46:25 PM] Steve: The problem with that is it justifies shootings to mentally unstable people
[6/14/17, 5:46:42 PM] Justin: the left fears trump is cutting progrmas that people depend on, its a reality
[6/14/17, 5:46:41 PM] Steve: Which are not properly treated in this country to begin with
[6/14/17, 5:46:55 PM] Steve: I'm not disagreeing with that
[6/14/17, 5:46:58 PM] Steve: But stick to that
[6/14/17, 5:47:05 PM] Steve: The left doesn't always just say that
[6/14/17, 5:47:34 PM] Justin: well im perosnally not a fan of the whole russia thing, i think its stupid...specifically in the context of how we conduct ourselves on an international scale
[6/14/17, 5:47:37 PM] Steve: They use inflammatory language which leads people, who are unstable, to believe they are left with no choice.
[6/14/17, 5:48:05 PM] Justin: and yeh i think hearing all day that Trump is a russian agent, likely might make osme crazy people on the left do some crazy things
[6/14/17, 5:48:20 PM] Justin: id want to know more dtails
[6/14/17, 5:48:23 PM] Steve: I'm not even talking about the Russia thing
[6/14/17, 5:48:25 PM] Justin: why was this guy still working at 67 yo
[6/14/17, 5:48:27 PM] Steve: But also that
[6/14/17, 5:48:42 PM] Justin: if he had decent union job with a pension, it doesnt make snese
[6/14/17, 5:48:42 PM] Steve: My father is 71 and he's still working
[6/14/17, 5:48:46 PM] Steve: Bill still need to be paid
[6/14/17, 5:48:54 PM] Steve: People owe money even after 65
[6/14/17, 5:48:55 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/14/17, 5:49:09 PM] Justin: true, not neccesarrily a dead give away
[6/14/17, 5:49:11 PM] Steve: Not everyone had a union job
[6/14/17, 5:49:19 PM] Justin: but i thought they were saying he did
[6/14/17, 5:49:29 PM] Justin: havent paid attention most of the day since it happpneed
[6/14/17, 5:49:37 PM] Steve: I have no idea was his employment history is or was
[6/14/17, 5:49:47 PM] Steve: Maybe he did
[6/14/17, 5:49:50 PM] Steve: Don't know
[6/14/17, 5:49:58 PM] Steve: Either way, many people work past 65
[6/14/17, 5:50:29 PM] Justin: 63 is the average, but yeh that is true
[6/14/17, 5:50:38 PM] Steve: My mother is 63
[6/14/17, 5:50:45 PM] Steve: She will not retire in 2 years
[6/14/17, 5:52:45 PM] Justin: 65 and older only makes up 6.2% work force...take that as you will
[6/14/17, 5:52:57 PM] Justin: wait   4.7
[6/14/17, 5:53:32 PM] Steve: Well 2/2 for the 60 year olds that raised me
[6/14/17, 5:53:43 PM] Justin: lol, i mena kinda meaningles
[6/14/17, 5:53:46 PM] Justin: im 2/2 other way
[6/14/17, 5:54:30 PM] Justin: just saying even the fact that people at 67 gotta work, given the political climate and fears around healthcare, even more worriesome things like this may happen more often
[6/14/17, 5:54:47 PM] Justin: althoguh i guess at 67 you are on medicare
[6/14/17, 5:54:51 PM] Justin: so there is that
[6/14/17, 5:54:52 PM] Steve: 60/70
[6/14/17, 5:56:31 PM] Justin: suprised noone mentioned mayweather announcement
[6/14/17, 5:56:42 PM] Steve: It's just a date set
[6/14/17, 5:56:50 PM] Steve: Mayweather still has to agree to it
[6/14/17, 5:56:53 PM] Steve: Which he hasn't
[6/14/17, 6:07:19 PM] Dan Watts: Seeing a bunch of stuff on my gram seems like mayweather agreed and it's set for 8/26
[6/14/17, 6:08:22 PM] Steve: Oh shit, he did agree
[6/14/17, 6:08:29 PM] Steve: They were waiting on him
[6/14/17, 6:10:04 PM] Steve: I'll be in Spain still but should just be mayweather running around and getting a decision
[6/14/17, 6:11:56 PM] Justin: you beat katz to the punch
[6/14/17, 6:12:39 PM] Kiyoon: Damn that's pretty soon
[6/14/17, 6:26:07 PM] Miller: Not getting a dime from me
[6/14/17, 6:27:39 PM] Kiyoon: Odds McGregor forgets it's a boxing fight and round houses Mayweather in the face?
[6/14/17, 6:29:35 PM] Miller: 0
[6/14/17, 6:29:36 PM] Miller: Odds it's fixed?
[6/14/17, 6:29:37 PM] Miller: Last good mixed sport boxing fight was balboa vs thunderlips
[6/14/17, 7:19:29 PM] Miller: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/special-counsel-is-investigating-trump-for-possible-obstruction-of-justice/2017/06/14/9ce02506-5131-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.58492df38c10
[6/14/17, 7:53:48 PM] Steve: To my boy @16318489683 who thinks Ibra is close to Messi, https://youtu.be/jFyr0oVJSXE
#science
[6/14/17, 7:57:50 PM] Miller: Ibra is close to Messi
[6/14/17, 8:17:24 PM] Miller: JUST IN: Bernie Sanders says alleged gunman volunteered on his presidential campaign, adds "I condone this action in the strongest possible terms" http://cnn.it/2t2fGXn
[6/14/17, 8:25:43 PM] Steve: He got an infield hit lol
[6/14/17, 8:41:13 PM] Miller: Wonder if mayweather purposely keeps the fight close to setup a rematch for another 100m
[6/14/17, 8:41:32 PM] Steve: Doubt it
[6/14/17, 8:41:39 PM] Steve: He's gonna copyright 50-0
[6/14/17, 8:42:39 PM] Miller: Pretty sure he's not gonna make 100m off that
[6/14/17, 8:43:03 PM] Steve: Probably not
[6/14/17, 8:43:20 PM] Steve: I think he's done after that
[6/14/17, 8:45:40 PM] Miller: I would agree still tough to turn down 100m for what's essentially a charity boxing match
[6/14/17, 8:50:26 PM] Steve: Mcgegor might start fighting other guys.
[6/14/17, 8:51:07 PM] Miller: Dude if Floyd wants a rematch McGregor isn't turning down 100m because he wants to fight other guys Cmon
[6/14/17, 8:52:00 PM] Justin: lol miller
[6/14/17, 8:52:18 PM] Miller: You caught that?
[6/14/17, 8:52:22 PM] Miller: üòÇ
[6/14/17, 8:52:26 PM] Miller: Was hoping someone would
[6/14/17, 8:52:34 PM] Justin: aziz too fresh
[6/14/17, 8:52:49 PM] Miller: Had just watched that episode tonight was too perfect
[6/14/17, 10:01:42 PM] Miller: Weird how much the Cubs suck this year, I don't even think they've had a ton of injuries but haven't paid super close attention
[6/14/17, 10:25:23 PM] Launchpad: now that Sean King is destroyed can we start counting these types of headlines?

[6/14/17, 10:25:52 PM] Launchpad: things like 'Impeach', 'bring down Trump'
[6/14/17, 10:26:08 PM] Launchpad: how many times was he supposed to be impeached by now?
[6/15/17, 8:26:24 AM] Miller: im sure someone can clear this up for me but given this whole bachelor in paradise debacle i dont really understand the legality of the situation, i get that if a woman is too drunk to consent its considered sexual assault, but what about if both parties are equally drunk? is that like offsetting penalties?
[6/15/17, 8:28:39 AM] Scott: i believe rape is a crime of "general intent"
[6/15/17, 8:28:50 AM] Scott: need only prove negligence or recklessness
[6/15/17, 8:28:59 AM] Scott: following that...intent is not necessary
[6/15/17, 8:29:26 AM] Miller: english?
[6/15/17, 8:29:34 AM] Scott: i'm trying to explain it
[6/15/17, 8:30:03 AM] Scott: i have never handled a rape case, but, this whole consent of consent is based around someone having the capacity and understanding to know what they are doing
[6/15/17, 8:30:40 AM] Scott: and from the flip side, the individual aggressor possibly needing the same
[6/15/17, 8:30:45 AM] Scott: but, rape is a general intent crime
[6/15/17, 8:30:57 AM] Scott: meaning you dont need to rpove that he intended on raping her
[6/15/17, 8:31:10 AM] Scott: you need to prove that his conduct was negligent or reckless under the circumstances
[6/15/17, 8:31:34 AM] Scott: ultimately, if the video footage shows two individuals engaging in sexual intercourse and it seems to be consensual, it will be hard for prosecutors to prove that he raped her
[6/15/17, 8:31:45 AM] Scott: and at the same time, even harder when it comes out that they were both drinking the entire day
[6/15/17, 8:31:58 AM] Scott: have to prove "beyond a reasonable doubt"...seems hard here
[6/15/17, 9:00:35 AM] Miller: if there is a case i would think one against the producers or whoever was filming it and sober and let it go on would be a better target
[6/15/17, 9:00:40 AM] Miller: that case i could see having legs
[6/15/17, 9:01:06 AM] Miller: i just dont understand everyone saying he sexually assaulted her b/c she was too drunk to consent when by all accounts it seems likely he was also too drunk to consent
[6/15/17, 9:09:54 AM] Tk: Does it matter that these allegations  didnt happen on US soil? Thought it was being shot in Mexico?
[6/15/17, 9:13:05 AM] Miller: good question idk
[6/15/17, 9:19:53 AM] Scott: wouldn't be law in the USA
[6/15/17, 9:19:54 AM] Scott: the crime occured in mexico
[6/15/17, 9:28:08 AM] Kiyoon: isn't this the girl that was trying to bang all the time to win her bachelors heart
[6/15/17, 9:29:28 AM] Miller: yes
[6/15/17, 9:29:55 AM] Miller: as we went over w/derrick rose previous actions dont discount someones ability to be sexually assaulted
[6/15/17, 9:30:14 AM] Miller: so its not super relevant, the only relevant thing from her time on bachelor i would note is she def likes to drink
[6/15/17, 9:35:28 AM] Steve: Also the network has to be held responsible for giving them an insane amount of alcohol and not intervening
[6/15/17, 9:37:23 AM] Scott: should it be determined that she was sexually assaulted
[6/15/17, 9:41:50 AM] Miller: seems like almost every reality show would be liable for giving people enough alcohol to make them unable to consent (and filming it)
[6/15/17, 9:41:55 AM] Miller: real world? jersey shore?
[6/15/17, 9:42:26 AM] Steve: We'll see what the details are in full
[6/15/17, 9:43:06 AM] Miller: id be surprised if it goes to trial and isnt settled, cant imagine ABC would want that happening
[6/15/17, 9:43:20 AM] Steve: It might be a criminal trial
[6/15/17, 9:43:27 AM] Steve: ABC has no choice in that
[6/15/17, 9:44:20 AM] Steve: I would think that you filming a sexual assault and not doing anything has to be some sort of criminal offense
[6/15/17, 10:04:45 AM] Scott: Civil not criminal
[6/15/17, 10:07:10 AM] Steve: Taping a sexual assault isn't a crime?
[6/15/17, 10:07:12 AM] Steve: Damn
[6/15/17, 10:07:35 AM] Scott: Maybe on a cyber crime level
[6/15/17, 10:07:42 AM] Scott: But not as u think it is
[6/15/17, 10:07:53 AM] Scott: It's not as if they can be held fully liable for the act of rape
[6/15/17, 10:08:15 AM] Scott: Unless there is what is called pinkerton co conspirator liability and i would doubt this was a conspiracy
[6/15/17, 10:08:20 AM] Launchpad: there was a story recenetly about a girl posting her friend getting raped to facebook live
[6/15/17, 10:08:24 AM] Scott: Or legal conspiracy at that
[6/15/17, 10:08:40 AM] Scott: I'm talking under new york law
[6/15/17, 10:10:27 AM] Steve: So if I film someone being killed and then don't do anything about it, I'm good?
[6/15/17, 10:10:45 AM] Scott: I don't know. I would say it's not criminal but civil
[6/15/17, 10:10:55 AM] Steve: I'm just tying to see the difference
[6/15/17, 10:10:58 AM] Scott: But I don't really know for certain
[6/15/17, 10:11:03 AM] Steve: How that makes sense
[6/15/17, 10:11:07 AM] Steve: Not questioning you
[6/15/17, 10:11:18 AM] Steve: Just curious because I always assumed that was criminal
[6/15/17, 10:14:23 AM] Launchpad: good sumeritan law?
[6/15/17, 10:14:41 AM] Launchpad: it put the seinfeld clan in jail
[6/15/17, 10:14:58 AM] Launchpad: sorry spoiler alert
[6/15/17, 10:15:46 AM] Miller: not sure thats a real thing
[6/15/17, 10:17:05 AM] Steve: Funny thing is I never really watched Seinfeld and I saw that episode lol
[6/15/17, 10:22:30 AM] Donk: yeah i think actual "good samiritain laws" actually pertain more to situations where you cant be held liable for providing assitance to someone in an emergency (like if you give them the heimlich and break on of their ribs administering it)
[6/15/17, 10:25:14 AM] Scott: something is criminal only if there isa v iolation of criminal law
[6/15/17, 10:25:23 AM] Scott: find a criminal law that would be violated
[6/15/17, 10:26:40 AM] Launchpad: thats fucked up
[6/15/17, 10:26:50 AM] Dan Watts: There's actually something called the rescue doctrine meaning if in the act of rescuing someone you hurt them or put them in a worse situation the rescuer can be held liable
[6/15/17, 10:26:55 AM] Launchpad: nm, 'can't'
[6/15/17, 10:28:09 AM] Donk: really, damn. that basically incentives people to not try and help people
[6/15/17, 10:28:44 AM] Donk: just think that if cheese doesnt want to put an airbnb in his name to avoid liablity, imagine if you started choking near him
[6/15/17, 10:28:46 AM] Donk: you dead
[6/15/17, 10:30:42 AM] Steve: Oh yea, also cheese would crush most normal humans with his monster paws
[6/15/17, 10:32:28 AM] Scott: lol
[6/15/17, 10:32:32 AM] Scott: you dead.

[6/15/17, 2:52:26 PM] Dan Watts: never said this
[6/15/17, 2:52:39 PM] Dan Watts: and totally inaccurate
[6/15/17, 2:53:34 PM] Steve: You called him fake news because of his article saying he NFL is racist, among other things
[6/15/17, 2:53:40 PM] Steve: If you don't think that's he same
[6/15/17, 2:53:51 PM] Steve: You are seeing things from another world
[6/15/17, 2:54:10 PM] Dan Watts: i called him fake news because he posted something that was confirmed to be not true
[6/15/17, 2:54:23 PM] Steve: Is it an exaggeration, of course
[6/15/17, 2:54:31 PM] Steve: Not a lie though
[6/15/17, 2:54:41 PM] Steve: You said fake news that NFL is racist for kaep
[6/15/17, 2:54:44 PM] Miller: think we need to continue this in the dinner chat
[6/15/17, 2:54:45 PM] Dan Watts: there's no truth in anythign you said
[6/15/17, 2:54:50 PM] Miller: 2 chats cannot contain this debate
[6/15/17, 2:54:50 PM] Steve: This guy wrote an article saying it was
[6/15/17, 2:54:55 PM] Steve: You called it fake news
[6/15/17, 2:55:04 PM] Dan Watts: once again- said this was a bullshit story which i disagreed with
[6/15/17, 2:55:06 PM] Donk: yeah this is getting really confusing when this is spread over the 2 chats
[6/15/17, 2:55:10 PM] Dan Watts: but never called it fake news
[6/15/17, 2:55:22 PM] Steve: You call him fake news lol
[6/15/17, 2:55:34 PM] Steve: So because you call the guy fake news and not the one article I lied
[6/15/17, 2:55:36 PM] Dan Watts: i called him fake news after the warriors story
[6/15/17, 2:55:37 PM] Dan Watts: which it was
[6/15/17, 2:55:42 PM] Steve: FOH
[6/15/17, 2:55:52 PM] Dan Watts: look at the transcripts i dont care
[6/15/17, 2:56:09 PM] Dan Watts: once again, such a reluctance to be honest about something
[6/15/17, 2:56:15 PM] Dan Watts: if you want to be virtuous own up to your shit
[6/15/17, 2:56:47 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/15/17, 2:56:55 PM] Steve: Go fuck yourself
[6/15/17, 2:57:04 PM] Steve: Telling me in not virtuous?
[6/15/17, 2:57:08 PM] Dan Watts: truth hurts man
[6/15/17, 2:57:09 PM] Steve: Calling me a liar?
[6/15/17, 2:57:16 PM] Dan Watts: i just showed you that you are
[6/15/17, 2:57:33 PM] Steve: Coming from a kid who made up that sean wanted his dick at a party?
[6/15/17, 2:57:38 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/15/17, 2:57:42 PM] Steve: And I'm the liar
[6/15/17, 2:57:47 PM] Steve: When throwing stones
[6/15/17, 2:58:09 PM] Dan Watts: i apologized to him about that
[6/15/17, 2:58:18 PM] Steve: So virtuous of you
[6/15/17, 2:58:30 PM] Dan Watts: at least i have some measure of integrity
[6/15/17, 2:58:56 PM] Steve: And I have no integrity either
[6/15/17, 4:07:17 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/NoCZMtJ-vAo?t=2854 THE WHITES!!!
[6/15/17, 4:07:34 PM] Miller: not some whites

[6/15/17, 4:08:13 PM] Miller: Miller: No Kap deal reflects his inability to play QB at a high level
[6/15/17, 4:08:54 PM] Miller: best believe if/when bennett's play slips he will find himself out of a job too b/c the only reason teams "put up" with him is b/c hes fucking good
[6/15/17, 5:29:28 PM] Brian Katz: Those aren't all synonyms for retarded, seems retarded to me
[6/15/17, 5:56:36 PM] Brian Katz: Mets lost Harvey for a few weeks. Whose staff would you rather have now? Hmmmm
[6/15/17, 5:57:39 PM] Brian Katz: Also Neil walker tried to bunt, and he's done for a bit too lol
[6/15/17, 6:13:33 PM] Miller: I'd still take Degrom matz wheeler and gsellman and Lugo
[6/15/17, 6:24:00 PM] Steve: Lol ^ that's funny
[6/15/17, 6:24:18 PM] Steve: Literally Pineda and severino then the last 4 names you rattled off
[6/15/17, 6:24:21 PM] Steve: It's not even close
[6/15/17, 6:24:30 PM] Steve: *are better
[6/15/17, 6:29:35 PM] Miller: Not close? Is Pineda averaging a triple double also?
[6/15/17, 6:29:40 PM] Miller: I haven't been following closely
[6/15/17, 6:33:40 PM] Miller: The fact you think Pineda and severino are not only better than matz and wheeler but it's not even close just shows your complete lack of objectivity
[6/15/17, 6:34:18 PM] Miller: Would love for you to rationalize that point with an ounce of statistics
[6/15/17, 6:37:11 PM] Justin: in steves defense, statistically speaking in a more difficult league they do have lower era across the baord
[6/15/17, 6:37:22 PM] Justin: i just had to look it up
[6/15/17, 6:37:28 PM] Justin: matz obviousl excluded
[6/15/17, 6:42:21 PM] Miller: So wheeler and Pineda have the same numbers
[6/15/17, 6:42:34 PM] Miller: And matz has a career like 2.5 era
[6/15/17, 6:42:38 PM] Miller: But it's not close
[6/15/17, 6:42:54 PM] Justin: well the its not close part may be wrong
[6/15/17, 6:43:11 PM] Justin: but at the moment league adjusted, they are probably pitchinig better
[6/15/17, 6:43:50 PM] Justin: small sample size though
[6/15/17, 6:44:13 PM] Miller: Unlike severino being good
[6/15/17, 6:44:18 PM] Miller: That's a huge sample size
[6/15/17, 6:44:24 PM] Miller: Ignore his 6 era last year
[6/15/17, 6:44:45 PM] Miller: And Degrom isn't as good as cc or tanaka
[6/15/17, 6:44:47 PM] Miller: Not close
[6/15/17, 6:44:51 PM] Justin: speaking of small sample sizes
[6/15/17, 6:45:58 PM] Miller: He's better than Aaron judge
[6/15/17, 6:45:58 PM] Justin: inability to walk, steal bases, hit for average, or hit for power at a level abseball
[6/15/17, 6:46:00 PM] Miller: Not close
[6/15/17, 6:46:30 PM] Justin: maybe in a year or two hell develop, but a promotion has no statisical evidence supporting it
[6/15/17, 11:29:05 PM] Miller: Anyone use via? If so give me your promo code
[6/15/17, 11:30:42 PM] Scott: Scott4x6
[6/15/17, 11:33:28 PM] Miller: Nobody?

[6/16/17, 9:03:11 AM] Miller: holy shit amazon buying whole foods
[6/16/17, 9:05:17 AM] Steve: Does that mean I get same day delivery of food?
[6/16/17, 9:05:31 AM] Miller: technically amazon already does that
[6/16/17, 9:05:34 AM] Miller: amazon fresh
[6/16/17, 9:05:43 AM] Steve: But it's not Whole Foods
[6/16/17, 9:05:48 AM] Miller: right yea idk
[6/16/17, 9:05:55 AM] Miller: idk what this means, very confusing, im sure they have some plan to integrate it idk
[6/16/17, 9:06:16 AM] Steve: This is an exciting time
[6/16/17, 9:46:26 AM] Launchpad: kind of a good move for whole foods -- they've lost their market edge
[6/16/17, 9:46:50 AM] Launchpad: whole foods....more like whole paycheck!
[6/16/17, 9:49:12 AM] Launchpad: happy birthday Steve
[6/16/17, 9:50:17 AM] Steve: Thanks LP
[6/16/17, 9:51:11 AM] Donk: trader joes>whole foods
[6/16/17, 9:52:22 AM] Donk: also, not going to lie, i love the trader joes schtick about renaming themselves on ethnic foods - like trader jose's on the mexican food, trader guiseppe's on the italian, etc

[6/16/17, 9:54:14 AM] Miller: serious question besides the whole ripping off the name part is it illegal to buy things from a store and re-sell them?
[6/16/17, 9:54:52 AM] Miller: gonna need to get a lawyer on retainer for this chat
[6/16/17, 9:55:44 AM] Miller: cheese is too busy getting started on his jury selection in july and watts too busy digging through shaun kings old tweets
[6/16/17, 9:56:55 AM] Launchpad: sometimes on like the package of cheezits, it says 'Not for individual resale'
[6/16/17, 9:57:12 AM] Miller: thats if you buy like a big case of mini boxes or something though
[6/16/17, 9:57:16 AM] Launchpad: so hard to tell if he's reselling individual items, but if he is, they should stomp his throat in
[6/16/17, 9:57:22 AM] Miller: like you could buy a case and re-sell the whole case right?
[6/16/17, 9:57:43 AM] Miller: i assumed he was literally just buying things and re-selling them not like re-packaging them in any way
[6/16/17, 10:01:37 AM] Launchpad: theres a pizza place in Yorktown where the owner writes a '1' in sharpie on the .99c cans

[6/16/17, 10:04:54 AM] Launchpad: this guy also gives you a hard time for asking for extra napkins
[6/16/17, 10:05:16 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvBlZy0wFOE atlanta needs to come back, this was the funniest shit ever
[6/16/17, 10:21:26 AM] Justin: Presumably violates Canadian FDA?
[6/16/17, 10:23:12 AM] Miller: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/14/shaun-king-shares-banning-white-men-theory-after-s/
[6/16/17, 10:23:29 AM] Justin: Lol
[6/16/17, 10:24:10 AM] Launchpad: Repost
[6/16/17, 10:24:23 AM] Justin: Thoughts about the false equivalence argument and found a good analogy
[6/16/17, 10:25:00 AM] Miller: do you have "false equivalence" and "strawman" buttons on your keyboard?
[6/16/17, 10:25:29 AM] Justin: If the left was as crazy as the right.   There would be websites and internet shows devoted to proving that the scalper shooting was a conspiracy to drive up attendance at the congressional baseball game
[6/16/17, 10:26:04 AM] Miller: the left not being as crazy as the right doesnt mean the extreme left isnt crazy either
[6/16/17, 10:26:13 AM] Miller: that is def photoshopped steve
[6/16/17, 10:26:17 AM] Miller: bernie does not know how to use a computer
[6/16/17, 10:26:21 AM] Miller: he files his taxes by hand
[6/16/17, 10:26:25 AM] Justin: He looks confused
[6/16/17, 10:26:40 AM] Justin: But That's the point of false equivalence miller
[6/16/17, 10:26:49 AM] Steve: That's actually a future look at herman
[6/16/17, 10:26:57 AM] Justin: The fact that they both exist does t mean you treat them the same
[6/16/17, 10:27:20 AM] Justin: Like the nets and Yankees both exist. Only one is ny's baseball team
[6/16/17, 10:27:20 AM] Miller: but you also cant just say false equivalence and then dismiss it
[6/16/17, 10:27:36 AM] Miller: and one is formerly NJ now brooklyns basketball team?
[6/16/17, 10:27:47 AM] Justin: Fucken typos
[6/16/17, 10:27:54 AM] Steve: Don't make Miller post all this articles telling us how the mets are the new team of NY
[6/16/17, 10:28:03 AM] Miller: quinnipiac poll
[6/16/17, 10:28:05 AM] Justin: Conspiracy theory
[6/16/17, 10:28:06 AM] Miller: #realnews
[6/16/17, 10:28:15 AM] Miller: although im sure that is like 80/20 the other way now
[6/16/17, 10:28:23 AM] Miller: given its like 50% bandwagon fans
[6/16/17, 10:28:45 AM] Justin: Yeh Seahawks of the MLB
[6/16/17, 10:29:19 AM] Miller: like herman is it a false equivolance to say benny C and shaq are both tall?
[6/16/17, 10:29:29 AM] Miller: clearly, one is regular tall and one is a giant
[6/16/17, 10:29:37 AM] Miller: that however doesnt mean benny C isnt tall
[6/16/17, 10:29:46 AM] Miller: its a false false equivocalness
[6/16/17, 10:29:52 AM] Justin: Well that's a matter of relativity
[6/16/17, 10:29:59 AM] Miller: as is everything
[6/16/17, 10:30:06 AM] Miller: or did you not read einsteins theory on int?
[6/16/17, 10:30:22 AM] Justin: Yeh but to say the left is as violent or as crazy
[6/16/17, 10:30:41 AM] Justin: To say it exists, sure.
[6/16/17, 10:31:08 AM] Justin: But in a country of 400 million almost everything will exist in a large enough group
[6/16/17, 10:31:20 AM] Miller: saying something completely subjective and quantifiable like that is equivalent is impossible to prove or disprove anyway
[6/16/17, 10:31:25 AM] Steve: I gotta agree with Miller
[6/16/17, 10:31:39 AM] Justin: Look at terrorist attacks
[6/16/17, 10:31:44 AM] Justin: Look st militia numbers
[6/16/17, 10:31:50 AM] Miller: damn 31 is a good age for you steve
[6/16/17, 10:31:59 AM] Miller: reached the old and wise stage
[6/16/17, 10:32:11 AM] Justin: The terrorism on the left involves freeing animals from cages
[6/16/17, 10:32:14 AM] Steve: I believe they are just as crazy on the far left as they are on the far right
[6/16/17, 10:32:26 AM] Justin: And throwing paint on fur
[6/16/17, 10:32:30 AM] Steve: It may be a generally less violent kind of crazy
[6/16/17, 10:32:36 AM] Steve: But it's def just as crazy
[6/16/17, 10:32:40 AM] Miller: i mean some dude literally just opened fire on innocent people so kind of tough to disprove
[6/16/17, 10:32:55 AM] Steve: He did
[6/16/17, 10:32:58 AM] Justin: That's insane
[6/16/17, 10:32:58 AM] Steve: And that's awful
[6/16/17, 10:33:21 AM] Steve: But the bigger issue is dealing with people with mental disorders
[6/16/17, 10:33:30 AM] Steve: That and gun control is he bigger issue
[6/16/17, 10:33:41 AM] Steve: Just calling them crazy and they should be locked up is not the solution
[6/16/17, 10:34:00 AM] Brian Katz: I have a fur coat now from my grandfather. Warmest thing I've ever worn. I'd suggest miller getting one, never be cold again
[6/16/17, 10:34:21 AM] Justin: Watch out for crazies on the left katz
[6/16/17, 10:34:25 AM] Miller: tbh im not sure i could pull it off
[6/16/17, 10:34:32 AM] Miller: ill stick w/my fleece and 2 space heaters
[6/16/17, 10:35:41 AM] Justin: King point is fair. Why is the Miami shooter considered in mass a Muslim shooting
[6/16/17, 10:35:48 AM] Steve: Literally a senator yesterday was quoted as saying "That we're not going to let the bad guys or the crazies interrupt our lives."
[6/16/17, 10:36:01 AM] Justin: But this guy is omfonsidered a leftist because Facebook posts instead of a crazy white guy
[6/16/17, 10:36:01 AM] Steve: How about you offer those crazies a form of therapy hat they can afford
[6/16/17, 10:36:15 AM] Steve: Or facilities to house them for the disorders
[6/16/17, 10:36:26 AM] Miller: i mean herman the guy had a bernie sanders profile picture
[6/16/17, 10:36:29 AM] Miller: come on
[6/16/17, 10:36:34 AM] Steve: Or how about you make it harder for "crazies" to buy a gun and a silencer
[6/16/17, 10:36:40 AM] Miller: if someone had the same shit w/trump would you not classify them as a conservative or alt right?
[6/16/17, 10:37:06 AM] Justin: Idk, I mean it depends on the target
[6/16/17, 10:37:10 AM] Justin: Here sure
[6/16/17, 10:37:18 AM] Justin: But let's say he shot up some grocery store
[6/16/17, 10:37:33 AM] Justin: Think they would change the narrative?
[6/16/17, 10:38:30 AM] Justin: I'm in agreement here.
[6/16/17, 10:38:31 AM] Dan Watts: Is @16316620763 defending Shaun King?  Or am I making this up in my head
[6/16/17, 10:39:15 AM] Justin: Katz you need to go google the word defend in a dictionary
[6/16/17, 10:39:22 AM] Justin: Sorry watts*
[6/16/17, 10:39:23 AM] Miller: lol
[6/16/17, 10:39:37 AM] Miller: herman distinguishes between defending shaun kings message/ideas and defending shaun king himself
[6/16/17, 10:41:34 AM] Justin: Somewhat accurate miller. Highlighting a sentence from an article isn't defending anything.
[6/16/17, 10:43:11 AM] Justin: Lol
[6/16/17, 10:43:17 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YaaZZN9VYs
[6/16/17, 10:52:12 AM] Launchpad: Maybe their wouldn't be so many shootings if the liberal left wasn't pushing their violent gun message
[6/16/17, 10:52:14 AM] Launchpad: http://www.washingtontimes.com/multimedia/collection/bang-your-buck-best-handguns-under-500/
[6/16/17, 10:53:53 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/16/17, 10:53:54 AM] Launchpad: lol nope üòÇ
[6/16/17, 10:53:57 AM] Steve: Get em
[6/16/17, 10:55:35 AM] Launchpad: "I am against banning any group of people, but factually speaking, banning white men would drastically reduce mass shootings"
[6/16/17, 10:55:35 AM] Launchpad: from what, everything?
[6/16/17, 10:55:40 AM] Launchpad: would be real good for commerce too
[6/16/17, 10:56:45 AM] Launchpad: "I am against banning any group of people, but factually speaking, banning muslims would drastically reduce terrorist attacks" - Donald Trump
[6/16/17, 10:58:14 AM] Justin: Yeh he's not pointing out the irony in the ban Muslims argument st all there. He's being dead serious
[6/16/17, 10:58:17 AM] James  L: Happy Birthday Steve
[6/16/17, 10:58:58 AM] Steve: Thanks jimbo
[6/16/17, 10:59:04 AM] Justin: Watts article the other day about Shaun king screwing over his organization , sure.
[6/16/17, 11:00:03 AM] Justin: This article where he's pointing out the stupidity of scapegoating Muslims in the name of American security when in fact white people are 99% domestic terrorism, not so much
[6/16/17, 11:03:01 AM] Dan Watts: This number can't be true when you factor in Orlando and San bernidino
[6/16/17, 11:04:03 AM] Justin: So that's 2
[6/16/17, 11:04:09 AM] Justin: 9-11 3
[6/16/17, 11:04:18 AM] Justin: Care to add up all the mass shootings?
[6/16/17, 11:04:24 AM] Justin: School shootings
[6/16/17, 11:04:50 AM] Dan Watts: I'm just saying 2016
[6/16/17, 11:05:00 AM] Dan Watts: 99% is nowhere near the number
[6/16/17, 11:05:19 AM] Justin: There been 146 school shootings since sandy hook in 2013
[6/16/17, 11:05:45 AM] Justin: Well SAN be riding was 2015
[6/16/17, 11:06:05 AM] Justin: So now I just need to find 98 mass shootings in 2016 for your heart picked statistic
[6/16/17, 11:06:25 AM] Justin: I could just say in 2002-2014 the rate was zero according g to watts math
[6/16/17, 11:06:44 AM] Justin: But hey I suppose picking decades as time ranges is cherry picking as well
[6/16/17, 11:06:58 AM] Donk: Dont forget about boston
[6/16/17, 11:07:31 AM] Donk: But i agree that its very likely 95%+
[6/16/17, 11:07:39 AM] Justin: True
[6/16/17, 11:07:49 AM] Justin: And damn my typos suck when rage texting
[6/16/17, 11:08:21 AM] Justin: Yeh I mean on same day as congresional shooting there was another shooting
[6/16/17, 11:09:06 AM] Kiyoon: Happy bday Mr Stephen "Despacito" Merenes
[6/16/17, 11:10:36 AM] Steve: Also don't forget a few weeks ago when a crazed white guy killed two people when they defended the minorities he was attacking
[6/16/17, 11:10:58 AM] Justin: You gave me a decent project watts. I'll get you some graphs for 2016.
[6/16/17, 11:11:40 AM] Kiyoon: And wait a minute, you guys made Steve stay with me all night on his birthday???
[6/16/17, 11:11:57 AM] Dan Watts: The guy in San Francisco was Asian btw
[6/16/17, 11:12:18 AM] Steve: And then was arraigned in court https://youtu.be/Y-ZA15k-3Es
[6/16/17, 11:12:50 AM] Steve: Thanks @16313981203
[6/16/17, 11:34:25 AM] Justin: Wapo actually did a pretty interesting breakdown, https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/mass-shootings-in-america/
[6/16/17, 11:36:13 AM] Justin: Interesting point against gun statistics over half gun deaths are suicides. I'm gonna assume no one ever tells that story in gun death stats
[6/16/17, 11:39:48 AM] Donk: OG Donkey Lips!
[6/16/17, 11:48:45 AM] Scott: brilliant!
[6/16/17, 11:49:53 AM] Justin: you missed first 25 small girls he hit on and crashed and burned before he perfected his craft
[6/16/17, 11:50:08 AM] Justin: the S.C.O.T.T
[6/16/17, 11:50:54 AM] Launchpad: yeah but that mean it got 25 matches
[6/16/17, 11:51:00 AM] Launchpad: ** I
[6/16/17, 11:52:13 AM] Justin: theres some irony there, if you were 6-1, that be matches you got in about an hour
[6/16/17, 11:52:49 AM] Justin: #bitchesareheighsist
[6/16/17, 11:52:58 AM] Launchpad: my problem isn't getting matches, its putting in the time & work to send creative messages to turn into dates
[6/16/17, 11:53:03 AM] Miller: is that a real conversation?
[6/16/17, 11:53:15 AM] Justin: looks real
[6/16/17, 11:53:15 AM] Launchpad: lol yeah
[6/16/17, 11:53:29 AM] Justin: invite him out
[6/16/17, 11:53:39 AM] Scott: invite raj
[6/16/17, 11:53:41 AM] Justin: hahahahahha
[6/16/17, 11:53:47 AM] Miller: ill add him to the chat
[6/16/17, 11:53:56 AM] Launchpad: lol
[6/16/17, 11:53:56 AM] Scott: to "dindin"
[6/16/17, 11:53:56 AM] Scott: ?
[6/16/17, 11:53:59 AM] Launchpad: thats good
[6/16/17, 11:54:03 AM] Justin: LP wasn't trying to hate, i appreicate the originality
[6/16/17, 11:54:11 AM] Launchpad: dont know about calling the girl a bitch
[6/16/17, 11:54:18 AM] Justin: not sure if that came across, was just messing with you on perfecting it part
[6/16/17, 11:54:40 AM] Miller: i saw that other one on IG yest
[6/16/17, 11:54:53 AM] Miller: so wasnt sure if a bunch of like 4'11 memes were floating around for some reason
[6/16/17, 11:54:58 AM] Launchpad: I stole the 'perfect little spoon' size line but the rest was all me üòè
[6/16/17, 11:55:21 AM] Justin: oh well
[6/16/17, 11:55:29 AM] Launchpad: cause you can use that almost any time a girl lists her height
[6/16/17, 11:55:56 AM] Launchpad: Its too exhausting being 100% creative and original all the time.  It ends up with messages not being sent
[6/16/17, 11:55:57 AM] Justin: yeh appreciation fading
[6/16/17, 11:56:24 AM] Launchpad: lol shut up
[6/16/17, 11:56:27 AM] Justin: idk guess it depends on profile and pictures
[6/16/17, 11:56:35 AM] Justin: if there isnt alot there i agree
[6/16/17, 11:57:04 AM] Justin: otherwise i mean a picture can tell a thousand words and all
[6/16/17, 11:57:58 AM] Launchpad: yeah but it don't always tell a thousand jokes
[6/16/17, 11:58:36 AM] Justin: i guess different strokes different folks, sean thinks "hey" works still
[6/16/17, 11:59:10 AM] Launchpad: texting guys and girls.....not even on the same planet
[6/16/17, 11:59:27 AM] Launchpad: 'wanna come over and blow me' also works on guys
[6/16/17, 12:02:19 PM] Miller: you get a lot of guys to come over with that one?
[6/16/17, 12:21:11 PM] Launchpad: i guess I kind of walked into that one..
[6/16/17, 12:21:25 PM] Launchpad: point is - 'hey' does not work for guys texting girls
[6/16/17, 12:21:58 PM] Launchpad: 'hey' - may as well be 'I'm boring and lazy and have nothing to say so I'm putting it on you to lead the conversation'
[6/16/17, 12:23:11 PM] Miller: yea i think everyone would agree need to put a lot more in to try to get a girls attention via texting, just couldnt resist that alley oop you threw me
[6/16/17, 12:24:11 PM] Sean: It does!
[6/16/17, 12:24:39 PM] Launchpad: hey
[6/16/17, 12:24:42 PM] Launchpad: whats up?
[6/16/17, 12:24:43 PM] Launchpad: how are you?
[6/16/17, 12:24:49 PM] Launchpad: what are you up to?
[6/16/17, 12:24:51 PM] Launchpad: doing anything fun?
[6/16/17, 12:24:58 PM] Sean: When you have a face like mine all I need to say is hey
[6/16/17, 12:25:07 PM] Launchpad: boring stuff
[6/16/17, 12:26:09 PM] Steve: Gay men are also just in it mainly to get dick
[6/16/17, 12:26:12 PM] Steve: Let's be honest
[6/16/17, 12:26:31 PM] Sean: When you right you right
[6/16/17, 12:26:47 PM] Steve: With women it's almost always the complete opposite
[6/16/17, 12:27:08 PM] Launchpad: they are there to actively resist the dick
[6/16/17, 12:27:14 PM] Sean: I love the generalizing of gay men üëèüëè
[6/16/17, 12:27:31 PM] Miller: üè≥‚Äçüåà
[6/16/17, 12:27:42 PM] Launchpad: its what we do
[6/16/17, 12:27:43 PM] Steve: It's not generalizing it's what you've shown me
[6/16/17, 12:27:49 PM] Launchpad: to be fair we generalize everyone
[6/16/17, 12:27:54 PM] Sean: I'm one homo amongst millions
[6/16/17, 12:27:56 PM] Steve: Literally every guy you talk to on the "dating app"
[6/16/17, 12:28:08 PM] Steve: You have never once showed me a guy looking for a relationship
[6/16/17, 12:28:12 PM] Sean: I know but just busting his chop bc he doesn't generalize often
[6/16/17, 12:28:18 PM] Sean: Ummm michael?
[6/16/17, 12:28:18 PM] Steve: Maybe you just need to show me more
[6/16/17, 12:28:26 PM] Steve: Variety
[6/16/17, 12:28:27 PM] Sean: We never even discussed sex
[6/16/17, 12:28:34 PM] Steve: How's that working for you now?
[6/16/17, 12:28:35 PM] Sean: Never sent a dick pic
[6/16/17, 12:28:42 PM] Sean: Good I'm in a relationship
[6/16/17, 12:28:52 PM] Steve: In a good open relationship
[6/16/17, 12:28:58 PM] Steve: That's my point
[6/16/17, 12:29:05 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/16/17, 12:29:16 PM] Launchpad: livin the dream
[6/16/17, 12:29:22 PM] Steve: It's amazing
[6/16/17, 12:29:24 PM] Steve: And he's amazing
[6/16/17, 12:29:34 PM] Steve: But I have never found a woman to be open to that
[6/16/17, 12:29:40 PM] Steve: It's a different world in that sense
[6/16/17, 12:29:42 PM] Miller: wait that open relationship comment from yest wasnt a joke?
[6/16/17, 12:31:40 PM] Justin: i didnt realize that either
[6/16/17, 12:31:51 PM] Justin: sean bombs being dropped
[6/16/17, 12:32:10 PM] Miller: at least follow standard breaking news photo protocol
[6/16/17, 12:32:13 PM] Miller: kids these days
[6/16/17, 12:32:19 PM] Steve: Lol that was my fault and I thought he told you guys
[6/16/17, 12:32:22 PM] Steve: My bad sean
[6/16/17, 12:32:33 PM] Steve: Really thought it was a known thug at this point
[6/16/17, 12:33:02 PM] Justin: so does this mean sean could in theory suck watts dick?
[6/16/17, 12:33:06 PM] Justin: too soon?
[6/16/17, 12:33:26 PM] Steve: Too soon
[6/16/17, 12:33:28 PM] Steve: Too far
[6/16/17, 12:33:31 PM] Steve: Too everything
[6/16/17, 12:33:34 PM] Justin: too everything
[6/16/17, 12:34:13 PM] Justin: blame it on the starbucks coffee, way to much caffeine
[6/16/17, 12:34:21 PM] Steve: Urgh gross
[6/16/17, 12:35:59 PM] Sean: Who made the comment yesterday?
[6/16/17, 12:36:01 PM] Dan Watts: Still waiting for those graphs
[6/16/17, 12:36:28 PM] Sean: So I guess that's that y'all know my business now
[6/16/17, 12:36:38 PM] Steve: Damn, I'm sorry
[6/16/17, 12:36:39 PM] Justin: i had long drawn out message but i dropped it.. its on  my phone
[6/16/17, 12:36:44 PM] Steve: I really though everyone knew
[6/16/17, 12:37:11 PM] Justin: If we go by safety of the nation and mass shootings involving 4 or more dead, number probably closer to 99%. There's 100's multiple death incidents a year. If we narrow the range like several outlets in that article we have little data for only 2016.
[6/16/17, 12:37:29 PM] Miller: why not 3 or more dead?
[6/16/17, 12:37:56 PM] Justin: well if you got to the end of the wapoo article
[6/16/17, 12:38:00 PM] Justin: thats what they used
[6/16/17, 12:38:20 PM] Justin: if you look at multiple homiceide incidents than its gonna be about .1%
[6/16/17, 12:38:25 PM] Sean: When and who said that?
[6/16/17, 12:39:57 PM] Dan Watts: Show me graphs
[6/16/17, 12:40:03 PM] Dan Watts: I want graphs
[6/16/17, 12:40:16 PM] Justin: the article covnerts the data into "graphs"
[6/16/17, 12:40:30 PM] Dan Watts: It says 99% whites?
[6/16/17, 12:40:38 PM] Justin: no
[6/16/17, 12:40:47 PM] Justin: im operating undder an assumption
[6/16/17, 12:40:47 PM] Dan Watts: No further questions
[6/16/17, 12:40:54 PM] Dan Watts: No further questions
[6/16/17, 12:41:05 PM] Justin: that assumption is that any multiple murder by a muslim make snational media coverage
[6/16/17, 12:41:10 PM] Justin: bold assumption i suppose
[6/16/17, 12:41:17 PM] Dan Watts: No further questions
[6/16/17, 12:41:20 PM] Justin: but in reality it isnt
[6/16/17, 12:45:38 PM] Justin: @miller  The definition of mass shooting used for the Stanford database is 3 or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter. The shooting must not be identifiably gang, drug, or organized crime related.
[6/16/17, 12:46:22 PM] Launchpad: Id be curious about the demographics for shootings of 1 or more victim....
[6/16/17, 12:48:55 PM] Justin: are you implying some racial element in that question? reliogus like i said 1 or more would be almost non existant
[6/16/17, 12:49:14 PM] Justin: less than .1% if every multiple murder not even 1 murder homicide was looked at
[6/16/17, 12:49:30 PM] Justin: guns vs knifes
[6/16/17, 12:50:49 PM] Steve: I think I know how to make things better with @15165329107. Hey guys, I had some shit on my dick a little while ago and thought it was herpes but we all in the clear. Just a really fucking scary happening. Only sean knew. Now you all know.
[6/16/17, 12:52:17 PM] Sean: Are you dumb? You think by telling people you had a herpes scare justifies you telling people shit about my relationship that I confided in you?
[6/16/17, 12:52:33 PM] Steve: I thought it would be close
[6/16/17, 12:52:42 PM] Steve: Eye for an eye
[6/16/17, 12:52:58 PM] Steve: Since I also confided with you
[6/16/17, 12:53:03 PM] Steve: Na?
[6/16/17, 12:53:06 PM] Steve: Well I tried
[6/16/17, 12:53:10 PM] Steve: Not much I can do now
[6/16/17, 12:53:11 PM] Sean: Yeah and I kept my fucking mouth shut
[6/16/17, 12:53:28 PM] Steve: I thought the majority knew
[6/16/17, 12:53:45 PM] Justin: so in 2016 31 mass murder incidents of 4 or more not gnag related---- so 1 of them was muslim
[6/16/17, 12:53:51 PM] Justin: so thats 97%
[6/16/17, 12:53:59 PM] Justin: wow i was off by alot, even cherry picking 2016
[6/16/17, 12:54:22 PM] Justin: super disenengous to say 99% off top of my head instead of 97%
[6/16/17, 12:54:27 PM] Dan Watts: Show me where you go that from
[6/16/17, 12:54:44 PM] Justin: http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/mass-killings/index.html#explore
[6/16/17, 12:55:37 PM] Justin: fitler for 2016
[6/16/17, 12:55:42 PM] Justin: 31 incidents
[6/16/17, 12:55:46 PM] Miller: damn not having herpes is truly the best birthday gift you can get
[6/16/17, 12:55:56 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/16/17, 12:56:00 PM] Dan Watts: theres no indication of race on this thing
[6/16/17, 12:56:32 PM] Steve: Oh absolutely
[6/16/17, 12:56:57 PM] Dan Watts: no further questions
[6/16/17, 12:57:00 PM] Justin: tehres 31 cases w descriptions
[6/16/17, 12:57:20 PM] Justin: like i said tis not a bold statement to assume any mulsim incident makes antional media
[6/16/17, 12:57:29 PM] Dan Watts: so i'm supposed to assume-4 people killed in chicago was done by a white person?
[6/16/17, 12:57:42 PM] Justin: and beyond that are you saying if person is mulism-its religosu
[6/16/17, 12:57:52 PM] Justin: well thats fair
[6/16/17, 12:58:09 PM] Justin: i should edit my statement to 99% arent done by muslims
[6/16/17, 12:58:12 PM] Justin: you are right
[6/16/17, 12:58:22 PM] Justin: i am wrong if i balme it all on white people
[6/16/17, 12:58:21 PM] Dan Watts: yeah i would agree with that
[6/16/17, 12:58:26 PM] Justin: they have race breakdowns earlier on
[6/16/17, 12:58:35 PM] Justin: white is still the majority
[6/16/17, 12:58:43 PM] Justin: think like 50% in most the studies since 1980's
[6/16/17, 12:59:04 PM] Justin: but those studies find less incidents overall where as this one finds more....
[6/16/17, 12:59:35 PM] Justin: it all dpends on the definiton of mass shooting etc.....could argue excluding gang related will exclude minorities and is in itself unfair
[6/16/17, 12:59:57 PM] Justin: so id will disproportionately sway statistics to making white murders the majority
[6/16/17, 1:01:53 PM] Justin: 3
Asian	6
Black	15
Latino	7
Native American	3
Other	5
unclear	1
White	49
White	1
[6/16/17, 1:02:05 PM] Justin: was mother jones summary
[6/16/17, 1:06:43 PM] Launchpad: binghamton shooter was asian
[6/16/17, 1:09:46 PM] Dan Watts: 50% way less than the 99% you stated earlier.  Also whites rep 60%+ population, so i don't know how statistically significant this is.  Seems like whites perform mass shootings at or near their population population percentage.  Not a statistics guy but i'm open to other conclusions AND don't see how one can equate jihadist terrorist attacks to mass shootings
[6/16/17, 1:11:50 PM] Dan Watts: also should be stated that while mass shootings have happened elsewhere, they have not happened at the frequency that they do in the US and seems to be a uniquely american phenomenon
[6/16/17, 1:12:34 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/NoCZMtJ-vAo?t=2854 THE WHITES!!!
[6/16/17, 1:12:40 PM] Steve: Lack of Gun control, lack of help for people with mental disorders
[6/16/17, 1:16:14 PM] Launchpad: Lack of knife skills
[6/16/17, 1:16:38 PM] Launchpad: if Americans were more skilled in hand to hand combat some of those mass shootings would have been mass stabbings like they do in China
[6/16/17, 1:36:51 PM] Justin: what you say is true and logical, but the point King is making is that the argument that we need to ban Muslims, or how we represent Muslims as a danger to our American safety, is illogical.  Proportionately they  make up for less crime, than their overall population, and their population is tiny.  But in terms of "general safety" or threat to "national security" percentages of a specific sub population aren't important, raw overall numbers are.  In the extreme it would make a population "safer" to ban all (sub in any large group of people), than banning say 10 actual terrorists.  Obviously such hyperbole is idiotic but i think that's the entire point.
[6/16/17, 2:16:54 PM] Dan Watts: looks like cosby is getting off
[6/16/17, 2:19:17 PM] Launchpad: he still giving out those pills?

[6/16/17, 3:31:17 PM] Miller: thats actually like the least amount he has ever had
[6/16/17, 3:32:03 PM] Miller: listen here you  beautiful bitch im about to fuck you up with some truth

[6/16/17, 3:55:29 PM] Justin: here comes dont use that word
[6/16/17, 3:55:40 PM] Launchpad: ummm no... its basically saying you look so good you can't be real
[6/16/17, 3:55:49 PM] Dan Watts: legit question- if someone DMs you on IG and you read it, can they tell you read it
[6/16/17, 3:56:00 PM] Miller: i believe so
[6/16/17, 3:57:06 PM] Miller: so yes
[6/16/17, 3:57:12 PM] Justin: "Thanks for the A2A Rahul .

When you send someone a direct message on Instagram and when the respective person sees it , there appears a eye below your message with the username of the person you sent it to ."
[6/16/17, 3:57:15 PM] Miller: a little eyeball icon pops up when it is read
[6/16/17, 3:57:18 PM] Launchpad: she said one last thing about how I could never get a girl look her (community college dropout?)
[6/16/17, 3:57:47 PM] Justin: need more pics
[6/16/17, 3:57:51 PM] Miller: tell her you gon be hot a little while imma be rich forever
[6/16/17, 3:57:51 PM] Miller: deuces
[6/16/17, 3:57:51 PM] Launchpad: **like her
[6/16/17, 3:57:58 PM] Launchpad: she already unmatched me
[6/16/17, 3:58:04 PM] Justin: are they all as stupid as her profile pic?
[6/16/17, 3:58:05 PM] Miller: damn
[6/16/17, 3:58:08 PM] Miller: wasting all my good material
[6/16/17, 3:58:18 PM] Launchpad: she was fucken hot
[6/16/17, 3:58:23 PM] Launchpad: but a goddamn idiot
[6/16/17, 3:59:23 PM] Steve: So just because you think you were calling her to hot to be real she took that as an insult
[6/16/17, 3:59:34 PM] Dan Watts: this chick i went on a couple dates in 2013, slid into my DMs with "hey, how are u? it's been YEARS"
[6/16/17, 3:59:37 PM] Steve: Now I know, she's dumb and stupid and that's on her
[6/16/17, 3:59:46 PM] Miller: 4 actually
[6/16/17, 3:59:49 PM] Steve: In your mind
[6/16/17, 3:59:49 PM] Justin: yeh shes just stupid
[6/16/17, 4:00:14 PM] Justin: althogh thats what you ge tmaybe for using a generic pickup line?
[6/16/17, 4:00:14 PM] Launchpad: thats the first non-positive response I've gotten with that line
[6/16/17, 4:00:23 PM] Steve: Still doesn't make it less of you not believing it's her because she can't be that hot
[6/16/17, 4:00:24 PM] Launchpad: I put her name in it
[6/16/17, 4:00:28 PM] Dan Watts: not going to open it so it seems like i read it and am trying to think of something clever to write back
[6/16/17, 4:00:30 PM] Justin: like damn scotty originality come on
[6/16/17, 4:00:34 PM] Justin: lol
[6/16/17, 4:00:35 PM] Miller: yea i thought your opener was fine, i didnt think it was that complicated in terms of understanding the implication
[6/16/17, 4:00:35 PM] Launchpad: Its called a fucken joke!!!
[6/16/17, 4:00:37 PM] Dan Watts: when in fact thats exactly what im doing
[6/16/17, 4:00:46 PM] Justin: more compliment than a joke
[6/16/17, 4:00:52 PM] Launchpad: Steve does
[6/16/17, 4:00:59 PM] Miller: but im sure she gets a lot of stupid fucking messages so she was defensive and probably mis interpeted it or misread it
[6/16/17, 4:01:08 PM] Justin: defintiely not complicated- makes me wonder if she was a bot
[6/16/17, 4:01:08 PM] Miller: happens around these parts quite a bit
[6/16/17, 4:01:12 PM] Miller: shit gets lost in translation
[6/16/17, 4:01:22 PM] Launchpad: not a bot
[6/16/17, 4:01:22 PM] Steve: Textlation
[6/16/17, 4:01:24 PM] Miller: HOW DARE YOU YOU FUCKING MORON GO GROW SOME HAIRLINE
[6/16/17, 4:02:12 PM] Launchpad: that was probably the most antagonistic interaction I've had on Tinder
[6/16/17, 4:02:20 PM] Steve: Also, that can be misinterpreted in person too but easier to talk through
[6/16/17, 4:02:28 PM] Steve: If she didn't get it initially
[6/16/17, 4:02:35 PM] Miller: "you tryna get the pipe?" always works
[6/16/17, 4:02:42 PM] Launchpad: lol

[6/16/17, 4:11:11 PM] Miller: (philandro castle)
[6/16/17, 4:11:18 PM] Justin: lol
[6/16/17, 4:11:23 PM] Steve: Didn't know if everyone knew his name

[6/18/17, 1:24:34 PM] Justin: Why you calling your Super a moron?
[6/18/17, 1:24:54 PM] Miller: I thought he was calling himself a moron for losing his keys
[6/18/17, 1:25:56 PM] Steve: Cheese gave uber about $100 yesterday to try and find his keys
[6/18/17, 1:26:21 PM] Scott: 30 but thx
[6/18/17, 1:32:09 PM] Scott: It was a shitty experience.
[6/18/17, 1:32:36 PM] Steve: Seemed like it
[6/18/17, 5:06:41 PM] Scott: Lol
[6/18/17, 5:06:44 PM] Scott: U love this app

[6/19/17, 12:50:30 PM] Launchpad: Is DJ Kaled even a real DJ?
[6/19/17, 12:53:19 PM] Brian Katz: I thought he sold cellphones
[6/19/17, 12:54:49 PM] Miller: depends what you mean by real dj
[6/19/17, 12:58:22 PM] Brian Katz: He's about as much of a dj as dj tanner
[6/19/17, 1:01:48 PM] Steve: Well he full name is Donna jo
[6/19/17, 1:02:03 PM] Launchpad: Good point
[6/19/17, 1:02:04 PM] Steve: Don't know if that qualifies her to be a disc jockey or not
[6/19/17, 1:05:05 PM] Miller: on the plus side she could just use her real name
[6/19/17, 1:15:43 PM] Justin: definteily Islamophobia

[6/19/17, 5:09:31 PM] Dan Watts: rooting for McGregor now LMAO
[6/19/17, 5:13:34 PM] Miller: Lol honestly can't imagine anyone isn't already rooting for McGregor
[6/19/17, 5:14:06 PM] Kiyoon: in relation to that article, fuck Shaun King
[6/19/17, 5:14:29 PM] Miller: Guys a loudmouth but mayweather is a horrible person
[6/19/17, 5:14:36 PM] Donk: yeah pretty sure there are like 4 mayweather fans
[6/19/17, 5:14:53 PM] Donk: greg hardy, ray rice and maybe like 2 others
[6/19/17, 5:15:43 PM] Miller: Bieber
[6/19/17, 6:49:12 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/19/17, 6:50:06 PM] Launchpad: That dude actually tweeted tpain asking for a yearbook quote
[6/19/17, 6:54:15 PM] Scott: U would have done it...stop playing yourself.
[6/19/17, 6:55:36 PM] Miller: I'm not even sure if launchpad is asking a question or making a statement or just describing things he sees
[6/19/17, 6:55:39 PM] Miller: I love lamp
[6/19/17, 6:56:23 PM] Launchpad: Lmao didn't notice the first pic
[6/19/17, 6:57:23 PM] Miller: This weather is crazy, Steve you plan a BBQ today or something?
[6/19/17, 6:57:38 PM] Steve: Covfefe
[6/19/17, 6:57:44 PM] Steve: And no BBQ today
[6/19/17, 6:57:58 PM] Steve: I'm actually exhausted
[6/19/17, 6:58:08 PM] Steve: This weekend crushed me
[6/19/17, 7:35:56 PM] Steve: David griffin out as cave GM
[6/19/17, 7:36:00 PM] Steve: Makes no sense
[6/19/17, 7:36:11 PM] Steve: *Cavs
[6/19/17, 7:36:31 PM] Miller: I read earlier they wanted him but he didn't necessarily want to come back
[6/19/17, 7:36:37 PM] Miller: Wanted a raise
[6/19/17, 7:36:43 PM] Steve: I read that too
[6/19/17, 7:37:14 PM] Steve: But still didn't expect that guy to leave that team now
[6/19/17, 7:37:42 PM] Miller: Wonder if the real GM will leave also
[6/19/17, 7:37:55 PM] Steve: He won't yet
[6/19/17, 7:38:00 PM] Steve: He wants to beat he warriors
[6/19/17, 7:38:11 PM] Steve: And this team gives him the best shot
[6/19/17, 7:38:41 PM] Steve: Especially if they can pull the trigger on a Paul George/jimmy butler trade
[6/19/17, 7:38:43 PM] Miller: Unless he joins the warriors
[6/19/17, 7:38:51 PM] Steve: They don't have the cap space
[6/19/17, 7:38:57 PM] Miller: Wasn't serious
[6/19/17, 7:39:10 PM] Miller: Would love to see it just for katz to be mad
[6/19/17, 7:39:32 PM] Steve: They have to have Durant take 4million less just to resign iguadola
[6/19/17, 7:39:45 PM] Miller: Yea idk he needs to obviously stay in the east so probably no better options than staying in Cleveland
[6/19/17, 7:39:57 PM] Miller: I guess he could join Boston or Philly
[6/19/17, 7:39:57 PM] Steve: Unless he joins the celtics
[6/19/17, 7:40:02 PM] Steve: And hey get butler
[6/19/17, 7:40:11 PM] Steve: Thomas, butler, james and co.?
[6/19/17, 7:41:01 PM] Miller: I think he's too old to deal with waiting for these kids but I'd love to see him on Philly
[6/19/17, 7:41:16 PM] Steve: Yea they still are a year or two away
[6/19/17, 7:41:23 PM] Steve: But he's only 32
[6/19/17, 7:41:31 PM] Steve: Considering he's played like 14 seasons
[6/19/17, 7:42:07 PM] Steve: And they need their guys to stay healthy
[6/19/17, 7:42:08 PM] Miller: Probably stays in Cleveland and they trade love for George or something
[6/19/17, 7:42:26 PM] Steve: Yea
[6/19/17, 7:42:37 PM] Steve: They'll probably trade love this offseason
[6/19/17, 7:42:54 PM] Miller: Knicks should give them Melo also
[6/19/17, 7:42:59 PM] Steve: Or maybe Carmelo goes there
[6/19/17, 7:43:02 PM] Miller: Would be a great fit
[6/19/17, 7:43:03 PM] Steve: God I hope
[6/19/17, 7:43:15 PM] Steve: Should have tried to do it last year
[6/19/17, 7:44:15 PM] Miller: Bron kyrie pg and Melo can compete with gsw
[6/19/17, 7:44:28 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[6/19/17, 7:44:34 PM] Steve: Just don't think the knocks want love
[6/19/17, 7:44:42 PM] Steve: *knicks
[6/19/17, 7:44:53 PM] Miller: Love would be traded for pg
[6/19/17, 7:45:00 PM] Miller: Cavs trade picks for Melo
[6/19/17, 7:45:33 PM] Miller: God knows if they can make all that math work under the cap
[6/19/17, 7:45:40 PM] Miller: Might need to move Thompson or something
[6/19/17, 7:46:26 PM] Steve: They have to trade a salary with melo
[6/19/17, 7:46:37 PM] Steve: Or for melo I mean
[6/19/17, 7:46:46 PM] Steve: It can't just be picks
[6/19/17, 7:47:26 PM] Miller: Yea idk you need to be a rocket scientist to understand the nba salary cap but in general teams always find ways to make it work
[6/19/17, 7:47:50 PM] Steve: Yea but I'm thinking love for melo is the easiest
[6/19/17, 7:47:57 PM] Steve: Because their contracts are close
[6/19/17, 8:13:41 PM] Kiyoon: 3 way trade it
[6/19/17, 8:37:18 PM] Launchpad: Huge! https://www.facebook.com/barstoolsports/videos/10155506780282502/
[6/19/17, 9:16:57 PM] Kiyoon: not a squirrel like john murray?
[6/19/17, 10:18:03 PM] Brian Katz: I mean why not? This way we can just start watching in June.
[6/19/17, 10:19:14 PM] Launchpad: This never would have happened in the NBA with Bernie Sanders at the helm
[6/19/17, 10:24:54 PM] Kiyoon: Kyrie/butler/george/LeBron vs curry/thompson/green/durant
[6/19/17, 10:25:11 PM] Kiyoon: Feel like I'd take team 1
[6/19/17, 10:25:23 PM] Miller: I dont think they can get both butler and George
[6/19/17, 10:25:44 PM] Kiyoon: Hypothetically if they couls
[6/20/17, 11:14:52 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/20/17, 11:15:33 AM] Steve: I would be shocked
[6/20/17, 11:15:49 AM] Steve: It just doesn't make sense
[6/20/17, 11:15:50 AM] Steve: Under control 2 more years
[6/20/17, 11:15:52 AM] Steve: He's only 21
[6/20/17, 11:15:53 AM] Donk: i just dont understand what the point would be
[6/20/17, 11:16:13 AM] Donk: unless it is an overwhelming offer
[6/20/17, 11:16:18 AM] Steve: Exactly
[6/20/17, 11:16:23 AM] Donk: like bostons 3rd pick, next years brooklyn pick and maybe another one
[6/20/17, 11:16:24 AM] Steve: Which in sure it won't be
[6/20/17, 11:16:29 AM] Launchpad: only thing I can think of is the plot of Major League
[6/20/17, 11:16:46 AM] Donk: ha, exactly
[6/20/17, 11:17:00 AM] Donk: now getting rid of basically anyone else on the knicks roster? that probably makes sense starting with carmelo
[6/20/17, 11:17:07 AM] Steve: Absolutely
[6/20/17, 11:17:12 AM] Steve: Should have 2 years ago
[6/20/17, 11:17:26 AM] Steve: When i was hated on in this or other group chats for wanting it
[6/20/17, 11:17:27 AM] Donk: they should have never resigned him
[6/20/17, 11:17:36 AM] Steve: They had no choice
[6/20/17, 11:17:46 AM] Donk: they could have not signed him
[6/20/17, 11:17:47 AM] Steve: I feel like it was the David wright mets type deal
[6/20/17, 11:17:56 AM] Steve: They didn't have a choice donk
[6/20/17, 11:18:05 AM] Steve: They just thought they could get other players
[6/20/17, 11:18:10 AM] Donk: but they should have never made the original deal for melo and waited for him in free agency
[6/20/17, 11:18:11 AM] Steve: To go with him
[6/20/17, 11:18:20 AM] Steve: That yes
[6/20/17, 11:18:26 AM] Steve: But the resigning had to be done
[6/20/17, 11:18:32 AM] Steve: They had and still have no one else
[6/20/17, 11:18:37 AM] Donk: i dont know if it did
[6/20/17, 11:18:39 AM] Steve: Other than Kristaps
[6/20/17, 11:18:51 AM] Donk: at that point signing him was basically locking them into not winning a championship while melo still played
[6/20/17, 11:18:53 AM] Steve: Look at the team and free agents that war
[6/20/17, 11:18:55 AM] Brian Katz: Maybe they're closing up shop
[6/20/17, 11:18:59 AM] Donk: if instead they had not signed him and tanked, it would have been better
[6/20/17, 11:19:05 AM] Steve: And they hoped they would sign another guy
[6/20/17, 11:19:14 AM] Steve: Clearly in hindsight it was not a great move
[6/20/17, 11:19:30 AM] Steve: But they thought they could lure at least one other big name free agent
[6/20/17, 11:19:35 AM] Steve: And they failed
[6/20/17, 11:19:46 AM] Steve: They wouldn't have had he picks anyway
[6/20/17, 11:19:55 AM] Miller: they clearly built that whole thing to make a run at lebron
[6/20/17, 11:19:57 AM] Steve: They've only had 3 first round picks since 2010
[6/20/17, 11:19:57 AM] Miller: it didnt work
[6/20/17, 11:20:02 AM] Steve: Yea
[6/20/17, 11:20:09 AM] Miller: if they had gotten lebron im sure nobody would have complained
[6/20/17, 11:20:13 AM] Miller: about anything that happened
[6/20/17, 11:20:19 AM] Steve: Them and the heat have had the lowest first round picks since 2010
[6/20/17, 11:20:21 AM] Miller: even if you have a 5% chance at that you have to take it
[6/20/17, 11:20:57 AM] Steve: I agree
[6/20/17, 11:21:00 AM] Steve: And they did
[6/20/17, 11:21:02 AM] Steve: And it failed
[6/20/17, 11:21:17 AM] Brian Katz: The Knicks are trash, and will always be trash. They won't play another meaningful game in my lifetime
[6/20/17, 11:21:51 AM] Steve: You sure your not a mets fan katz with all that pessimism?
[6/20/17, 11:22:08 AM] Miller: seriously
[6/20/17, 11:22:47 AM] Brian Katz: Not at all. I don't sometimes believe that my team might win. I'm out in the knicks after the Oakley thing. This just blew my mind.
[6/20/17, 11:23:07 AM] Miller: lol of all things
[6/20/17, 11:24:43 AM] Brian Katz: If you were going to suck all the time that's one thing, but to throw out one of my favorite players from when the team was actually good? I'm out
[6/20/17, 11:25:17 AM] Brian Katz: I tossed all my knicks gear
[6/20/17, 11:26:05 AM] Miller: even the john starks jersey?
[6/20/17, 11:26:10 AM] Miller: that was basically your summer uniform
[6/20/17, 11:26:52 AM] Brian Katz: I may have kept that, but you won't see me in that again lol

[6/20/17, 1:18:22 PM] Justin: Lol. So I gave cliff notes
[6/20/17, 1:18:24 PM] Steve: But it was good
[6/20/17, 1:19:53 PM] Justin: Also @15166335046 was right...Alyssa Milano is broke, there can't be that big a women's sports gear market.
[6/20/17, 1:22:43 PM] Kiyoon: that was my murray reference yesterday @16316620763
[6/20/17, 1:22:53 PM] Justin: By default makes lavarr ball right as wel though
[6/20/17, 1:25:47 PM] Justin: Watch out. Got one lawyer in here that wouldn't hesitate to sue you Kiyoon
[6/20/17, 1:26:32 PM] Steve: Cheese is too busy holding press conferences and selecting jury's
[6/20/17, 1:49:04 PM] Miller: The New York Daily News is reporting that Celtics are one of the teams interested in trading for Kristaps Porzingis.
[6/20/17, 1:50:39 PM] Miller: Uber to allow tipping for drivers, reversing long-standing policy

[6/20/17, 1:52:52 PM] Launchpad: everyone gets a tip these days
[6/20/17, 1:53:09 PM] Launchpad: pay everyone $15 an hour and make tipping illegal
[6/20/17, 1:53:15 PM] Dan Watts: Not lawyers
[6/20/17, 1:57:52 PM] Steve: Because $15 an hour is a livable wage in NY
[6/20/17, 1:58:48 PM] Launchpad: with a couple of roommates or to buy a house?
[6/20/17, 1:59:35 PM] Steve: Buy a condo
[6/20/17, 1:59:45 PM] Steve: Rent an apartment on your own
[6/20/17, 1:59:55 PM] Steve: Somewhere in the middle
[6/20/17, 2:00:18 PM] Launchpad: if you can't get anything more than a minimum wage job, why would you deserve 'to live on your own'
[6/20/17, 2:00:29 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/20/17, 2:00:36 PM] Launchpad: whats wrong with having a roommate?
[6/20/17, 2:00:40 PM] Launchpad: to share expenses?
[6/20/17, 2:00:45 PM] Steve: Many people don't have the option to 'deserve it'
[6/20/17, 2:00:59 PM] Steve: They have no choice
[6/20/17, 2:01:10 PM] Steve: Nothing wrong with it
[6/20/17, 2:01:11 PM] Launchpad: White privilege: I NEED MY OWN HOUSE! I CAN'T SHARE
[6/20/17, 2:01:15 PM] Steve: It's not an option many times
[6/20/17, 2:01:22 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/20/17, 2:01:45 PM] Steve: White privilege: not understanding how anyone could not be you
[6/20/17, 2:01:53 PM] Steve: Or do everything you do
[6/20/17, 2:01:56 PM] Steve: As a white male
[6/20/17, 2:02:09 PM] Steve: Who has a job that pays him more than $15 N hour
[6/20/17, 2:02:40 PM] Steve: My point is simple, $15 an hour is $10 after taxes
[6/20/17, 2:02:51 PM] Steve: If you work 40 hours you make $400
[6/20/17, 2:02:59 PM] Steve: At most $1600
[6/20/17, 2:03:08 PM] Steve: Wishing 40 hours
[6/20/17, 2:03:13 PM] Steve: Take away health insurance
[6/20/17, 2:03:18 PM] Steve: That's 200-300
[6/20/17, 2:03:21 PM] Launchpad: i guess that is pretty shitty for a place like NY
[6/20/17, 2:03:33 PM] Steve: Take away electric, another $40-$100
[6/20/17, 2:03:42 PM] Steve: Cell phone- $50-100
[6/20/17, 2:03:54 PM] Steve: Cable- $70-80
[6/20/17, 2:04:07 PM] Steve: Rent- 1000-1500
[6/20/17, 2:04:12 PM] Steve: What are you left with now?
[6/20/17, 2:04:26 PM] Launchpad: cmon, Netflix $10
[6/20/17, 2:04:31 PM] Steve: So let's say you get a roommate
[6/20/17, 2:04:46 PM] Steve: Instead of 1000-1500 it's 700-1000
[6/20/17, 2:04:58 PM] Steve: So you are left with what, $200 for the month?
[6/20/17, 2:05:06 PM] Steve: And I still haven't factored in groceriesz
[6/20/17, 2:05:15 PM] Steve: Let's say another 100-200 a month
[6/20/17, 2:05:33 PM] Steve: Meaning you work 40 hours a week to net $0
[6/20/17, 2:05:35 PM] Donk: Dont forget weed, thats a necessity
[6/20/17, 2:05:36 PM] Launchpad: lets just go UBI already
[6/20/17, 2:06:04 PM] Steve: $15 an hour in this state or it's neighboring states is impossible
[6/20/17, 2:06:18 PM] Steve: Jersey, CT...
[6/20/17, 2:07:12 PM] Steve: Even with a roommate
[6/20/17, 2:07:51 PM] Launchpad: whats NY minimum wage?
[6/20/17, 2:08:33 PM] Miller: 1. launchpads rent is $400 2. nobody needs a cell phone 3. groceries are overrated, have you heard of freeganism?
[6/20/17, 2:08:53 PM] Steve: It's 10.50 I believe
[6/20/17, 2:08:56 PM] Steve: Which is a joke
[6/20/17, 2:09:08 PM] Steve: I'd agree that you don't need an iPhone
[6/20/17, 2:09:10 PM] Launchpad: dont forget breatharianism
[6/20/17, 2:09:14 PM] Steve: But a cell phone is necessary
[6/20/17, 2:09:20 PM] Steve: How does an employer even contact you?
[6/20/17, 2:09:22 PM] Launchpad: def not cable but internet yes
[6/20/17, 2:09:30 PM] Launchpad: and some sort of phone
[6/20/17, 2:09:31 PM] Steve: Internet you need
[6/20/17, 2:10:20 PM] Steve: Let's say you love on a flip phone and no internet, you probably come away every month with $200 to do anything else you need/want.
[6/20/17, 2:10:29 PM] Steve: And that's if you don't have debt
[6/20/17, 2:54:59 PM] Miller: http://www.eonline.com/news/861488/bachelor-in-paradise-cleared-of-misconduct-allegations
The  statement continued to reveal that production on the fourth season will resume, with new policies in place to ensure the "safety and security" of everyone involved in filming. "Production on this season of Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show's policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants."
[6/20/17, 2:55:00 PM] Miller: yasssssssssssssssssss
[6/20/17, 3:10:33 PM] Justin: does that mean they will or willnt show that chick getting raped next season?
[6/20/17, 3:11:36 PM] Miller: probably will cut all footage of her/him is my guess
[6/20/17, 3:11:52 PM] Miller: please correct your statement to put raped in quotes, ty
[6/20/17, 3:13:31 PM] Steve: That's a joke
[6/20/17, 3:13:40 PM] Steve: But what's new with society
[6/20/17, 3:15:32 PM] Miller: i mean all we know for sure is they were drunk and had sex
[6/20/17, 3:15:41 PM] Miller: not like cosby pt 2
[6/20/17, 3:16:17 PM] Steve: We also know that she has to be carried to bed
[6/20/17, 3:16:27 PM] Steve: Afterwards
[6/20/17, 3:16:41 PM] Steve: Which doesn't sound like a woman who was conscious
[6/20/17, 3:17:07 PM] Kiyoon: maybe she passed out after
[6/20/17, 3:17:25 PM] Steve: Lol ok
[6/20/17, 3:18:01 PM] Steve: How many times has a girl passed out right after you had sex with her and then had to be carried to bed?
[6/20/17, 3:18:33 PM] Donk: launchpad will tell you that you arent fucking her right if she doesnt pass out afterwards
[6/20/17, 3:18:43 PM] Miller: just saying none of us have seen the video and i would assume if there was a video of a guy having sex with her unconcious the show would not be resuming filming
[6/20/17, 3:18:52 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/20/17, 3:18:54 PM] Steve: Right Miller
[6/20/17, 3:18:55 PM] Miller: there was also talk that she was the aggressor and sat on his face
[6/20/17, 3:18:58 PM] Miller: so maybe shes the rapist
[6/20/17, 3:19:04 PM] Steve: Because they are are morally responsible
[6/20/17, 3:19:09 PM] Miller: or is it not rape if you dont have to be carried to bed?
[6/20/17, 3:19:11 PM] Steve: Which is why he show shutdown to begin with
[6/20/17, 3:19:22 PM] Steve: Yup
[6/20/17, 3:19:24 PM] Steve: That's good
[6/20/17, 3:19:26 PM] Steve: Go with that
[6/20/17, 3:19:29 PM] Steve: Miller logic
[6/20/17, 3:19:38 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/20/17, 3:19:52 PM] Steve: "I love the show and am clearly excited so will rationalize this to make myself feel ok about it"
[6/20/17, 3:19:54 PM] Kiyoon: Yeah I dno, if they watched all the footage and it showed she was engaged into it
[6/20/17, 3:20:13 PM] Kiyoon: and that it was consensual, don't really care if she was carried to bed after or not
[6/20/17, 3:20:13 PM] Steve: They watched he footage before too
[6/20/17, 3:20:16 PM] Steve: They filmed it
[6/20/17, 3:20:17 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/20/17, 3:20:34 PM] Steve: No your right, the crew doesn't really watch it the first time around
[6/20/17, 3:20:42 PM] Steve: They just press record and chill out
[6/20/17, 3:20:52 PM] Steve: I'm not saying she was raped or not raped
[6/20/17, 3:21:25 PM] Miller: youre pretty clearly implying she was raped
[6/20/17, 3:21:26 PM] Steve: I'm just saying a show resuming doesn't prove or disprove anything
[6/20/17, 3:21:38 PM] Steve: And you shouldn't be excited about a show like that
[6/20/17, 3:21:47 PM] Miller: you can stick to your technicalities i never exactly said "corrine olympios was raped" all you want
[6/20/17, 3:21:49 PM] Steve: Because if it was your daughter I'm sure our have a different take
[6/20/17, 3:22:26 PM] Steve: *you'd
[6/20/17, 3:22:30 PM] Kiyoon: They probably wouldn't be filming if there was the slightest bit of indication that it wasn't consensual
[6/20/17, 3:22:45 PM] Miller: *insert sarcastic steve comment*
[6/20/17, 3:23:00 PM] Steve: I don't think that's necessarily true
[6/20/17, 3:23:00 PM] Kiyoon: and false, my daughter would never be allowed on the bachelor
[6/20/17, 3:23:16 PM] Steve: I think they think she didn't get raped and will probably settle with the woman
[6/20/17, 3:23:30 PM] Steve: Sorry if I automatically side with women who think they were sexually assaulted
[6/20/17, 3:23:51 PM] Kiyoon: I think you should see the footage yourself to judge
[6/20/17, 3:24:06 PM] Kiyoon: which we probably never will see the footage
[6/20/17, 3:24:08 PM] Steve: She still thinks she was
[6/20/17, 3:24:11 PM] Steve: I believe her
[6/20/17, 3:24:21 PM] Kiyoon: because she says so?
[6/20/17, 3:24:27 PM] Steve: Yes
[6/20/17, 3:24:47 PM] Kiyoon: You believe Amanda Knox didn't kill that women?
[6/20/17, 3:24:49 PM] Steve: I don't think most normal women lie about that
[6/20/17, 3:25:02 PM] Kiyoon: How do you know shes normal?
[6/20/17, 3:25:02 PM] Steve: In fact, it is proven that most women keep that they were a secret
[6/20/17, 3:25:15 PM] Steve: So because you have an extreme case it's all lie always?
[6/20/17, 3:25:25 PM] Donk: i think its 2-8% of report rapes are lies
[6/20/17, 3:25:26 PM] Steve: So you know how many cases are out there in total?
[6/20/17, 3:25:33 PM] Miller: i dont think most "normal" women go on the bachelor so theres that
[6/20/17, 3:25:40 PM] Kiyoon: I'm just tryin to point out that you believe someone
[6/20/17, 3:25:42 PM] Kiyoon: that you dont know
[6/20/17, 3:25:44 PM] Kiyoon: because they said so
[6/20/17, 3:25:44 PM] Steve: And how many women are even to scared, distraught or in denial to come forward?
[6/20/17, 3:25:47 PM] Donk: but that percentage is only out of reported rapes, most dont get reported
[6/20/17, 3:25:48 PM] Steve: Give me a break
[6/20/17, 3:26:30 PM] Steve: I believe women who say they were raped because it's though enough for them to even come forward
[6/20/17, 3:26:44 PM] Steve: If it is proven through evidence that they lied then so be it
[6/20/17, 3:26:46 PM] Miller: so back to my original point a week ago, what if the footage shows she was very drunk (too drunk to consent) and had sex with a guy (while not passed out and engaged), was she raped?
[6/20/17, 3:26:51 PM] Steve: They lied and should be prosecuted for that
[6/20/17, 3:27:06 PM] Steve: But I am not you guys discrediting women because "I don't know them"
[6/20/17, 3:27:14 PM] Steve: Or "look at Amanda Knox"
[6/20/17, 3:27:16 PM] Steve: Sorry
[6/20/17, 3:27:20 PM] Steve: That's just me
[6/20/17, 3:27:21 PM] Kiyoon: I'm not discrediting anything
[6/20/17, 3:27:24 PM] Kiyoon: I have no idea if he was raped or not
[6/20/17, 3:27:27 PM] Kiyoon: I haven't seen the footage
[6/20/17, 3:27:42 PM] Kiyoon: I'm not impying WB is covering up a rape
[6/20/17, 3:27:43 PM] Steve: If she was too drunk to sin sent then she was raped
[6/20/17, 3:27:45 PM] Steve: Yes
[6/20/17, 3:27:50 PM] Steve: *consent
[6/20/17, 3:27:53 PM] Miller: so what if he was also too drunk to consent?
[6/20/17, 3:28:03 PM] Miller: and how many women have you had sex with that were too drunk to consent?
[6/20/17, 3:28:11 PM] Steve: None
[6/20/17, 3:28:14 PM] Miller: LOL
[6/20/17, 3:28:15 PM] Miller: stop
[6/20/17, 3:28:15 PM] Kiyoon: I agree with you Steve, but that's an I
[6/20/17, 3:28:15 PM] Steve: All of them were conscious
[6/20/17, 3:28:16 PM] Kiyoon: IF*
[6/20/17, 3:28:23 PM] Steve: Some of them were underage
[6/20/17, 3:28:28 PM] Steve: But none were unconscious
[6/20/17, 3:28:31 PM] Miller: you can EASILY be too drunk to consent and concious
[6/20/17, 3:28:33 PM] Steve: Or too drunk to say yes or no
[6/20/17, 3:28:35 PM] Miller: those are not at all the same thing
[6/20/17, 3:28:45 PM] Miller: too drunk to consent also doesnt mean too drunk to speak
[6/20/17, 3:28:57 PM] Steve: Every woman I've had sex with has said they wanted to have sex
[6/20/17, 3:29:01 PM] Miller: again
[6/20/17, 3:29:02 PM] Steve: In their words
[6/20/17, 3:29:03 PM] Miller: thats not the point
[6/20/17, 3:29:07 PM] Kiyoon: where's the tape
[6/20/17, 3:29:10 PM] Steve: Yes it is
[6/20/17, 3:29:14 PM] Miller: that is not that too drunk to consent means
[6/20/17, 3:29:17 PM] Steve: If they say they want to have sex
[6/20/17, 3:29:20 PM] Steve: And then you have sex
[6/20/17, 3:29:30 PM] Steve: And then they say they didn't consent then they were not raped
[6/20/17, 3:29:31 PM] Kiyoon: yeah that won't hold up in court
[6/20/17, 3:29:33 PM] Miller: say w/e you want to you cannot re-write the law
[6/20/17, 3:29:57 PM] Miller: too drunk to consent doesnt mean they said they wanted to have sex, completely different things
[6/20/17, 3:30:06 PM] Steve: Show me a case where a woman said she wanted to have sex and it was proven she was "too drunk to consent"
[6/20/17, 3:30:08 PM] Steve: I'll wait
[6/20/17, 3:30:32 PM] Kiyoon: Didn't the Stanford kid state that she wanted to have sex?
[6/20/17, 3:30:35 PM] Steve: Meaning she was awake and said either "yes let's have sex or something to that extent"
[6/20/17, 3:30:37 PM] Steve: Nope
[6/20/17, 3:30:40 PM] Kiyoon: she said she wanted*
[6/20/17, 3:30:42 PM] Steve: She was passed out
[6/20/17, 3:30:48 PM] Steve: Literally unconscious
[6/20/17, 3:31:00 PM] Miller: According to Godsoe, ‚ÄúMany colleges have found impairment for rape even where the [survivor] actively consented both verbally and via body language.‚Äù
[6/20/17, 3:31:19 PM] Miller: you have no idea, that is media speculation
[6/20/17, 3:31:25 PM] Steve: Nope
[6/20/17, 3:31:31 PM] Steve: It was in the court documents
[6/20/17, 3:31:36 PM] Steve: We covered it with people
[6/20/17, 3:31:46 PM] Steve: As wel as the two witnesses that stopped him
[6/20/17, 3:31:53 PM] Miller: im talking about BIP
[6/20/17, 3:31:57 PM] Steve: And detained him until the police came
[6/20/17, 3:32:13 PM] Miller: idk anything about stanford
[6/20/17, 3:32:35 PM] Miller: thought you were once again saying corrine was passed out
[6/20/17, 3:32:38 PM] Miller: i apologize for misreading
[6/20/17, 3:32:45 PM] Steve: Who's Corrine?
[6/20/17, 3:33:18 PM] Steve: Oh Corrine on your couch hat New Years?
[6/20/17, 3:33:28 PM] Steve: She was def not passed out
[6/20/17, 3:33:46 PM] Steve: Which is why your wife yelled at her to get up and not hook up with me
[6/20/17, 3:34:06 PM] Miller: corrine is the woman in question on bachelor in paradise
[6/20/17, 3:34:18 PM] Steve: Didn't know her name
[6/20/17, 3:36:46 PM] Steve: I don't know if Corrine from BIP was passed out or not because it was never confirmed.
[6/20/17, 3:37:08 PM] Steve: But I do know by the time they finished she was passed out and had to be carried to bed.
[6/20/17, 3:37:23 PM] Steve: Which is not a good sign
[6/20/17, 4:45:23 PM] Miller: Corinne Olympios was so drunk when she got sexual with fellow "Bachelor in Paradise" castmate, DeMario Jackson, she did a face-plant in the Jacuzzi and after she was dragged and laying on the ground the sexual contact continued, but sources who have seen the video say it just didn't happen.
Sources involved in Corinne's representation tell TMZ ... she had a half a bottle of champagne in a vehicle before arriving at the bar, where she had some mixed drinks with hard liquor as well as one or 2 shots.
The sources say she did not object to the sexual contact and may have indeed consented, but they say she was not capable of consent, point to the "Jacuzzi face-plant" and being laid out on the ground.
They also claim a cast member told producers after the face-plant to stop, but they responded that she was "fine."  
But our sources who have seen the video say Corinne's version is "absolutely not true" ... no face-plant, no being laid out on the ground ... nothing like that. The sources who have seen the tape say she was clearly with it the entire time in the pool, and there's no ambiguity after seeing the video.
The sources add none of the cast members complained ... quite the opposite they say ... many have come forward to say Corinne knew exactly what she was doing.

[6/20/17, 6:15:13 PM] Steve: You think they get George now?
[6/20/17, 6:15:20 PM] Steve: Heard that's heating up also
[6/20/17, 6:15:46 PM] Miller: Swaggy p stays winning
[6/20/17, 6:15:46 PM] Miller: Sure seems like giving up on russel
[6/20/17, 6:16:11 PM] Miller: They should not trade for George
[6/20/17, 6:16:56 PM] Donk: Great deal for the nets imo
[6/20/17, 6:17:16 PM] Miller: Supposedly wants to go there anyway and they don't have the assets to waste
[6/20/17, 6:17:47 PM] Miller: Rule of thumb anyone getting mozgod automatically wins
[6/20/17, 6:18:12 PM] Steve: Yea I never liked Lopez that much
[6/20/17, 6:18:14 PM] Miller: (except maybe when Cleveland traded like 2 1sts for him lol)
[6/20/17, 6:18:22 PM] Steve: In terms of building a franchise around him
[6/20/17, 6:18:31 PM] Miller: He's always hurt
[6/20/17, 6:18:31 PM] Steve: Russell should be better and the cornerstone
[6/20/17, 6:18:35 PM] Miller: And he's soft
[6/20/17, 6:18:43 PM] Miller: And he's not that nice when he's healthy
[6/20/17, 6:19:01 PM] Steve: He is a 15 & 8 guy when healthy
[6/20/17, 6:19:11 PM] Miller: I generally hate any 7 footer who averages 6 rebounds a game, it's fucking embarrassing
[6/20/17, 6:19:15 PM] Steve: But that's not a cornerstone talent for a team rebuilding
[6/20/17, 6:23:04 PM] Dan Watts: Nets chat about to get popping off again

[6/20/17, 6:33:50 PM] Miller: Guessing they felt they had to give up russel to clear mozgod contract, I think this gives them double max room next year
[6/20/17, 6:36:11 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[6/20/17, 6:37:17 PM] Miller: @WojVerticalNBA: For the Lakers, this is longer-term play to clear space for Paul George and LeBron James pursuit. Lonzo Ball on way at 2
[6/20/17, 6:38:01 PM] Steve: Figured the George thing
[6/20/17, 6:38:10 PM] Steve: Don't know if lebron goes to them that soon
[6/20/17, 6:38:20 PM] Steve: Figured he would do mid thirties swing to LA
[6/20/17, 8:34:02 PM] Steve: A lot of things I'm reading are giving the lakers the edge in the deal
[6/20/17, 8:34:12 PM] Steve: Maybe it's just me and my dislike for Lopez
[6/20/17, 8:34:42 PM] Steve: I'm with @19732079889 on the nets winning that trade
[6/20/17, 9:32:11 PM] Tk: D Howard traded again. Crazy how I dude w that size, strength n built cant fit into any team.
[6/20/17, 9:32:52 PM] Steve: Because he's a head case and gets injured a lot
[6/20/17, 9:32:57 PM] Steve: Can hit a free throw
[6/20/17, 9:35:44 PM] Miller: Got so confused and thought he was joining Anthony Davis and cousins and couldn't wait to see how that was going to work
[6/20/17, 9:36:03 PM] Steve: That's New Orleans
[6/20/17, 9:37:00 PM] Miller: Who can keep up when what team is called the hornets anymore
[6/20/17, 9:37:23 PM] Steve: Also true
[6/20/17, 9:37:30 PM] Steve: Not a fan of the pelicans name

[6/20/17, 9:59:00 PM] Justin: Was pulling into spot and started texting
[6/20/17, 9:59:45 PM] Justin: Wasn't even watching this race. Was. Ruined disgusted by ossofs "moderates win" strategy
[6/20/17, 10:00:04 PM] Justin: Beyond disgusted by ossofs*
[6/20/17, 10:00:05 PM] Miller: Can't wait to see Stephans rational nuanced take on this
[6/20/17, 10:00:18 PM] Brian Katz: Are you somehow out of breath texting?
[6/20/17, 10:00:28 PM] Justin: Ossofs was a centrist shitty candidate. There is that
[6/20/17, 10:00:54 PM] Miller: This is what you fucking deserve for not following the path of the Bernie the democrats will never win anything and I'm leaving the party and I'm done
[6/20/17, 10:01:16 PM] Justin: I mean you sure as fuck won't win districts like that.
[6/20/17, 10:04:56 PM] Justin: @realdonaldtrump 50 million couldn't buy one point---sad
[6/20/17, 10:12:48 PM] Dan Watts: Forgot about the Georgia election bc all I see in my news feed is this cheese press conference
[6/21/17, 12:31:40 AM] Justin: Yeh saw that earlier
[6/21/17, 10:41:46 AM] Miller: if anyone is having issues w/spotify web player lmk i figured out a workaround
[6/21/17, 10:54:58 AM] Donk: i have had no problems with the desktop player fwiw
[6/21/17, 10:57:48 AM] Miller: the app or web player?
[6/21/17, 10:58:17 AM] Donk: the app
[6/21/17, 10:58:26 AM] Donk: dont know about the mobile app
[6/21/17, 10:59:03 AM] Miller: yea i dont use the desktop app (work computer cant install shit)
[6/21/17, 10:59:08 AM] Miller: im sure that works fine
[6/21/17, 10:59:20 AM] Miller: they changed something w/the web player though so recently started having issues

[6/21/17, 3:09:25 PM] Justin: That guy does to whitehouse
[6/21/17, 3:09:28 PM] Steve: Aight nobody got time for that
[6/21/17, 3:10:04 PM] Dan Watts: shaun king hate group is üî•üî•üî• right now
[6/21/17, 3:10:52 PM] Justin: Some nyt trash hit piece quoted him the other day as a supporter of Bernie.
[6/21/17, 3:11:23 PM] Justin: Shaun king apprently is go to progressive voice in the eyes of nyt
[6/21/17, 3:11:57 PM] Justin: Unstoppable

[6/21/17, 3:19:27 PM] Launchpad: although to be fair, this song is on a concept album about a guy who escapes an insane asylum and wants to exact vengeance on the man who locked him up
[6/21/17, 3:19:41 PM] Launchpad: aka a fictional story
[6/21/17, 3:19:55 PM] Launchpad: still creepy though

[6/21/17, 3:23:51 PM] Launchpad: Al Gore and Hilary Clinton won the popular vote too...
[6/21/17, 3:25:28 PM] Donk: you are implying some sort of election between neil and king diamond that also includes an electoral college, which king diamond will somehow win, even though neil will win the popular vote?
[6/21/17, 3:25:59 PM] Launchpad: dont underestimate the crazies
[6/21/17, 3:58:08 PM] Miller: http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/338747-bloomberg-trump-will-win-reelection-because-democratic-party-will-be-torn
[6/21/17, 4:01:12 PM] Miller: It should be clear to Democrats that the progressive message is not resonating with Independents or blue-collar workers ‚Äî some of whom are within their base. And it is evident that Democrats still haven‚Äôt learned anything from the 2016 presidential election. They decided to stick with Pelosi as House minority leader and elected Tom Perez, whose rhetoric has marginalized non-progressives within his own party, as chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Progressivism is ruining the Democratic Party. It will be interesting to watch how much damage it will do to the brand before the party recognizes that progressivism doesn‚Äôt resonate with the American people, not now, nor will it in 2018 and beyond.
[6/21/17, 4:02:07 PM] Launchpad: Thanks Obama
[6/21/17, 4:05:07 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/21/17, 4:06:46 PM] Steve: I can't help but laugh at progressivism ruining a party
[6/21/17, 4:45:24 PM] Justin: Lol
[6/21/17, 4:46:38 PM] Justin: Yeh multi billionaire knows how "independents "think

[6/21/17, 4:47:24 PM] Justin: And amazing the drum beat already starting in preemptiveness
[6/21/17, 4:47:27 PM] Miller: quote is from thehill writer not michael bbg and came from a different article, i dont know for sure but probably safe to assume thehill writer not a 1x billionaire
[6/21/17, 4:47:40 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/21/17, 4:48:09 PM] Dan Watts: only Shaun King and Linda Sarsour understand the struggle of average americans
[6/21/17, 4:48:22 PM] Steve: ^no one said that
[6/21/17, 4:48:29 PM] Steve: Can you stop putting word in Hermans mouth
[6/21/17, 4:48:33 PM] Steve: He doesn't like that
[6/21/17, 4:48:40 PM] Steve: Please, have some integrity
[6/21/17, 4:49:11 PM] Justin: Seriously. Plus my phone is shattered. I dropped it like 20 minutes ago. Can't even really stick up for myself.
[6/21/17, 4:49:19 PM] Justin: Typing on egg shells
[6/21/17, 4:49:38 PM] Steve: It's ok, I'll handle the fake news police for ya herm
[6/21/17, 4:50:19 PM] Justin: But miller ou posted a article quoting Bloomberg
[6/21/17, 4:50:31 PM] Justin: Then took a quote from a different article ?
[6/21/17, 4:50:43 PM] Miller: yes i read more than 1 article
[6/21/17, 4:51:03 PM] Justin: Lol. But you get how hat would be confusing, right?
[6/21/17, 4:51:06 PM] Miller: you would know that quote was not from the article if you had read it instead of just reacting to a headline
[6/21/17, 4:51:24 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-ossoff-s-loss-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-dems-972620355803
[6/21/17, 4:51:38 PM] Dan Watts: i think this is an accurate analysis
[6/21/17, 4:51:40 PM] Justin: I like morning joe these days.
[6/21/17, 4:51:52 PM] Justin: His wife has pushed him to dark side
[6/21/17, 4:52:03 PM] Steve: Now you are specifically quoting "fake news"?
[6/21/17, 4:52:05 PM] Dan Watts: also i didn't say herman said that, but king and sarsour are prominent voices in the progressive community
[6/21/17, 4:52:07 PM] Steve: What is going on today
[6/21/17, 4:52:50 PM] Steve: Can I see some stats to back those statements up?
[6/21/17, 4:53:35 PM] Dan Watts: shaun king has 700k followers on twitter and has a daily news column
[6/21/17, 4:54:06 PM] Dan Watts: sarsour has a measly 200k but she co-presided over the womens march
[6/21/17, 4:54:48 PM] Steve: So you qualify leader by the followers on twitter?
[6/21/17, 4:54:54 PM] Steve: That seems a bit off
[6/21/17, 4:55:25 PM] Steve: And many people co-presided over the women's march
[6/21/17, 4:55:32 PM] Steve: Can I have some stats please?
[6/21/17, 4:56:16 PM] Justin: Plus never claimed Bloomberg was a leader of anything  just that he isn't in a position to talk about what any normal American goes thru
[6/21/17, 4:56:52 PM] Justin: C wright mills and all
[6/21/17, 4:56:58 PM] Miller: question what if bloomberg says the something you believe is "right"
[6/21/17, 4:57:10 PM] Miller: does it become "wrong" b/c its said by bloomberg and hes rich?
[6/21/17, 4:57:54 PM] Launchpad: Bloomberg IS a leader in terminals
[6/21/17, 4:59:13 PM] Miller: curious where the wealth cutoff is on when you stop being able to speak for "the poeple"
[6/21/17, 4:59:26 PM] Miller: im guessing top 2% bernie and his 3 houses is under whatever line exists
[6/21/17, 4:59:55 PM] Launchpad: not quite news, but this came from a reddit post several years ago
[6/21/17, 5:00:08 PM] Justin: I'm saying it's difficult
[6/21/17, 5:00:12 PM] Miller: so what youre saying is..........fake news!
[6/21/17, 5:00:26 PM] Justin: This isn't groundbreaking political science theory
[6/21/17, 5:00:37 PM] Justin: It's also why we see such disparity between policy and opinion
[6/21/17, 5:00:53 PM] Miller: i wasnt a pol sci major so even non-groundbreaking political science theory is above me so you will need to stoop down to my level
[6/21/17, 5:01:19 PM] Justin: When the phone calls being directed to politicians are by constituents donating 50k+ the pulse of America in the eyes of congress becomes distorted
[6/21/17, 5:01:41 PM] Miller: im still curious where the line is b/w bernie and bloomberg
[6/21/17, 5:01:51 PM] Miller: how rich or not rich would someone have to be to not have gotten that reaction from you
[6/21/17, 5:02:04 PM] Miller: if he had 5m? 10m? 150m? 500m? just a 1x billionare?
[6/21/17, 5:02:20 PM] Justin: There is no cutoff. There is a likelihood
[6/21/17, 5:02:34 PM] Justin: There's past policy positions as well
[6/21/17, 5:03:47 PM] Miller: so much like you do with shaun king why not in this case just ignore the origin of the message and focus on the actual message instead of just attacking the source
[6/21/17, 5:04:28 PM] Justin: Because the message is an echo
[6/21/17, 5:04:29 PM] Launchpad: just putting this out here: Vitalik Buterin will be the next 'worlds youngest (self-made) billionaire'
[6/21/17, 5:05:01 PM] Justin: It's the corporatist wing placing blame on progressives as they claim to know the pulse of Americans
[6/21/17, 5:05:08 PM] Justin: It's not like it's original
[6/21/17, 5:05:15 PM] Miller: lol that you think THAT message is an echo b/c all i see is the "haha trump is so dumb, he has a 30% approval rating, he is so bad, hes a joke, democrats gonna take back everything, trump is gonna get impeached"
[6/21/17, 5:05:24 PM] Miller: thats the echo chamber i personally see the most
[6/21/17, 5:05:47 PM] Miller: and it could not be further from reality
[6/21/17, 5:05:51 PM] Justin: Maybe it's perhaps in my chamber
[6/21/17, 5:06:04 PM] Launchpad: the angry left sounds pretty similar to the angry right when O was in office
[6/21/17, 5:06:11 PM] Justin: Lol
[6/21/17, 5:06:18 PM] Justin: What miller just said isn't the left
[6/21/17, 5:06:32 PM] Justin: The left, my chamber. Isn't saying trump has no Janice
[6/21/17, 5:06:38 PM] Justin: Quite the opposite
[6/21/17, 5:06:37 PM] Miller: i dont think bloomberg (or anyone) trying to "wake people up" to the fact trumps base/supporters are all extremely satisfied with him and they are not going away is a bad thing
[6/21/17, 5:07:30 PM] Miller: i think the non-extreme left mostly all shares that sentiment
[6/21/17, 5:07:35 PM] Justin: Did you read the article you sent?
[6/21/17, 5:07:37 PM] Miller: the media constantly makes fun of him
[6/21/17, 5:07:50 PM] Miller: his approval ratings are ridiculous
[6/21/17, 5:08:35 PM] Miller: yes i understand the basis of the bloomberg article was more about democrats than republicans but to me its all the same shit
[6/21/17, 5:08:39 PM] Justin: 90% is about a shattered left
[6/21/17, 5:08:51 PM] Miller: b/c the idea that republicans who voted for trump no longer back him is inherently a myth
[6/21/17, 5:09:22 PM] Miller: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-6-is-all-about-the-voters-who-reluctantly-backed-trump/
[6/21/17, 5:09:34 PM] Justin: No arguemeny here w that
[6/21/17, 5:12:23 PM] Justin: Let's summaraize Bloomberg and that quote you sents argument. 1 progressives are causin in fighting.  2 people don't vote for progressives. 3 the democrats haven't presented a way forward.
[6/21/17, 5:13:23 PM] Justin: The only way forward is progressive economics. We don't have another option. Republicans have their supply side. Democrats have tried a third way economics. The only other option is progressive demand side economics.
[6/21/17, 5:15:04 PM] Justin: The reason they have t found a way forward is they don't have an economics which silumtaneously can sustain corporate power while promoting economics that help people. There is no policy other than more of the same. "Paraphrase......Given the choice of a republican and a democrat trying to be a republican, the voter will chose he authentic one every time ".
[6/21/17, 5:15:58 PM] Justin: Hence ossloff bullshit middle ground campaign that 30 million dollars couldn't fix.
[6/21/17, 5:16:48 PM] Miller: your fingers bleeding?
[6/21/17, 5:17:03 PM] Justin: Idk still pissed.
[6/21/17, 5:17:20 PM] Justin: Was t even a crazy drop
[6/21/17, 5:17:38 PM] Miller: insurance?
[6/21/17, 5:18:47 PM] Justin: Dropped it as wel
[6/21/17, 5:18:54 PM] Justin: Think only like 150 anyway
[6/21/17, 5:18:59 PM] Justin: Same as deductible pretty much
[6/21/17, 5:19:11 PM] Miller: iphone?
[6/21/17, 5:19:24 PM] Justin: Yeh
[6/21/17, 5:19:32 PM] Miller: which one?
[6/21/17, 5:19:40 PM] Justin: 6+
[6/21/17, 5:20:01 PM] Steve: I can get that fixed for $90
[6/21/17, 5:20:13 PM] Steve: You can pay me the extra $60 for my effort
[6/21/17, 5:20:15 PM] Dan Watts: herman v. apple, cheese filing suit tomorrow
[6/21/17, 5:20:37 PM] Miller: yea they have lots of used/refusbished ones for 100-150
[6/21/17, 5:20:51 PM] Justin: Let apple depose me
[6/21/17, 5:21:21 PM] Miller: thought those phones would be more expensive still, its only 1 model behind right?
[6/21/17, 5:21:23 PM] Launchpad: Apple has billions of dollars cash just laying around
[6/21/17, 5:21:33 PM] Dan Watts: cheese is going to depose everyone in the jobs family
[6/21/17, 5:21:48 PM] Miller: i think you mean bill gates
[6/21/17, 5:21:55 PM] Miller: honest mistake, happens all the time
[6/21/17, 5:22:37 PM] Dan Watts: lol
[6/21/17, 5:22:45 PM] Launchpad: you talking to me or Dan

[6/21/17, 6:41:37 PM] Justin: sounds like socialism to me
[6/21/17, 6:46:12 PM] Justin: could also adequately fund public schools and provide free tution which will drive tution down inn the private sector
[6/21/17, 6:46:56 PM] Launchpad: I think the real answer is make student loan debt forgiven through bankruptcy
[6/21/17, 6:47:07 PM] Launchpad: so schools will have to think hard about who they lend money to
[6/21/17, 6:47:27 PM] Justin: fair although govt holds mos tthese loans now right?
[6/21/17, 6:47:35 PM] Justin: idk what obama did but i think he changed it
[6/21/17, 6:48:07 PM] Justin: holds most these loans* a question for @15166335046
[6/21/17, 6:48:25 PM] Justin: its kinda batshit crazy considering teachers make dick
[6/21/17, 6:49:13 PM] Justin: unvierstiieys could also start charging pharecutical oindustry for doing their rmd
[6/21/17, 6:50:00 PM] Justin: charging big pharma for r&d*
[6/21/17, 6:50:39 PM] Launchpad: how to you make a bill out to an industry...
[6/21/17, 6:51:09 PM] Justin: id assume individual cmpanies contract with state federal govt and schools
[6/21/17, 6:52:03 PM] Launchpad: lol no

[6/21/17, 6:55:36 PM] Justin: decent article
[6/21/17, 6:56:19 PM] Launchpad: "Big Pharma should be asked to reinvest profits back into R&D rather than giving such a high percentage to shareholders."
[6/21/17, 6:56:41 PM] Launchpad: Thats what big companys do - they give money back to shareholders
[6/21/17, 6:57:04 PM] Launchpad: as an investor, you're looking for income or growth
[6/21/17, 6:58:24 PM] Launchpad: You buy shake shack for price appreciation - because you think it will be the next mcdonalds
[6/21/17, 6:58:28 PM] Justin: the point is they are takign advantage of public subsidy
[6/21/17, 6:58:29 PM] Launchpad: you buy mcdonalds for steady income
[6/21/17, 6:58:41 PM] Justin: they wouldnt have no profits if it wasnt for the subsidy
[6/21/17, 6:58:45 PM] Launchpad: what about my industry?
[6/21/17, 6:58:57 PM] Launchpad: what do you base this on...
[6/21/17, 6:58:59 PM] Justin: ?
[6/21/17, 6:59:15 PM] Justin: this more targeted towards the tax exempt subsidy
[6/21/17, 6:59:16 PM] Justin: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/opinion/stop-subsidizing-big-pharma.html
[6/21/17, 6:59:39 PM] Justin: playing poker ill get oyu the numbers, there out there
[6/21/17, 7:00:00 PM] Launchpad: "Drug companies must acknowledge the role of the state ‚Äî and the taxpayer ‚Äî and act accordingly."
[6/21/17, 7:00:02 PM] Launchpad: no they fucken don't
[6/21/17, 7:00:26 PM] Justin: "Venture philanthropy complicates this picture by introducing a tax-exempt loophole. An organization like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation will take in tax-exempt donations to invest in a pharmaceutical company ‚Äî in this case, Vertex Pharmaceuticals ‚Äî to develop drugs based on publicly funded research. Venture philanthropies can then sell the results of that research to private industry to deliver drugs to the market."
[6/21/17, 7:00:52 PM] Justin: your right they dont
[6/21/17, 7:00:57 PM] Justin: hence why govt needs ot put price caps
[6/21/17, 7:01:09 PM] Justin: and make them pay for freeriding
[6/21/17, 7:01:27 PM] Launchpad: cool, then we can afford more bombs
[6/21/17, 7:02:05 PM] Justin: or stopa rguing about ss going bankrupt
[6/21/17, 7:10:45 PM] Justin: i mean the only reason we have patents is the cost of developing intellectual property is so high that absent such government interference, no company would produce the drug
[6/21/17, 7:11:04 PM] Justin: patent law is blatant scoialism
[6/21/17, 7:11:44 PM] Justin: so now we have companies not paying for any research, that are collecting on that govt interference in the operation of the amrket
[6/21/17, 8:08:35 PM] Miller: Just saw someone get hustled for that cd scam, amazing that shit still works
[6/21/17, 8:09:32 PM] Launchpad: cd scam?
[6/21/17, 8:09:43 PM] Launchpad: up and coming rapper selling blank cds on the street?
[6/21/17, 8:10:57 PM] Miller: Not blank

[6/22/17, 10:27:13 AM] Scott: What do u mean
[6/22/17, 10:27:47 AM] Miller: im sure part of making it public is intentionally trying to put him on blast for skipping the exit meeting
[6/22/17, 10:28:00 AM] Steve: I think kristaps missed the exit interview and phils like "oh, you do me like that?"
[6/22/17, 10:28:07 AM] Steve: Wait till you hear I'm trying to trade you
[6/22/17, 10:28:14 AM] Steve: It's all a hoax
[6/22/17, 10:28:23 AM] Steve: Like @17189742074 like to say "fake news"
[6/22/17, 10:28:40 AM] Miller: idk if its a hoax, all he really said was he was listening to trade offers, big difference b/w listening and actively engaging
[6/22/17, 10:28:43 AM] Miller: should always be listening
[6/22/17, 10:29:02 AM] Miller: but like i said im sure he intentionally leaked that information as a shot at KP
[6/22/17, 10:29:16 AM] Miller: jokes on him b/c getting traded from the knicks is like the best thing ever
[6/22/17, 10:29:27 AM] Launchpad: plotting the destroy any remaining value of the team before purchasing it
[6/22/17, 10:29:29 AM] Scott: Said everyone ever
[6/22/17, 10:29:43 AM] Miller: oh no please dont send me to boston or phoenix
[6/22/17, 10:29:58 AM] Steve: Phoenix also sucks
[6/22/17, 10:30:07 AM] Steve: But Boston is a good place
[6/22/17, 10:30:23 AM] Miller: they should trade him and melo to CLE for love
[6/22/17, 10:30:33 AM] Steve: Or Josh Gordon
[6/22/17, 10:30:41 AM] Steve: Guy could ball
[6/22/17, 10:30:42 AM] Miller: fine throw in josh gordon too
[6/22/17, 10:31:23 AM] Miller: all i want is CLE to get melo KP and butler
[6/22/17, 10:31:31 AM] Miller: so they could start those 3 with LBJ and kyrie
[6/22/17, 10:31:34 AM] Miller: and make next years final better
[6/22/17, 10:34:39 AM] Steve: Chauncey "big shot" billups just asked someone to hold his beer
[6/22/17, 10:41:08 AM] Launchpad: lol I went to school with his nephew
[6/22/17, 10:41:17 AM] Launchpad: Billups
[6/22/17, 10:45:33 AM] Miller: https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SENATEHEALTHCARE.pdf here you go @16316620763 the senate HC bill was just released, should give you something to do

[6/22/17, 12:07:10 PM] Steve: Would you trade the #8 for lamarcus Aldridge?
[6/22/17, 12:07:37 PM] Miller: you cant $ wise right?
[6/22/17, 12:07:48 PM] Miller: but no i wouldnt either way
[6/22/17, 12:07:53 PM] Steve: Knicks I think have enough salary cap room
[6/22/17, 12:08:13 PM] Steve: Just wondering if you would do it
[6/22/17, 12:08:22 PM] Steve: I'd consider it and put kristaps at the 5
[6/22/17, 12:08:38 PM] Miller: i wouldnt only bc its just another big veteran contract
[6/22/17, 12:08:41 PM] Steve: And then you keep melo
[6/22/17, 12:08:43 PM] Miller: they need to blow everything up
[6/22/17, 12:09:16 PM] Miller: like BEST CASE scenario melo+kp+LMA + luck they win 50 games or w/e and finish top 4 in the east and arent good enough to beat any of the top 2-3 teams
[6/22/17, 12:09:34 PM] Miller: all you do is have another big salary and a worse draft pick going fwd
[6/22/17, 12:09:43 PM] Steve: They would compete against the cavs and celtics at that point
[6/22/17, 12:09:55 PM] Steve: But not golden state
[6/22/17, 12:10:13 PM] Miller: i dont think theyre on the level of those other teams w/ or w/o LMA
[6/22/17, 12:11:58 PM] Steve: It's golden state
[6/22/17, 12:12:00 PM] Steve: Then cavs
[6/22/17, 12:12:04 PM] Steve: Then everyone else
[6/22/17, 12:12:13 PM] Steve: I think they at least reach everyone else
[6/22/17, 12:12:21 PM] Steve: In terms of playoff teams
[6/22/17, 12:12:25 PM] Steve: But I see your point
[6/22/17, 12:12:39 PM] Steve: And I agree, just curious if you give it one last chance
[6/22/17, 12:12:55 PM] Steve: Since, in any trade with melo, you probably aren't getting equal value.

[6/22/17, 1:07:13 PM] Dan Watts: this was impossible
[6/22/17, 1:07:37 PM] Kiyoon: bish?
[6/22/17, 1:07:50 PM] Kiyoon: well I first thought ok its in your hand
[6/22/17, 1:08:15 PM] Dan Watts: no its actually in the photo, this isn't a trick question
[6/22/17, 1:08:30 PM] Dan Watts: glad someone else had trouble finding it, i thought i might have an innate problem
[6/22/17, 1:10:07 PM] Justin: yeh fuck that
[6/22/17, 1:10:32 PM] Miller: also ive seen that before and the version you sent is actually impossible
[6/22/17, 1:10:37 PM] Miller: they changed the colors or something

[6/22/17, 1:14:49 PM] Miller: phone was so hard i cheated the first time i saw it like 6mo ago, remembered where it was, and still had to cheat again this time

[6/22/17, 1:27:40 PM] Miller: The last Knick draft pick who played more than one year after their first contract term with the Knicks was ... Charlie Ward.
[6/22/17, 1:27:42 PM] Miller: solid #knicksfact
[6/22/17, 1:28:26 PM] Steve: The knicks just don't ever have patience
[6/22/17, 1:59:10 PM] Miller: On ESPN's Outside the Lines, Jay Williams said a top-15 prospect in this draft told him Knicks president Phil Jackson was falling in and out of sleep during a workout.
So he cares more about exit interviews than entrance interviews? Jokes aside, the Knicks couldn't be making a worse case to attract free agents. From throwing their franchise player under the bus to not trying to fix any communication issues with their budding star to arresting a former fan favorite, the past 12 months have been a total disaster. How's it goink?
[6/22/17, 1:59:14 PM] Miller: every part of that is amazing

[6/22/17, 6:45:20 PM] Steve: You just wait

[6/22/17, 6:50:18 PM] Steve: Disgusting
[6/22/17, 6:50:51 PM] Steve: Also, gotta love all these people on social media freaking out about kristaps. How many do you think actually wanted him when Phil and his staff drafted him?
[6/22/17, 6:53:02 PM] Miller: I would trade him for the right price
[6/22/17, 6:53:21 PM] Miller: I would have taken that 4 and Devin booker rumored package
[6/22/17, 6:53:22 PM] Steve: I would trade him for the celtics first, future pick and the two players
[6/22/17, 6:53:27 PM] Steve: In about 2.5 seconds
[6/22/17, 6:55:20 PM] Steve: I hear the celtics have offered 1.3, a future pick and a young player.
[6/22/17, 6:55:34 PM] Steve: I don't know if I'd do that, but I'd consider it
[6/22/17, 6:55:49 PM] Steve: That's three lottery picks presumably for 1
[6/22/17, 7:28:20 PM] Brian Katz: We'll still suck who cares
[6/22/17, 7:53:53 PM] Steve: Big butler trade if it happens
[6/22/17, 7:55:31 PM] Steve: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/22/17, 7:58:56 PM] Miller: Good deal for the Bulls
[6/22/17, 8:04:46 PM] Steve: I think td good for both
[6/22/17, 8:04:53 PM] Steve: I love Ricky Rubio though
[6/22/17, 8:11:38 PM] Miller: How is this Benz e class Uber x this guy's def getting fucked
[6/22/17, 8:28:29 PM] Steve: We got the French guy
[6/22/17, 8:29:09 PM] Miller: Lol I totally forgot the draft was even tonight
[6/22/17, 8:55:57 PM] Tk: Ew..wolves trade. Why? Lavine n #20 for Butler? Why invest in butler when when thay roster is still garbage?
[6/22/17, 8:56:47 PM] Donk: Cant hate on a butler and karl anthony towns combo
[6/22/17, 8:56:55 PM] Steve: And Rubio
[6/22/17, 8:56:58 PM] Steve: Do not forget Rubio
[6/22/17, 8:56:58 PM] Donk: Could ve great together
[6/22/17, 8:57:06 PM] Donk: Eh
[6/22/17, 8:57:09 PM] Donk: Hes okay
[6/22/17, 8:57:09 PM] Steve: Christ
[6/22/17, 8:57:28 PM] Steve: Just tossing the 27 year old Spanish point guard aside
[6/22/17, 8:57:33 PM] Donk: Got that spanish love for Rubio
[6/22/17, 8:57:47 PM] Donk: Hes a decent pg
[6/22/17, 8:57:59 PM] Steve: He's going to be very good
[6/22/17, 8:58:00 PM] Donk: But like the 15th best pg in the league
[6/22/17, 8:58:05 PM] Donk: Hes ok
[6/22/17, 9:35:13 PM] Miller: Didn't they get lavine, 7 overall and Dunn?
[6/22/17, 9:35:33 PM] Steve: Yes
[6/22/17, 9:35:41 PM] Miller: That's pretty solid
[6/22/17, 9:36:16 PM] Scott: Great deal for wolves
[6/22/17, 9:36:23 PM] Scott: And would have taken Devin Booker deal also
[6/22/17, 9:36:35 PM] Scott: It was Booker Chriss and 4th pick
[6/22/17, 9:38:21 PM] Miller: Wasn't Dunn a top 5 or 10 pick last year?
[6/22/17, 9:38:24 PM] Scott: Yes
[6/22/17, 9:38:30 PM] Scott: And guy has crazy talent
[6/22/17, 9:38:44 PM] Scott: But u put towns butler together. That's nuts
[6/22/17, 9:38:57 PM] Scott: And they got that other center who can play and Rubio who can pass
[6/22/17, 9:39:17 PM] Scott: That's def a playoff team that can make noise.
[6/22/17, 9:39:51 PM] Scott: And now watch wade is Go me
[6/22/17, 9:39:54 PM] Scott: Gone
[6/22/17, 9:40:01 PM] Scott: He will be a get for a playoff team
[6/22/17, 9:40:14 PM] Miller: Doubt they can trade him
[6/22/17, 9:40:24 PM] Scott: Waive him
[6/22/17, 9:40:25 PM] Miller: He's making 24m
[6/22/17, 9:40:40 PM] Scott: He's got a player option I think
[6/22/17, 9:40:46 PM] Launchpad: LA got their balls... this should be interesting
[6/22/17, 9:40:46 PM] Miller: He opted in
[6/22/17, 9:40:48 PM] Scott: U waive him. He will want out.
[6/22/17, 9:41:23 PM] Scott: I think he's out. Only makes sense. And out him on like the clippers or  cavs. Jeez
[6/22/17, 9:41:45 PM] Miller: Lol you can't waive someone before they opt in they aren't even on the roster
[6/22/17, 9:42:33 PM] Scott: Are we sure he actually signed it and opted in?
[6/22/17, 9:42:36 PM] Miller: Yes
[6/22/17, 9:42:45 PM] Scott: Blazers made a nice movr
[6/22/17, 9:42:48 PM] Miller: And under no circumstances was he passing up 24m
[6/22/17, 9:42:51 PM] Scott: Getting Zach collins

[6/22/17, 10:08:06 PM] Scott: I got it. Just saying
[6/22/17, 10:08:48 PM] Miller: Talk about a strawman, you're arguing against nobody that wade isn't a top 3 sg
[6/23/17, 6:15:54 AM] Miller: Khaled album out
[6/23/17, 7:34:38 AM] Miller: Keeping the Bieber Rihanna and pusha tracks and other 20 going into the üóë (better hit rate than most Khaled albums) 
Not sure why future and Travis Scott need to be on literally every song. 
It's also kind of impressive he could fit arguably the worst nas, jayz Beyonc√© and Drake songs ever all on the same album.
[6/23/17, 9:23:27 AM] Launchpad: They don't want you to like his album. They don't want him to succeed. They be sabotagin'

[6/23/17, 10:27:19 AM] Brian Katz: Why won't I die already
[6/23/17, 11:25:55 AM] Donk: that rihanna track is the one that samples that santana/rob thomas track from the late 90's/early aughts?
[6/23/17, 11:28:04 AM] Miller: yes
[6/23/17, 11:28:38 AM] Miller: the raekwon/fat joe track he "samples" a week ago from jay but tbh doesnt even sound like he flipped it at all, its basically just the exact same beat
[6/23/17, 11:28:53 AM] Miller: idk who even produced the track so idk who "he" is
[6/23/17, 11:30:05 AM] Donk: yeah i heard it on the radio yesterday
[6/23/17, 11:30:44 AM] Donk: i think i would have prefered the orginal for nostalgia sake
[6/23/17, 11:30:52 AM] Donk: but it wasnt bad
[6/23/17, 11:31:39 AM] Miller: which song? rihanna or fat joe?
[6/23/17, 11:32:23 AM] Donk: rihanna
[6/23/17, 11:33:02 AM] Miller: bryson "pen griffey" tiller about to blow?
[6/23/17, 11:33:18 AM] Miller: wonder if anyone knows hes even on the song lol
[6/23/17, 11:37:42 AM] Steve: He's big timing it

[6/23/17, 11:44:49 AM] Donk: because they had the audacity to be white and sell breakfast burritos
[6/23/17, 11:45:26 AM] Donk: sometimes, people go waaaay to far
[6/23/17, 11:48:11 AM] Launchpad: yeah pretty ridiculous you're going to protest one individual coffee shop as a symbol of gentrification
[6/23/17, 12:09:32 PM] Miller: i love the argument of god forbid anyone could want $15/hr like its an insurmountable amount of $, like the audacity of these people

[6/23/17, 12:16:57 PM] Dan Watts: I think it should be extended beyond fast food industry however
[6/23/17, 12:19:26 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[6/23/17, 12:36:07 PM] Launchpad: 104k a year....not bad
[6/23/17, 12:38:55 PM] Launchpad: the problem is that the laws of supply and demand supersede charity.  $15 an hour fast food workers will only accelerate the use of automated kiosks
[6/23/17, 12:39:36 PM] Donk: which is going to happen anyway
[6/23/17, 12:39:56 PM] Donk: and this isnt only about fast food workers earning aliving wage, but all workers earning a living wage
[6/23/17, 12:41:38 PM] Launchpad: of course
[6/23/17, 12:41:47 PM] Launchpad: Im for a universal basic income
[6/23/17, 12:42:54 PM] Donk: me too, but its going to cause total chaos if we go from nothing entitlement wise to full on universal basic income which is why we should start mkaing baby steps now like universal health care
[6/23/17, 12:43:07 PM] Donk: but thats a whole different conversation
[6/23/17, 12:52:27 PM] Miller: https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/11-ways-that-i-a-white-man-am-not-privileged should be by @16195657200 tbh
[6/23/17, 1:16:26 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQygfZVY4Uw lol at this fucking kid(? could be 13 could be 30 idk)
[6/23/17, 1:23:26 PM] Launchpad: My favorite story about privilege comes from the new season of OITNB.  Its fiction, obviously, but in a flashback, one of the girls is a guest of a friend visiting a different school a couple of towns over.  This school has everything money can buy - this girl had no idea a school could be like that.  Days later, the girl, who was a good student back at her own school, is questioned by a teacher is questioning about why she didn't do her homework.  The girl goes on about this other school, how its unfair they have this and that - and why bother, the game is rigged.
[6/23/17, 1:23:38 PM] Launchpad: Flash forward....shes in jail
[6/23/17, 1:24:07 PM] Steve: Yea so first off
[6/23/17, 1:24:20 PM] Steve: She did her homework and got a D
[6/23/17, 1:24:34 PM] Steve: Secondly, it was a flashback and not the reason why she was in jail
[6/23/17, 1:25:04 PM] Miller: spoilers?
[6/23/17, 1:25:15 PM] Launchpad: lol nah not really
[6/23/17, 1:25:32 PM] Miller: basically no reason to watch it now
[6/23/17, 1:25:39 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/23/17, 1:25:49 PM] Steve: Also that's not white privilege
[6/23/17, 1:26:01 PM] Steve: That's more the system is rigged against minorities
[6/23/17, 1:26:16 PM] Steve: White privilege is what you have
[6/23/17, 1:27:11 PM] Steve: Since you don't know what it is doesn't surprise me you got this confused
[6/23/17, 1:27:49 PM] Launchpad: what do we do about privilege, how do we fix it?
[6/23/17, 1:28:23 PM] Steve: First, have people understand what it is
[6/23/17, 1:28:32 PM] Launchpad: and then?
[6/23/17, 1:28:34 PM] Steve: Which is an uphill battle for you
[6/23/17, 1:28:42 PM] Steve: Let's start with baby steps
[6/23/17, 1:29:40 PM] Launchpad: and then?
[6/23/17, 1:29:52 PM] Launchpad: or is that it?
[6/23/17, 1:29:52 PM] Miller: NO AND THEN
[6/23/17, 1:29:52 PM] Launchpad: we done
[6/23/17, 1:30:03 PM] Launchpad: we all understand privilege, now lets go home
[6/23/17, 1:30:37 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/23/17, 1:31:58 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[6/23/17, 1:32:16 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/23/17, 1:32:22 PM] Launchpad: classic
[6/23/17, 1:34:18 PM] Launchpad: People want so desperately for the world to change -- but they are not willing to change themselves...
[6/23/17, 1:34:55 PM] Steve: And you know I haven't change how?
[6/23/17, 1:35:13 PM] Launchpad: It is exponentially more difficult to get your state or country to state to pay you $15 than it is to make that money on your own
[6/23/17, 1:35:13 PM] Steve: From group chats? Lol
[6/23/17, 1:35:15 PM] Launchpad: Im not saying you
[6/23/17, 1:35:38 PM] Launchpad: I mean the 'life isn't fair' crowd
[6/23/17, 1:36:08 PM] Steve: So you think people should just accept what the state/country gives them and not ever complain?
[6/23/17, 1:36:20 PM] Steve: Or protest or fight for something better?
[6/23/17, 1:36:47 PM] Launchpad: no just direct you energy more efficiently
[6/23/17, 1:37:02 PM] Steve: Why do you believe that's inefficient?
[6/23/17, 1:37:02 PM] Launchpad: if you want $15 an hour, complaining about it won't do much
[6/23/17, 1:37:08 PM] Steve: What if people can do both?
[6/23/17, 1:37:26 PM] Steve: Or what if "complaining" about it actually makes it a reality?
[6/23/17, 1:37:29 PM] Launchpad: they sure can
[6/23/17, 1:37:49 PM] Steve: So you want people to do both or just shut up?
[6/23/17, 1:37:58 PM] Steve: Because you can do it so anyone can?
[6/23/17, 1:38:00 PM] Launchpad: theres a lot more resistance in trying to change the world than yourself
[6/23/17, 1:38:32 PM] Steve: But trying to change just your own life is short sighted and not what living is actually about
[6/23/17, 1:38:39 PM] Steve: That's the same reason people don't do anything
[6/23/17, 1:38:52 PM] Steve: Hey, why recycle? It doesn't help me personally and gives me more work
[6/23/17, 1:43:04 PM] Launchpad: not if you have a family and kids...
[6/23/17, 1:43:23 PM] Launchpad: and even then why is that short sighted?
[6/23/17, 1:47:42 PM] Steve: Because, I believe, all people are put on this world to make a difference whether it's in their community, city, state, country or globally. And just living your life with your head down and doing you always, IMO, is not truly living.
[6/23/17, 1:47:48 PM] Steve: Again, all my opinion.
[6/23/17, 1:49:52 PM] Launchpad: Sure -- but "making a difference" extends beyond complaining
[6/23/17, 1:50:12 PM] Steve: What you label as complaining isn't necessarily that
[6/23/17, 1:50:24 PM] Steve: You don't know what those "complainers" actually do to make a difference
[6/23/17, 1:50:27 PM] Miller: they call it complaining, I call it explaining
[6/23/17, 1:50:40 PM] Steve: You are judging them based on you just not wanting to hear them
[6/23/17, 1:50:42 PM] Steve: Nothing else
[6/23/17, 1:50:44 PM] Launchpad: mansplaining
[6/23/17, 1:51:32 PM] Launchpad: I believe in making a difference through empowering individuals to achieve their full potential
[6/23/17, 1:51:52 PM] Steve: And how are you doing that?
[6/23/17, 1:51:53 PM] Miller: http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/16/technology/youtube-fast-food-reviewer/index.html lol cmon this kid makes 2k/month doing this
[6/23/17, 1:51:59 PM] Steve: By telling them to stop complaining?
[6/23/17, 1:52:05 PM] Steve: Really empowering
[6/23/17, 1:52:10 PM] Steve: Should write a book
[6/23/17, 1:52:21 PM] Donk: if launchpad had been in charge at various points in history, things would have gone very differently
[6/23/17, 1:52:33 PM] Launchpad: all this literature on privilege can self destructive if you let it.  You constantly play this script in your head about
[6/23/17, 1:52:57 PM] Launchpad: how society has it out for you and you can never be what you want until society excepts you first
[6/23/17, 1:52:59 PM] Donk: for example George "Launchpad" Washington says fuck it, what do you mean protesting? the kings in charge, he should always been in charge, red coats for everyone!
[6/23/17, 1:53:19 PM] Donk: protesting and revolution never helped anyone
[6/23/17, 1:55:28 PM] Launchpad: I just think that an empowered group of individuals working as a team will accomplish a lot more than a group of dejected individuals who's power comes from 'strength in numbers'
[6/23/17, 1:56:06 PM] Launchpad: and while I may be a hardass -- I don't disagree with raising minimum wage, UBI, healthcare etc
[6/23/17, 1:56:23 PM] Launchpad: I just don't like people whining about how they are always the victim
[6/23/17, 1:57:30 PM] Steve: You do realize many of the dejected individuals are empowered individuals just tired of getting the shaft right?
[6/23/17, 1:57:33 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kqj9R19rmc
[6/23/17, 1:57:36 PM] Dan Watts: this is excellent
[6/23/17, 1:57:53 PM] Donk: if people dont "complain" there would never be any incentive for anything to change
[6/23/17, 1:58:13 PM] Donk: otherwise the status quo would always remain the same
[6/23/17, 1:58:25 PM] Steve: That's like saying Martin Luther king should have stopped protesting and just worked harder.
[6/23/17, 1:58:25 PM] Donk: its only through highlighting of problems and protest do things actualy change
[6/23/17, 1:58:31 PM] Launchpad: yes - I am typecasting a whole group of people where its not the case with everyone
[6/23/17, 1:58:32 PM] Donk: exactly
[6/23/17, 1:58:38 PM] Steve: Also @17189742074 not entertaining your fake news
[6/23/17, 1:58:42 PM] Donk: things dont just change without some sort of impeteus
[6/23/17, 1:58:52 PM] Steve: Get it out of here like Shaun king
[6/23/17, 1:59:38 PM] Donk: what you are saying launchapd is "dont complain, complaining doesnt work. just put your head down and things will magically change on their own" which we all know is bullshit
[6/23/17, 1:59:56 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/23/17, 2:01:50 PM] Launchpad: DR. Martin Luther had a Ph.D.  Do you really think we would have heard about his fucken dream if he worked the frystation?
[6/23/17, 2:03:41 PM] Donk: but yet you are saying that he should have never protested in the first place
[6/23/17, 2:03:43 PM] Steve: Did everyone who marched with him have it?
[6/23/17, 2:03:46 PM] Donk: regardless of him having a phd
[6/23/17, 2:03:54 PM] Steve: Were they all PHD's?
[6/23/17, 2:04:30 PM] Steve: Or just a handful and the rest were your "complainers"?
[6/23/17, 2:05:03 PM] Launchpad: Im not saying you shouldn't protest at all..I'm saying you should have a 'plan A'
[6/23/17, 2:05:27 PM] Steve: So you are assuming everyone who protests does that first?
[6/23/17, 2:05:30 PM] Steve: That's a bit naive
[6/23/17, 2:05:37 PM] Steve: Don't think that's everyone's first option
[6/23/17, 2:06:59 PM] Launchpad: as I said earlier, I am generalizing a bit
[6/23/17, 2:07:11 PM] Launchpad: not everyone is the same
[6/23/17, 2:07:12 PM] Steve: Well that's one of your many mistakes
[6/23/17, 2:07:17 PM] Steve: Most are not
[6/23/17, 2:07:19 PM] Steve: Some are
[6/23/17, 2:07:25 PM] Steve: Just like bad cops
[6/23/17, 2:07:29 PM] Steve: Or corrupt politicians
[6/23/17, 2:08:00 PM] Steve: Always some people trying to take advantage but to generalize is doing a disservice to the majority
[6/23/17, 2:08:42 PM] Miller: eh i think most politicans are scumbags
[6/23/17, 2:09:00 PM] Miller: maybe not "corrupt" but not good ppl who are completely self serving
[6/23/17, 2:09:08 PM] Steve: Corrupt and scum bag are two different things
[6/23/17, 2:09:10 PM] Miller: well all except one, praise be to him
[6/23/17, 2:09:35 PM] Steve: But politicians may not be he best example
[6/23/17, 2:09:42 PM] Steve: Probably should have stuck with just cops
[6/23/17, 2:13:02 PM] Launchpad: on the flip side, not everyone who is protesting for $15 is an upstanding citizen, just trying to make it by in an unjust world
[6/23/17, 2:13:24 PM] Launchpad: there are plenty of jackasses, criminals, and losers out there doing the bare minimum just to stay employed
[6/23/17, 2:13:45 PM] Steve: But that's the minority
[6/23/17, 2:13:50 PM] Steve: You saying it isn't is fake news
[6/23/17, 2:13:58 PM] Steve: Exactly what @17189742074 fights against
[6/23/17, 2:14:08 PM] Steve: Oh wait, you aren't Shaun king. Nevermind.
[6/23/17, 2:14:13 PM] Steve: He won't care
[6/23/17, 2:14:14 PM] Miller: why does it matter what kind of people they are? has nothing to with whether they should be paid $15/hr or not
[6/23/17, 2:14:25 PM] Miller: there is no "character" requirement for wages
[6/23/17, 2:14:28 PM] Launchpad: maybe
[6/23/17, 2:15:05 PM] Steve: I know a guy in the White House who is a billionaire and is a complete jackass, loser and teetering on criminal.
[6/23/17, 2:15:21 PM] Launchpad: touche
[6/23/17, 2:15:24 PM] Miller: i know a guy like that to except hes not a billionare
[6/23/17, 2:15:54 PM] Miller: id still bet every $ i have HRC has more $ than him
[6/23/17, 2:15:57 PM] Launchpad: like I said -- im not against raising minimum wage - what I'm really against is this script playing out -- this message being sent out that 'if you belong to this group, you're a made man, if you belong to this group, you'll never amount to anything'
[6/23/17, 2:16:19 PM] Steve: That's not the narrative at all
[6/23/17, 2:16:30 PM] Miller: at least not related to the minimum wage at all
[6/23/17, 2:16:41 PM] Launchpad: thats what the narative in these 'privilege' conversation are
[6/23/17, 2:16:43 PM] Miller: how about the narrative that you need to be performing heart surgery to "earn" $15/hr?
[6/23/17, 2:16:47 PM] Steve: The reality is if you are white you have it easier than if you are a minority
[6/23/17, 2:16:48 PM] Launchpad: we kind of mixed the issues
[6/23/17, 2:16:57 PM] Steve: Doesn't mean you can't become as successful
[6/23/17, 2:17:00 PM] Miller: or how cheese wants to hire someone who graduated from law school w/200k in debt for $10/hr
[6/23/17, 2:17:02 PM] Steve: Just means you have it harder
[6/23/17, 2:17:25 PM] Launchpad: and that is true -- but dwelling on it for too long is bad fuel for the brain
[6/23/17, 2:17:42 PM] Miller: and ignoring it is how nothing gets done
[6/23/17, 2:17:46 PM] Miller: so theres that
[6/23/17, 2:18:14 PM] Steve: According to @16195657200 ignoring it and working hard is exactly how everything gets done
[6/23/17, 2:18:48 PM] Miller: like should black people have been like well yea this slavery thing sucks but wtf am i gonna do about it, i might as well just do the best i can and maybe i can get to live in the house and not in the fields and make the best of my situation
[6/23/17, 2:19:28 PM] Miller: by dismissing issues or peoples problems with them as "complaining" is ignorant and demeaning
[6/23/17, 2:19:30 PM] Launchpad: no, I think elevating your own status will gain you more influence and leverage to make a difference than playing victim
[6/23/17, 2:20:06 PM] Steve: Cool, but when you have barriers against that progress just because of the color of your skin it's demoralizing and makes things even more difficult
[6/23/17, 2:20:19 PM] Miller: clearly im not personally ever going to be pulled over and shot by a cop for being black, doesnt mean i dont realize its an issue and respect people who want to fight against it to change it
[6/23/17, 2:20:19 PM] Steve: All I'm saying is a level playing field should be fought for
[6/23/17, 2:20:24 PM] Steve: No one is playing victim
[6/23/17, 2:20:27 PM] Steve: It's a fact
[6/23/17, 2:20:29 PM] Miller: vs me complaining about their "complaining"
[6/23/17, 2:20:52 PM] Steve: Timmy point, agreed
[6/23/17, 2:21:04 PM] Steve: Or to a lesser extent with loans
[6/23/17, 2:21:13 PM] Steve: As proven my many many civil cases
[6/23/17, 2:21:19 PM] Steve: Minorities are targeted
[6/23/17, 2:21:23 PM] Steve: Because of what?
[6/23/17, 2:21:27 PM] Steve: They complain too much?
[6/23/17, 2:21:32 PM] Steve: They don't work hard enough?
[6/23/17, 2:25:47 PM] Donk: yeah there are plenty of people out there who probably work way harder than all of us and earn considerably less
[6/23/17, 2:26:10 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[6/23/17, 2:26:13 PM] Steve: Multiple jobs
[6/23/17, 2:26:19 PM] Steve: And still don't go on vacations
[6/23/17, 2:26:26 PM] Steve: Don't have cars
[6/23/17, 2:26:41 PM] Launchpad: as I've said before -- theres a difference between working hard & working smart
[6/23/17, 2:27:16 PM] Launchpad: create a business selling stuff on Fiver
[6/23/17, 2:27:30 PM] Launchpad: that involves using your brain -- but anyone could do it
[6/23/17, 2:27:43 PM] Launchpad: some people don't like to think, so they use 'working hard' as an excuse
[6/23/17, 2:28:17 PM] Steve: Again with this "some people"
[6/23/17, 2:28:28 PM] Steve: And these ideas that these people make up the majority
[6/23/17, 2:28:36 PM] Steve: They don't
[6/23/17, 2:28:41 PM] Steve: And they haven't ever
[6/23/17, 2:30:09 PM] Steve: Again bad apples, bad people, lazy people will always exist. But to generalize and say those are all the people "complaining" is wrong and ignorant.
[6/23/17, 2:30:22 PM] Steve: And I'd like to think you are smarter than that.
[6/23/17, 2:34:50 PM] Launchpad: @15166335046 https://www.fiverr.com/jwilson40/create-a-winning-dfs-lineup?context=adv.cat_7.subcat_279&context_type=rating&source=category_tree&ref_ctx_id=c3767558-5a55-47c4-ac82-7818c3cf7202&filtered_price=&pckg_id=1&pos=7&funnel=7820f9f8-d44b-42c1-aa55-c113b00a0f28
[6/23/17, 2:36:29 PM] Miller: to think ive been giving my secrets away to you idiots for free
[6/23/17, 2:39:14 PM] Launchpad: I think the difference between me and you is that you want to help improve a bad situation for all those involved, whereas I want to help individuals elevate themselves beyond that bad situation
[6/23/17, 2:41:48 PM] Justin: the difeence between you and most these people you are throwing into a collective is life
[6/23/17, 2:42:14 PM] Justin: you can't undue early pregnancy
[6/23/17, 2:42:32 PM] Justin: and while you may now claim those were bad choices...well that kills your arugment than doesnt it
[6/23/17, 2:43:10 PM] Justin: becuase you seem to think there is some magical light switch, once turned, life becomes a gudied spiritual journey of self discovery and triumph
[6/23/17, 2:43:31 PM] Launchpad: sure -- but I don't think someones bad decisions in the past have to be prison sentences in the future (unless you were actually sentenced to prison)
[6/23/17, 2:43:42 PM] Justin: but they are extremely limiting
[6/23/17, 2:44:04 PM] Justin: when you need to work 14 hours a day to put food on the table, going to school isnt really an option
[6/23/17, 2:44:05 PM] Launchpad: there is.  But its not a straight uphill path
[6/23/17, 2:44:20 PM] Justin: getting a loan isnt an option
[6/23/17, 2:44:28 PM] Justin: making arisky investment isnt an option
[6/23/17, 2:44:55 PM] Launchpad: theres always good old fashioned hustling
[6/23/17, 2:45:03 PM] Justin: and a large majority of americans over the age of say 25 working for minimum wage, will fall intoa  category of amking a bad decision when they were young
[6/23/17, 2:45:16 PM] Justin: unless they are applying for paralegal job
[6/23/17, 2:46:14 PM] Launchpad: https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/792907369311272960?lang=en
[6/23/17, 2:47:08 PM] Launchpad: Gary V has been encouraging his readers to hustle by finding shit in thrift stores & garage sales and reselling them on ebay
[6/23/17, 2:47:11 PM] Launchpad: no education required
[6/23/17, 2:47:45 PM] Justin: but is that a practical solution for a large scale process?
[6/23/17, 2:48:03 PM] Justin: market economics would clearly indicate it isnt
[6/23/17, 2:48:40 PM] Justin: and once again, you have no car, public transporation fees are increasing, and you work 12 hours a day
[6/23/17, 2:48:45 PM] Launchpad: no and like I said before -- the difference between my and steves argument: my solutions are for the individual to elevate their status
[6/23/17, 2:48:48 PM] Justin: when exactly are you giong to thrift shops?
[6/23/17, 2:49:00 PM] Miller: no no i think the making bad decisions while young applies there also :)
[6/23/17, 2:49:12 PM] Justin: yeh i was ognna say that
[6/23/17, 2:49:23 PM] Justin: lol, figured id leave that to cheese but thanks miller lol
[6/23/17, 2:49:53 PM] Miller: no education required just internet access, money to purchase something upfront, enough capital to take losses when people scam you etc... etc..
[6/23/17, 2:50:04 PM] Launchpad: you can get to work
[6/23/17, 2:50:34 PM] Justin: most welfare right to work states madate wrk as far as 1-2 hours away form homes
[6/23/17, 2:50:51 PM] Launchpad: sure...you need minimum capital...if you don't have that, hustle until you do
[6/23/17, 2:51:17 PM] Justin: and once agian if that market was saturated with say double its current total sellers.....prices on goods would fall through floor
[6/23/17, 2:52:04 PM] Justin: and ive talked to ebay sellers and they have said that if you dont get items at wholesale in large quantity, you dont have a business
[6/23/17, 2:52:11 PM] Launchpad: if you're that desperate than panhandle until you've got that minimum amount of capitol
[6/23/17, 2:52:21 PM] Miller: sounds like welfare to me
[6/23/17, 2:52:27 PM] Justin: the ebay fees are insane and liability is almost always on seller
[6/23/17, 2:52:54 PM] Miller: "if youre that desperate just rent a limo and rob people in vegas"
[6/23/17, 2:53:00 PM] Launchpad: sell it on craigslist
[6/23/17, 2:53:38 PM] Launchpad: as I said -- my solution is for the individual looking to elevate their own individual status
[6/23/17, 2:53:40 PM] Launchpad: I am NOT trying to fix all the worlds problems
[6/23/17, 2:54:10 PM] Miller: thats fine but dont insinuate your might-work-on-5%-of-people solution is a viable alternative
[6/23/17, 2:54:29 PM] Miller: like why dont all poor black people just become professional athletes? its how michael oher got himself out of a tough situation
[6/23/17, 2:55:42 PM] Justin: fair, and even thogh that exampke is likely a failed business model for most.. that doesn't change the underlying premise you are making.....in theory attepting to change ones position will always be more effective than not attempting
[6/23/17, 2:55:42 PM] Miller: dont like the situation in cuba? just become a prof MLB player and flee to america
[6/23/17, 2:56:12 PM] Launchpad: It can work for anyone. It just can't work for everyone
[6/23/17, 2:56:50 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/23/17, 2:56:51 PM] Launchpad: what do you fucken do? Give up? Admit defeat? Cry? Go home?
[6/23/17, 2:57:00 PM] Justin: im agreeing with you
[6/23/17, 2:57:04 PM] Launchpad: you can't turn your life around overnight
[6/23/17, 2:57:13 PM] Justin: i mean im agreeing with your premise
[6/23/17, 2:57:14 PM] Launchpad: but you gotta start somewhere
[6/23/17, 2:57:25 PM] Justin: i dont think its realistic, but its accurate statement
[6/23/17, 2:57:49 PM] Justin: I mean life cant get all that much worse than being on welfare
[6/23/17, 2:58:17 PM] Justin: so net negative on trying something versus gain clearly makes it an ev move....but slightly ev moves may not be practical in reality
[6/23/17, 2:58:49 PM] Justin: like were at the bar the other day... they are foerring 2400$ to roll a 1-600 roll
[6/23/17, 2:59:04 PM] Justin: techincally you should sit there all day rolling, but would you?
[6/23/17, 2:59:35 PM] Launchpad: pretty sure if you're making $7 an hour you're not thinking about EV
[6/23/17, 2:59:53 PM] Launchpad: and I assume $1 a roll, so you should keep rolling until you hit
[6/23/17, 3:00:29 PM] Miller: only ~1900
[6/23/17, 3:00:32 PM] Justin: yeh you should, but with variance not hitting beore 2400 probably happens like 35% time
[6/23/17, 3:00:38 PM] Miller: and they only allow you to do 1 per person
[6/23/17, 3:00:44 PM] Justin: fair enough 20% house take
[6/23/17, 3:00:52 PM] Justin: it was an example miller stop killing it
[6/23/17, 3:01:07 PM] Miller: just getting the üì† straight
[6/23/17, 3:02:14 PM] Launchpad: So what you're saying is you should be afraid of failing and instead not do anything and be safe
[6/23/17, 3:02:21 PM] Launchpad: or at least thats the underlying message I'm getting
[6/23/17, 3:04:08 PM] Justin: no im saying realizing equity isnt always realistic
[6/23/17, 3:04:25 PM] Justin: so your ebay example probably has 5% sucess rate 95% failure rate
[6/23/17, 3:04:55 PM] Justin: maybe in the end its slighty ev, but what is the overall risk of failure- if it means you cant feed your kid-its clearly not worth it
[6/23/17, 3:05:06 PM] Justin: think of will smith in pursuit of happiness
[6/23/17, 3:05:21 PM] Justin: worked out great, but what if he didnt beat out the 15 people?
[6/23/17, 3:05:46 PM] Miller: still had that fresh prince $ to fall back on
[6/23/17, 3:05:59 PM] Justin: and his uncle phils crib
[6/23/17, 3:08:09 PM] Launchpad: again, literally one example of something someone can do to make money
[6/23/17, 3:08:34 PM] Justin: if we take scuess rate of first businesses---gonna e close to that overall
[6/23/17, 3:08:53 PM] Justin: maybe 10% success
[6/23/17, 3:09:56 PM] Launchpad: ^^ theres a difference between a company and a hustle you can pick up at any time to put a few extra dollars in your pocket
[6/23/17, 3:11:04 PM] Launchpad: do you personally know anyone who works 14 hours a day to put food on the table?
[6/23/17, 3:11:07 PM] Justin: fair enough
[6/23/17, 3:11:11 PM] Justin: i dont know anyone on welfare
[6/23/17, 3:11:19 PM] Justin: so not really a good person to ask
[6/23/17, 3:13:23 PM] Launchpad: probably also not a person who should be telling people they have to stay in their minimum wage jobs instead of side hustlin
[6/23/17, 3:16:09 PM] Donk: forget wage reform
[6/23/17, 3:16:13 PM] Donk: forget minimum wage issues
[6/23/17, 3:16:28 PM] Donk: step 1: go to garage sale
[6/23/17, 3:16:31 PM] Donk: step 2: ?
[6/23/17, 3:16:34 PM] Donk: step 3: profit
[6/23/17, 3:17:47 PM] Launchpad: My point is that if you want $15 an hour, you can get it yourself a lot faster then waiting for the world to catch up around you
[6/23/17, 3:20:06 PM] Steve: No one is waiting!
[6/23/17, 3:20:23 PM] Steve: Holy shit I can't believe you keep not reading and saying the same thing over and over again
[6/23/17, 3:20:33 PM] Steve: It's mind bottling
[6/23/17, 3:20:47 PM] Steve: Protesting is the opposite of waiting
[6/23/17, 3:20:54 PM] Steve: Going on strike is the opposite of waiting
[6/23/17, 3:21:14 PM] Steve: Talking to your local politicians and expressing your want and needs is the opposite of waiting
[6/23/17, 3:22:21 PM] Launchpad: AS AN INDIVIDUAL, protesting is a horrible way to get $15 an hour. Again, my advice is for individuals, not the collective
[6/23/17, 3:22:43 PM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/23/17, 3:22:45 PM] Steve: Thank god no one listens to you
[6/23/17, 3:23:22 PM] Launchpad: if they did they'd be making more than $7 an hour
[6/23/17, 3:24:03 PM] Steve: Who has listened to you and that's happened?
[6/23/17, 3:24:06 PM] Steve: Stats please
[6/23/17, 3:24:21 PM] Steve: And no one is making $7 an hour unless you are a waiter
[6/23/17, 3:24:27 PM] Steve: Then you make your money on tips
[6/23/17, 3:24:34 PM] Miller: more like $2.15/hr
[6/23/17, 3:24:48 PM] Steve: Fake news watts again
[6/23/17, 3:24:54 PM] Launchpad: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[6/23/17, 3:24:54 PM] Steve: #fakenewswatts
[6/23/17, 3:25:36 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/23/17, 3:26:08 PM] Launchpad: Katz took my advice and has lost ~70 pounds.  But thats because he's a personally empowered badass who put in the work himself and didn't expect anyone else to give him permission
[6/23/17, 3:26:19 PM] Dan Watts: @15166335046 was your google search "protester stupid sign" lmao bc thats what mine was and basically got same hits
[6/23/17, 3:27:29 PM] Miller: it was not
[6/23/17, 3:27:34 PM] Miller: it was stupid protest signs
[6/23/17, 3:27:38 PM] Brian Katz: 75lbs Scotty as if this morning. Hit 250, plus was able to run 2.5 miles yesterday
[6/23/17, 3:27:53 PM] Miller: technically you gave him permission
[6/23/17, 3:28:41 PM] Steve: Lol so getting gainful employment is the same as losing 70 pounds? Lol
[6/23/17, 3:28:42 PM] Steve: Ok
[6/23/17, 3:28:45 PM] Steve: Well I'm done
[6/23/17, 3:29:18 PM] Steve: I think I've listened to your backwards thinking enough today
[6/23/17, 3:29:42 PM] Miller: if the people making $10/hr just applied themselves and tried harder and had more willpower they too could ~make $15/hr~ lose 75lbs
[6/23/17, 3:29:54 PM] Launchpad: lol ok...how have you helped the minimum wage class...by arguing with me?
[6/23/17, 3:31:17 PM] Steve: I don't need to state what I do in this forum
[6/23/17, 3:31:26 PM] Steve: If you want to hear what I do, I can tell you privately
[6/23/17, 3:31:41 PM] Steve: If you don't care, then that's on you
[6/23/17, 3:32:15 PM] Justin: Yeh I'm down 30 pounds, stronger across all my lifts, and would like to thank Ronald McDonald and all the free time from being self employed for empowering me
[6/23/17, 3:32:26 PM] Sean: NY is know $7.50 I believe
[6/23/17, 3:32:49 PM] Steve: And again, this isn't a dick measuring competition as to who dos more/less. It's a fact of life that you refuse to acknowledge and think it's solely based on laziness or being a loser.
[6/23/17, 3:33:05 PM] Brian Katz: Where you at herman on the scale?
[6/23/17, 3:33:17 PM] Justin: Idk haven't looked
[6/23/17, 3:33:33 PM] Brian Katz: Am I going to catch you?
[6/23/17, 3:33:34 PM] Launchpad: Its also a fact of life that you keep painting people as helpless victims
[6/23/17, 3:33:59 PM] Steve: I'm not doing that at all
[6/23/17, 3:34:02 PM] Launchpad: you're going to catch me soon at the rate we're both going  üòÇ
[6/23/17, 3:34:13 PM] Steve: I'm saying these barriers exist
[6/23/17, 3:34:21 PM] Steve: And people like you make t worse by denying it
[6/23/17, 3:34:28 PM] Steve: Kind of like climate change deniers
[6/23/17, 3:34:39 PM] Steve: You aren't making it better by saying it's not a thing
[6/23/17, 3:34:42 PM] Justin: Accepted you will catch me. Not of concern.
[6/23/17, 3:35:32 PM] Launchpad: I don't disagree that barriers exist.  The difference is that you make this barriers into insurmountable obstacles, rather that just plain ole barriers
[6/23/17, 3:35:41 PM] Steve: No I don't
[6/23/17, 3:35:57 PM] Steve: Please reply to a comment where I said "insurmountable obstacles"
[6/23/17, 3:36:07 PM] Steve: And please also define plain old barriers
[6/23/17, 3:36:50 PM] Donk: i dont understand how you think its ok for some groups of people to be presented with plain old barriers, but not for others
[6/23/17, 3:37:18 PM] Brian Katz: Cmon Scotty get that fire back lol
[6/23/17, 3:37:28 PM] Justin: That's an interesting discussion which we never talk about -can anything be done
[6/23/17, 3:38:09 PM] Brian Katz: Don't accept that shit herman! Beat me, it's no fun when the other guy ain't trying.
[6/23/17, 3:38:24 PM] Miller: Don't worry katz I'll be slapping carbs out of his hand all weekend in Austin
[6/23/17, 3:39:01 PM] Brian Katz: Miller lite slapping carbs out of hands lol
[6/23/17, 3:39:07 PM] Launchpad: stay away from my brisket
[6/23/17, 3:39:18 PM] Justin: Well go shirtless when we meet at 230, see if you want to change direction
[6/23/17, 3:39:45 PM] Miller: No homo?
[6/23/17, 3:39:59 PM] Steve: Sword fights?
[6/23/17, 3:40:26 PM] Brian Katz: I'll go shirtless right now heavier than you
[6/23/17, 3:41:43 PM] Justin: Do I get Snapchat filters?
[6/23/17, 3:42:06 PM] Brian Katz: What? Only bitches use Snapchat filters
[6/23/17, 3:42:40 PM] Justin: Missing out on crucial game
[6/23/17, 3:42:46 PM] Justin: Lp knows about the filters
[6/23/17, 3:52:30 PM] Launchpad: dog ear filters are for bitches
[6/23/17, 3:53:42 PM] Miller: What about flower crowns?
[6/23/17, 3:53:57 PM] Launchpad: def for bitches
[6/23/17, 3:54:54 PM] Brian Katz: What filters are for dudes?
[6/23/17, 3:55:20 PM] Launchpad: 2 hot chicks in your arms
[6/23/17, 4:03:05 PM] Miller: Standing room only on the cannonball train today, glad I got a seat
[6/23/17, 4:04:44 PM] Miller: At least the people standing are in groups and drinking, could be worse
[6/23/17, 4:18:42 PM] Donk: was it while doing whip-its?
[6/23/17, 4:19:15 PM] Launchpad: close
[6/23/17, 4:19:16 PM] Launchpad: baking a cake
[6/23/17, 4:20:43 PM] Donk: im confused on how this happened
[6/23/17, 4:20:47 PM] Donk: did she put it in the oven?
[6/23/17, 4:21:19 PM] Launchpad: no the pressurized can just exploded
[6/23/17, 4:24:44 PM] Dan Watts: definitely whip its
[6/23/17, 4:39:38 PM] Brian Katz: Shit is crazy @15166335046
[6/23/17, 6:27:27 PM] Launchpad: http://www.barstoolsports.com/boston/trump-plays-by-his-own-rules-when-he-plays-golf-and-they-are-fantastic/
[6/23/17, 6:27:35 PM] Launchpad: Savage
[6/23/17, 6:31:14 PM] Steve: Not surprising you like trump
[6/23/17, 6:31:27 PM] Steve: Only surprising thing is @17189742074 hasn't joined you
[6/23/17, 6:41:49 PM] Dan Watts: I don't like trump but I can't promise I won't grab some pussies in Austin
[6/23/17, 6:42:10 PM] Steve: Well then you probably aren't coming back home bail free
[6/23/17, 6:46:43 PM] Brian Katz: The art of the pussy grab
[6/23/17, 6:46:50 PM] Steve: Not an art
[6/23/17, 6:46:55 PM] Steve: Sexual assault
[6/23/17, 6:48:28 PM] Brian Katz: It's an art, ask Trump
[6/23/17, 6:48:59 PM] Launchpad: except I've never actually said that
[6/23/17, 6:49:09 PM] Launchpad: or even implied it
[6/23/17, 6:49:18 PM] Launchpad: only that his golf rules are savage
[6/23/17, 6:49:28 PM] Steve: Some things are just implied
[6/23/17, 6:49:53 PM] Steve: Also, sexual assault is not an art
[6/23/17, 6:50:08 PM] Steve: But don't believe me, ask the women in your life what they think
[6/23/17, 6:50:16 PM] Brian Katz: There's an art to anything
[6/23/17, 6:51:10 PM] Brian Katz: First you got to have a load a dough, then be in a position of power. Then you Cup your hand slowly but firmly grab the pussy
[6/23/17, 6:51:15 PM] Brian Katz: It's a tricky move
[6/23/17, 6:51:33 PM] Steve: You're not even a little funny
[6/23/17, 6:51:42 PM] Steve: It's actually disturbing you'd even troll about it
[6/23/17, 6:51:45 PM] Steve: But keep going
[6/23/17, 6:51:45 PM] Brian Katz: I'm a lot funny, you're right
[6/23/17, 6:51:56 PM] Steve: I'm sure it makes you feel good joking about it
[6/23/17, 6:51:57 PM] Launchpad: Do I think hes a pompous asshole? Yes.  Do I think hes good for the country? No.  Do I think its hilarious the way the left freaks out over his antics the same way the right did over Obama? Sometimes
[6/23/17, 6:52:52 PM] Steve: You think what he's done is what Obama has done?
[6/23/17, 6:53:13 PM] Steve: Now that's funny!
[6/23/17, 6:53:31 PM] Steve: Don't get me wrong, Obama made mistakes as a president
[6/23/17, 6:53:47 PM] Steve: But at least he was a halfway decent man
[6/23/17, 6:54:02 PM] Steve: Trump is a disgusting piece of garbage
[6/23/17, 6:54:25 PM] Steve: Who sounds like katz trolling but is actually just speaking his truth
[6/23/17, 6:55:05 PM] Steve: No one is freaking out here, just stating what he is
[6/23/17, 6:57:11 PM] Launchpad: what do you think would have happened had the snowden revelations came out with Trump in office
[6/23/17, 6:57:17 PM] Launchpad: People would lose their fucken shit
[6/23/17, 6:57:45 PM] Launchpad: drone murders - obama liked to bomb brown people too
[6/23/17, 6:57:55 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/23/17, 6:58:15 PM] Launchpad: whats the worst thing trump has done?
[6/23/17, 6:58:25 PM] Steve: Let me get back to you after my haircut
[6/23/17, 7:02:03 PM] Launchpad: my point is not that Trump is a better president than Obama. He's not. My point is that liberals today said like conservatives of 4 years ago
[6/23/17, 7:02:24 PM] Launchpad: they overlooked all his flaws cause hes just so gosh darn progressive
[6/23/17, 7:03:12 PM] Dan Watts: I'm getting a freshy too
[6/23/17, 7:07:12 PM] Miller: Guess I got my cut a week too early, everyone gonna be making me look bad in Austin
[6/23/17, 7:07:27 PM] Miller: Thank God for @16195657200 üòú
[6/23/17, 7:07:51 PM] Launchpad: Oh no I'm gonna have a fresh cut too
[6/23/17, 7:21:36 PM] Steve: I'm not saying that you are saying that
[6/23/17, 7:21:56 PM] Steve: My point is the guy has only been in office 150 days an you already think he's worse
[6/23/17, 7:22:11 PM] Steve: Let me ask you these questions before I answer yours from before
[6/23/17, 7:22:25 PM] Steve: Would Obama have gotten elected had he said he grabs women by the pussy?
[6/23/17, 7:23:01 PM] Launchpad: who knows.....but have you ever said anything that bad?
[6/23/17, 7:23:04 PM] Steve: Would would Obama have been elected had he degraded any and all women?
[6/23/17, 7:23:09 PM] Launchpad: perhaps while living in a fraternity house?
[6/23/17, 7:23:15 PM] Steve: But I'm not running for president of the United States
[6/23/17, 7:23:16 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/23/17, 7:23:22 PM] Launchpad: we've all said stupid shit before
[6/23/17, 7:23:23 PM] Steve: I expect more of that person
[6/23/17, 7:23:28 PM] Steve: Sorry if that's crazy
[6/23/17, 7:23:38 PM] Steve: It's not that he just said that
[6/23/17, 7:23:41 PM] Steve: He believes it
[6/23/17, 7:24:31 PM] Steve: He started the brother movement solely based on the color of obamas skin
[6/23/17, 7:24:38 PM] Launchpad: Obama is definitely the better speaker
[6/23/17, 7:24:43 PM] Steve: And thinks climate change is a hoax
[6/23/17, 7:24:52 PM] Steve: *birther
[6/23/17, 7:25:04 PM] Steve: Literally for 5 years trumpnsaid Obama was Kenyan
[6/23/17, 7:25:20 PM] Steve: But it's just words right?
[6/23/17, 7:25:26 PM] Steve: It's not his actions right?
[6/23/17, 7:25:50 PM] Launchpad: again, Im not defending him, hes a prick
[6/23/17, 7:25:58 PM] Steve: I could keep going but I'd sound like a broken record
[6/23/17, 7:26:14 PM] Launchpad: however, its only been 150 days so its early, but as of now his bark has been worse than his bite
[6/23/17, 7:26:19 PM] Steve: But in terms of obamas mistakes, he made plenty
[6/23/17, 7:26:37 PM] Steve: Including drone strikes killing civilians
[6/23/17, 7:26:46 PM] Steve: And the Snowden mess
[6/23/17, 7:26:49 PM] Steve: And Benghazi
[6/23/17, 7:26:53 PM] Steve: Among others
[6/23/17, 7:27:21 PM] Steve: But you think colluding with Russia to win an election is less important?
[6/23/17, 7:27:35 PM] Steve: Sorry, for you trumpeters "colluding with Russia"
[6/23/17, 7:27:44 PM] Launchpad: allegedly...
[6/23/17, 7:27:45 PM] Steve: Don't want you to get your panties is a bunch about it
[6/23/17, 7:27:58 PM] Steve: Imagine if that was obama lol
[6/23/17, 7:28:10 PM] Launchpad: then the left wouldn't care
[6/23/17, 7:28:16 PM] Steve: Right
[6/23/17, 7:28:18 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/23/17, 7:28:27 PM] Launchpad: and fox news would be all over it
[6/23/17, 7:28:34 PM] Steve: Because he left didn't care about obamas mistakes
[6/23/17, 7:29:30 PM] Steve: Politics will always be played
[6/23/17, 7:30:16 PM] Steve: Remember when the right complained about obamas golfing too much?
[6/23/17, 7:30:22 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/23/17, 7:30:36 PM] Steve: Anyway
[6/23/17, 7:30:45 PM] Steve: I got a fresh cut and feel good about Friday
[6/23/17, 7:30:52 PM] Steve: Austin is going to be great
[6/23/17, 7:31:03 PM] Steve: Let's just hope @17189742074 doesn't pull a trump
[6/23/17, 7:45:50 PM] Tk: Everyone is bailing on the Clippers. Griffin now CP3
[6/23/17, 7:46:21 PM] Dan Watts: There's going to be unequivocal consent
[6/23/17, 7:46:23 PM] Dan Watts: As always
[6/23/17, 7:52:28 PM] Dan Watts: Has anyone heard from cheese?
[6/23/17, 7:52:58 PM] Dan Watts: He's not fulfilling his obligations to cheese wizz right now
[6/23/17, 8:01:34 PM] Steve: He's probably fulfilling his obligation to the lady right about own
[6/23/17, 8:01:37 PM] Steve: *now
[6/23/17, 8:52:37 PM] Dan Watts: Sad!
[6/23/17, 9:04:50 PM] Scott: I was having sex
[6/23/17, 9:04:54 PM] Scott: My bad watts
[6/23/17, 9:05:14 PM] Steve: How I know cheezus
[6/23/17, 9:05:14 PM] Scott: On another note anyone wanna chill?
[6/23/17, 9:05:35 PM] Scott: She want to the jersey shore to see her family about 5 mins ago
[6/23/17, 9:47:00 PM] Miller: Missed ~59~ 0 messages
[6/23/17, 11:02:37 PM] Kiyoon: My friends are at a bachelor party there, better hope they don't Mr. Steal yo girl
[6/24/17, 12:06:56 AM] Justin: @16313981203 https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/game-of-thrones-pub-pop-up-bar-open-in-dc
[6/24/17, 12:09:46 AM] Justin: this cant be a serius comment
[6/24/17, 12:13:01 AM] Miller: Yo @16313981203 what in the ever loving fuck are you talking about
[6/24/17, 12:21:18 AM] Justin: @16195657200 trump is destroying medicaide and the healthcare system, next hes repealing the estate tax, hes starved every single govt agency of funds and crippled them including the EPA, In every single major position an individual or lobbyist that wants to abolish all regulation or make inept all regulation regarding said industries has been appointed........He attempted to ban an entire religion from entering our country, and appointed a hearltess dickhead to the supreme court.  catching my breath hes escalated the war in Syria, is pulling us out of our Iran deal, pulling us out of Cuba deal, pulled us out of the paris agreements.  He's attempting to create a voucher system for public school system and destroy what is left of funding for public schools while promoting private charter schools and destroying the teaching profession.  He's going to attempt to link a infrastructure bill with the repeal of davis bacon and prevailing wages laws fully destorying what is left of the working class, while selling the rights to those roadways to private organizations to charge us tolls on literally every road they reinvest in.  On top of that he's done everything Obama did wrong in terms of killing brown people, so yeah great comparison.
[6/24/17, 12:28:17 AM] Justin: when you once again draw a false equivalence this time comparing the rage of the left to the rage of the right against Obama, you sound like this.......... https://www.facebook.com/OccupyDemocrats/videos/1590731961019852/    Meanwhile hate to break the news  but "liberals" were calling out Obama every step of the way,  from his economic appointments and policies to his crackdown on freedom of the press and his foreign policy.....but why allow facts to get in the way.
[6/24/17, 12:35:33 AM] Justin: Meanwhile the halls of the alt right and academic libertarian right range from cheers to silent smirking because both are just disguised ideology's hiding behind a supposed principle's of freedom which they immediately abandon then they get what they want.  On one end the end goal of racist policies and the other end tax cuts and controlling corporate socialism......üé§üé§........
[6/24/17, 1:05:04 AM] Launchpad: I appreciate the effort in this -many good points. But you still sound like the right.
[6/24/17, 1:41:54 AM] Brian Katz: Damn I just finished cooking and you guys were talking some serious Trump/Obama talk.
[6/24/17, 1:43:22 AM] Steve: @17189742074 women at meat packing are on point tonight

[6/25/17, 6:26:04 PM] Justin: As long as you realize he's a prop, who cares

[6/26/17, 10:07:01 AM] Donk: the beginning when he cant understand that guy from migos is hilarious
[6/26/17, 10:07:55 AM] Donk: also, joe buddens new career as rap's "Get Off My Lawn" old man is great
[6/26/17, 10:08:32 AM] Miller: its literally a recreation of the lil jon chapelle interview
[6/26/17, 10:09:08 AM] Miller: the end is too funny migos like alright hold on let me take off all my jewlery and my heels and roll up my floral print sleeves and lets go
[6/26/17, 11:25:41 AM] Launchpad: fucked up man, just gave me the boot like that

[6/26/17, 12:41:10 PM] Justin: lol at posting the one study that shows that
[6/26/17, 12:42:42 PM] Launchpad: "This strikes me as a study that is likely to influence people," said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research. He called the work "very credible" and "sufficiently compelling in its design and statistical power that it can change minds."
[6/26/17, 12:42:44 PM] Launchpad: boom
[6/26/17, 12:42:49 PM] Launchpad: "very credible"
[6/26/17, 12:43:04 PM] Launchpad: end of story, discussion over üòÇ
[6/26/17, 12:43:31 PM] Miller: "Yet the study will not put an end to the dispute"
[6/26/17, 12:43:57 PM] Launchpad: hmmm...good point
[6/26/17, 12:43:58 PM] Launchpad: the discussion will rage on
[6/26/17, 12:44:15 PM] Launchpad: mostly cause we (mostly) work in offices and get bored
[6/26/17, 12:46:31 PM] Justin: or the whole it jobs over 19$ hr raised dramatically
[6/26/17, 12:46:49 PM] Justin: or how the study excluded large firms, not like they employ alot of peeople or anything
[6/26/17, 12:47:22 PM] Launchpad: The Amazon effect
[6/26/17, 12:48:24 PM] Justin: i mean the thing is they are saying low wage workers lost 125$ month, but at same time they are saying people making 19$ hr(not low wage anymore) dramitcally increased
[6/26/17, 12:48:59 PM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/26/17, 12:49:02 PM] Justin: so like the article says, if most low wage workers became higher wage workers, than yeh the bottom percentile is left with what we will call " the deplorables:
[6/26/17, 12:49:06 PM] Kiyoon: I'm pretty bored at work too
[6/26/17, 12:49:26 PM] Launchpad: what are those, Caribbean hot dogs?? Gross
[6/26/17, 12:49:48 PM] Justin: yeh why you creeping on those two people in the ocean
[6/26/17, 12:51:42 PM] Miller: is it overcast or is your camera bad?
[6/26/17, 12:55:56 PM] Kiyoon: It's a little overcast right now
[6/26/17, 12:56:01 PM] Kiyoon: But my camera is also terrible
[6/26/17, 12:56:28 PM] Miller: the irony of this coming from zappos live chat
Holly:Thank you for verifying! I'll go ahead and look into this for you right now. I have never been to New York, but I love to travel and find good local bookstores. If I'm ever in your area, do you have any you could recommend?
[6/26/17, 12:56:50 PM] Miller: dont worry i did not miss the opportunity
[6/26/17, 12:56:50 PM] Donk: tell her sabbaros
[6/26/17, 12:57:13 PM] Steve: Also your ankle looks healthy @16313981203
[6/26/17, 12:57:24 PM] Steve: You flaunting it in @15166335046 face like that
[6/26/17, 12:57:31 PM] Steve: He doesn't take kindly to those things
[6/26/17, 12:57:55 PM] Donk: haha, i was trying to figure out which was fucked up from the photo and couldnt tell lol
[6/26/17, 12:59:25 PM] Launchpad: its an old camera trick

[6/26/17, 2:20:31 PM] Launchpad: To be fair that guy is/was an actual comedian
[6/26/17, 2:20:43 PM] Miller: im also pretty shocked he is borerline #woke
[6/26/17, 2:21:29 PM] Miller: one thing i am not shocked about is the üé© in his profile picture
[6/26/17, 2:26:04 PM] Justin: wouldnt really say he got roasted
[6/26/17, 2:26:52 PM] Justin: i mean to the how---i'd just say see above...to the shaving i'd say, look at my beard

[6/26/17, 3:08:13 PM] Dan Watts: Shouldn't ever take 2 weeks to draft a complaint
[6/26/17, 3:09:18 PM] Launchpad: should probably figure out how much a service costs BEFORE using it
[6/26/17, 3:09:31 PM] Dan Watts: He should sue that guy, most summons and complaints are boiler plate. Can get it out in a day. Even billing @$300/he that's at most 3k
[6/26/17, 3:10:01 PM] Miller: not only that but sue him and then when he wins get him to pay his lawyer fees
[6/26/17, 3:10:04 PM] Miller: .......of 30k
[6/26/17, 3:11:22 PM] Dan Watts: Usually lawyers do a retainer which generally represents at least half of the projected fee
[6/26/17, 3:14:33 PM] Steve: Or in cheeses case, 3 beers
[6/26/17, 3:15:17 PM] Scott: Boom.
[6/26/17, 3:15:27 PM] Scott: That's insane number
[6/26/17, 3:18:42 PM] Launchpad: 30,000 rupees?
[6/26/17, 3:19:18 PM] Launchpad: thats how much it would cost an indian guy to download a boilerplate template for you to use
[6/26/17, 3:20:28 PM] Miller: doubt it would cost an indian guy $456 to download a template
[6/26/17, 4:57:40 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/26/17, 4:57:41 PM] Miller: @16195657200
[6/26/17, 4:59:40 PM] Miller: http://www.reparations.me/
[6/26/17, 5:14:15 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/26/17, 5:16:35 PM] Justin: thats some next level shit : while attempting to fight system racism and cultural appropriation dumb white girl attempts to redefine the word reparations in only the way a dumb white girl can, thus pissing off everyone...
[6/26/17, 5:17:22 PM] Miller: seems like a perfect way for @16195657200 to assuage  some of his white guilt
[6/26/17, 5:18:28 PM] Launchpad: I can make requests right?
[6/26/17, 5:18:38 PM] Miller: you cannot
[6/26/17, 5:18:51 PM] Launchpad: thats racist....how do you know it was started by a white girl?
[6/26/17, 5:20:41 PM] Justin: well i assumed the pic of the 1st admin was said girl, it isnt.
[6/26/17, 5:20:46 PM] Launchpad: Its cool though that we can come up with all these new trendy terms for panhandling: 'social experiment', 'conceptual art'
[6/26/17, 5:21:18 PM] Dan Watts: lmao
[6/26/17, 5:22:10 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[6/26/17, 5:22:34 PM] Justin: i mean not exactly, insert dumb black woman
[6/26/17, 5:23:07 PM] Justin: and is crowdfunding panhandling as well?
[6/26/17, 5:24:02 PM] Justin: just curious if its only consdiering pathetic if you privde a childs request for food as opposed to being normal to fund some idiots project to gather the most bukaki scenes in a ten minute clip
[6/26/17, 5:24:49 PM] Miller: basically, yea
[6/26/17, 5:25:32 PM] Launchpad: lol
[6/26/17, 5:25:44 PM] Dan Watts: good question, i think theres a distinction in making donations based on something a person deems desirable rather than purely on race
[6/26/17, 5:26:13 PM] Miller: well i think its different
[6/26/17, 5:26:19 PM] Miller: in my mind theres 3 types of crowdfunding
[6/26/17, 5:27:01 PM] Steve: Who is making donations based on race?
[6/26/17, 5:27:25 PM] Steve: You all realize miller literally finds the stupidest things on the internet and out then here to see you idiots argue
[6/26/17, 5:27:28 PM] Dan Watts: the sole criteria of being a recipient on the reparations.me site is race
[6/26/17, 5:27:39 PM] Miller: 1. kickstarter type ventures where people are funding with the expressed purpose of receiving an item of value
2. donation type crowdfunding where people donate $ like you would to a charity but instead its to a personal cause or 
3. personal type kickstarters where poeple just raise money for non-medical/serious issues, like someone raising money for a boob job or a (cough) honeymoon
[6/26/17, 5:27:41 PM] Steve: It's basically his job, since none of us actually knows what he does
[6/26/17, 5:27:42 PM] Justin: I mean i agree that this should be an economics based project, not a race based project.  But I mean it's not like it excludes someone form making a similar project for poor people.  Also categorizing it as panhandling has nothing to do with race
[6/26/17, 5:28:22 PM] Dan Watts: i would support that
[6/26/17, 5:28:47 PM] Justin: boom we all agree miller loses
[6/26/17, 5:29:14 PM] Justin: still think its a dumb name if you are adamant about ignoring actual reparations...but a name is just a name
[6/26/17, 5:29:32 PM] Steve: Miller has already won since you all are still discussing that stupid Facebook
[6/26/17, 5:29:38 PM] Steve: Group

[6/26/17, 5:33:57 PM] Launchpad: did it alert them that we took screenshots like shapchat?
[6/26/17, 5:34:22 PM] Launchpad: User @15166335046 has taken a screenshot and posted it in group chat
[6/26/17, 5:37:09 PM] Launchpad: In all seriousness though, even though I'm a prick, if anyone wants to help a friend, hes almost at his goal https://www.gofundme.com/uniteforjoel?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_content=campaign_title&utm_campaign=donation_receiptv5
[6/26/17, 5:41:36 PM] Justin: I mean why didnt he get a better job to apy for his helath insurance?
[6/26/17, 5:42:42 PM] Steve: Yea, he should just work harder
[6/26/17, 5:43:10 PM] Steve: Maybe just get a better job
[6/26/17, 5:43:40 PM] Steve: Or better yet, talk you into mentoring him on how to do that
[6/26/17, 5:43:42 PM] Justin: or maybe try actual science instead of witchcraft
[6/26/17, 5:44:51 PM] Justin: LP giving up 100$-----dont let him bitch out on bottle service
[6/26/17, 5:45:36 PM] Miller: Seriously I assumed he was at least raising money for surgery not acupuncture massages and healthy food
[6/26/17, 5:45:54 PM] Miller: Also walking around is free
[6/26/17, 5:46:11 PM] Launchpad: thats actually relatively cheap compared to ER hospital room stay
[6/26/17, 5:46:36 PM] Brian Katz: Can I ask for reparations?
[6/26/17, 5:47:19 PM] Steve: You can ask for whatever you want
[6/26/17, 5:48:00 PM] Miller: I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!!!
[6/26/17, 5:49:26 PM] Launchpad: We we playing chat monopoly or something?
[6/26/17, 5:49:38 PM] Justin: my honest take he's applying a result oriented approach to his treatment, not always a good thing.  If diet was the right approach, how come the disease has become so severe he's now faced with surgery?  Literally is proof of you can't "read" your body.  With that siad i do listen to alternative healers like gary knowles
[6/26/17, 5:50:02 PM] Justin: so im on the fence as to weather he destroyed his body by not getting actual treatement
[6/26/17, 5:50:48 PM] Justin: i'd love to think big pharma is the big bad guy and diet = cure all...but its pretty unlikely
[6/26/17, 5:50:54 PM] Brian Katz: Cool, I want someone to pay for the Conner vs Floyd fight for me. I've already spent hundreds of dollars watching Floyd duck hug and jab people. It's time for me to see something in return for my suffering.
[6/26/17, 5:51:18 PM] Justin: just bet 3k on mayweather

[6/26/17, 5:54:14 PM] Brian Katz: Herman as a gambler you know that's a terrible bet
[6/26/17, 5:54:26 PM] Launchpad: Not just advice, but advice based on inaccurate assumptions
[6/26/17, 5:55:25 PM] Justin: i know exactly where he is coming from, i listen to people with phd's talking form the same angle
[6/26/17, 5:58:39 PM] Justin: ala how diet caused this "Unaddressed stressed led to a flare in January. Eventually I started Oral prednisone, which helped temporarily.  Symptoms increased including debilitating pain, bloating, dysbiosis and inflammation.  Some thought it was a slipped rib, but X-Ray showed otherwise.

Colonoscopy in June showed worst colon GI has ever seen, extremely high risk of perforation."
[6/26/17, 6:00:31 PM] Justin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjpmmgN5bpw
[6/26/17, 6:05:59 PM] Launchpad: are you suggesting a healthy diet caused that?
[6/26/17, 6:06:33 PM] Justin: not at all what im suggesting...i usggesting that a healthy diet didnt fix the problem
[6/26/17, 6:07:02 PM] Justin: may have given a perception of quality of life through partly a placebo effect, but the underlying disease is still there
[6/26/17, 6:08:00 PM] Justin: once again i listen to alternative medical experts that are shunned by medical community and they sell a nice story about how diet can fix everything.....i'd love to believe that, but its not likely true
[6/26/17, 6:14:12 PM] Launchpad: Or perhaps, even though the underlying disease is still there, it alleviates symptoms and actually improves the quality of life.
[6/26/17, 6:15:30 PM] Launchpad: Its not a placebo effect to notice that your body feels good after eating good foods and it feels shitty after eating shitty foods
[6/26/17, 6:17:32 PM] Donk: We finally get to see who wins the hibachi spoils tonight

[6/27/17, 7:24:48 AM] Steve: Lol
[6/27/17, 7:24:54 AM] Steve: That's the point of he chart
[6/27/17, 7:25:50 AM] Miller: Without Jeremy Lin the nets would have had the worst offense in the league
[6/27/17, 7:26:02 AM] Miller: Without Dwight Howard the hawks would have had the worst offense in the league
[6/27/17, 7:26:06 AM] Steve: He nets didn't have Jeremy Lin for most of the season
[6/27/17, 7:26:17 AM] Miller: Does that actually mean anything?
[6/27/17, 7:26:20 AM] Miller: No
[6/27/17, 7:26:21 AM] Steve: The Dwight Howard comment is clearly a lie
[6/27/17, 7:26:25 AM] Steve: #fakenews
[6/27/17, 7:26:35 AM] Steve: What does MVP mean?
[6/27/17, 7:27:08 AM] Steve: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[6/27/17, 7:27:53 AM] Miller: Hence stupid chart
[6/27/17, 7:27:55 AM] Miller: Without Durant gsw still had one of the best offenses in the league, conclusion? Durant sucks lol
[6/27/17, 7:28:23 AM] Steve: @16318489683 I think you should get off the no drinking for a night and have a bottle or two on @15166335046
[6/27/17, 7:29:48 AM] Miller: Forgetting that amazingly stupid chart onto the actual point I would love for you to actually tell me what my position on this was
[6/27/17, 7:30:54 AM] Steve: You're position was: harden for MVP.
[6/27/17, 7:31:11 AM] Steve: Thought that was self explanatory
[6/27/17, 7:34:00 AM] Steve: And it wasn't your point I'm bringing up. It's the one that I brought up, with others, time and time again. Of the three MVP finalists, who's team would be worse off without that respective player? And that would be the thunder by a long shot. In fact, the other two teams would be playoff teams in all likelihood. That holds, and rightfully so, a lot of clout in MVP talks.
[6/27/17, 7:34:25 AM] Steve: No I understand your wrong logic of "we'll if this guy wasn't on that team they would be worse"
[6/27/17, 7:34:32 AM] Steve: But those guys weren't MVP finalists
[6/27/17, 7:35:48 AM] Steve: And that's without factoring he stats, which were "clearly padded"
[6/27/17, 7:35:56 AM] Miller: The only reason that logic works is because the thunder were only middle of the pack even with him
[6/27/17, 7:37:25 AM] Steve: Which is where the spurs and Houston would have been with out Leonard and harden respectively.
[6/27/17, 7:41:24 AM] Miller: so the STEVE MVP voting system has to have a great player on an average team,, a great player on a great team (LBJ, durant, harden, leonard) would still be good teams w/o him and a great player on a bad team would still be a bad team w/o him
[6/27/17, 7:41:39 AM] Steve: No it doesn't have to
[6/27/17, 7:41:43 AM] Steve: It's this years race
[6/27/17, 7:42:05 AM] Steve: That was my opinion, among other factors we've talked about, on why he should have been MVP.
[6/27/17, 7:42:13 AM] Steve: Clearly he won, so others agreed.
[6/27/17, 7:42:21 AM] Steve: Still doesn't mean I'm right
[6/27/17, 7:42:26 AM] Steve: But he is the MVP
[6/27/17, 7:43:18 AM] Steve: I believe an MVP should elevate his team to a different level. And a player who brings his team from probably a lottery team to the playoffs has done that.
[6/27/17, 7:43:37 AM] Steve: A player that brings his team from a playoff team to a second round 4-1 loss isn't that impressive.
[6/27/17, 7:43:48 AM] Steve: And isn't that MVP like.
[6/27/17, 7:44:03 AM] Steve: Now, I get it, voting ends before playoffs.
[6/27/17, 7:44:21 AM] Steve: But we get the luxury to see the playoffs.
[6/27/17, 7:45:04 AM] Miller: ill put a pin in this, yes clearly he won the MVP, no im not surprised and i cant say he didnt deserve it
My position from the beginning has always been i dont know enough about the NBA and i am not arrogant enough to think i ever at any point this season knew more than prof sr nba analysts/writers or vegas and so if they are saying its close and you can make a case for harden, then yes i will take their word for it.  So i took more umbrage with the "not close" arrogance of you and katz's argument from guys who watched 4 combined thunder games this year, if that.
And finally the westbrook should automatically win the MVP b/c he made 2 digit things in 3 things argument was/is ridiculous.
[6/27/17, 7:45:17 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/27/17, 7:48:44 AM] Steve: Use that for that hibachi!
[6/27/17, 7:49:54 AM] Miller: oh i will
[6/27/17, 7:50:17 AM] Miller: any at any point in the future anyone ever wants to give me an even odds bet on a +120 or better odds im happy to take that and earn the spread, just a PSA
[6/27/17, 7:50:36 AM] Steve: Also, the stats weren't my only points. Clearly.
[6/27/17, 7:50:36 AM] Steve: I just think the stats, in my mind, put him over the top.
[6/27/17, 7:50:36 AM] Steve: And I never disagreed it wouldn't be close. I just thought, IMO, it shouldn't be.
[6/27/17, 7:50:36 AM] Steve: Also, you shouldn't assume you know what people watch and don't watch.
[6/27/17, 7:50:36 AM] Steve: You are at most with me once or twice a week.
[6/27/17, 8:08:21 AM] Donk: Are you kidding me? You thought he was so overwhelmingly the mvp that you said you wouldnt watch basketball anymore if he didnt win lol
[6/27/17, 8:08:36 AM] Steve: But I never said the vote wouldn't be close
[6/27/17, 8:08:43 AM] Steve: I just thought it shouldn't be
[6/27/17, 8:08:52 AM] Steve: You gotta be better at reason @donk
[6/27/17, 8:09:05 AM] Donk: Oh my bad, misread that
[6/27/17, 8:09:18 AM] Donk: Turns out that the vote wasnt really close anyway
[6/27/17, 8:13:34 AM] Steve: *reading
[6/27/17, 8:13:34 AM] Steve: I even said this exact statement time and time again: I think it will be close, but it shouldn't be.
[6/27/17, 8:13:34 AM] Steve: But the not watching basketball if he doesn't win was 1000% true
[6/27/17, 8:13:35 AM] Steve: Because of my strong opinion of it shouldn't be close
[6/27/17, 8:13:53 AM] Steve: Well I was wrong about that lol
[6/27/17, 8:35:34 AM] Steve: On a work note, my coworker andrea that came to by birthday dinner was fired yesterday because of a "budget decrease" even though she makes $20 less per day than I do and we do the same job.
[6/27/17, 8:35:45 AM] Steve: We are now a video team of 2 people.
[6/27/17, 8:36:08 AM] Miller: that blows, she was mad cool
[6/27/17, 8:36:16 AM] Steve: And good at what she does
[6/27/17, 8:36:23 AM] Steve: Basically, it was personal.
[6/27/17, 8:36:31 AM] Miller: at least she can now pursue her dream of professional quiddictch full time?
[6/27/17, 8:36:40 AM] Steve: Too soon lol
[6/27/17, 8:37:27 AM] Brian Katz: Gosh, a lot of salty harden supporters. Are you guys shocked today? I know I'm not. Your point that steve ad I only watched 4 thunder games combined is irrelevant, because I've been following basketball for 30 years, and no one has ever come close to averaging a triple double since I've been watching. @13478047760 enjoy your hibachi my friend. It was well earned after having so many pointless arguments with guys who read at most like three or four articles about the MVP playoff race.
[6/27/17, 8:58:07 AM] Donk: this michael floyd story about him failing alcohol tests while on probabtion and then blaming it on kombucha is pretty hilarious
[6/27/17, 8:58:26 AM] Donk: and the team backed him on it too, saying they have it on tap
[6/27/17, 8:59:07 AM] Miller: Lordy, I hope there are tapes
[6/27/17, 8:59:59 AM] Donk: my brother-in-law's friend makes kombucha, and is obsessed with it
[6/27/17, 9:00:19 AM] Donk: at his bachelor party, the dude brought a cooler with 8 growlers of kombucha with him so that he would have plenty to drink all weekend
[6/27/17, 9:00:55 AM] Donk: i thought it was a bit excessive, but hey, to each their own
[6/27/17, 9:01:24 AM] Miller: much like avocado, ive never had it
[6/27/17, 9:02:38 AM] Donk: its ok, the one i had kinda tasted like a mix of a strong herbal tea and ginger beer without the carbonation
[6/27/17, 9:03:45 AM] Dan Watts: Tastes like carbonated vinegar to me
[6/27/17, 9:05:24 AM] Scott: Crap
[6/27/17, 9:05:30 AM] Scott: But healthy
[6/27/17, 9:06:35 AM] Steve: #cheesehottaek
[6/27/17, 9:11:08 AM] Miller: Ahman Green Arrested On Child Abuse Charges
[6/27/17, 9:11:13 AM] Miller: i bet he will be blackballed for this
[6/27/17, 9:12:24 AM] Steve: Who?
[6/27/17, 9:13:01 AM] Donk: thats a throwback name for sure
[6/27/17, 9:13:09 AM] Miller: packed RB
[6/27/17, 9:13:26 AM] Miller: if he doesnt ever play again the only logical conclusion will be that decision was made b/c of these child abuse charges
[6/27/17, 9:16:33 AM] Miller: https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170626/midtown/johnny-utahs-mechanical-bull-injury-lawsuit?_ga=2.45036708.1490133266.1498568956-808903840.1430483671 damn i should have sued that place in new orleans
[6/27/17, 9:18:53 AM] Steve: Right
[6/27/17, 9:19:13 AM] Steve: I still find it mind bottling that you think Ahmad greens situation is the same at kaeps
[6/27/17, 9:19:24 AM] Steve: Like we have many similar views on social injustices
[6/27/17, 9:19:34 AM] Steve: But this is pretty clear
[6/27/17, 9:19:47 AM] Steve: Or anyone else's is the same
[6/27/17, 9:22:20 AM] Steve: I get that 98% of the time teams don't want a guy who can't play anymore and has some baggage
[6/27/17, 9:22:42 AM] Steve: But super bowl champion NFL head coach Pete Carroll literally said kaepernick can play at a high level
[6/27/17, 9:22:51 AM] Steve: And then didn't sign him
[6/27/17, 9:23:48 AM] Steve: And with all do respect to @15166335046 and his knowledge on judging QB's. I'm going to side with Carroll and still believe teams don't want him solely because of the "baggage".
[6/27/17, 9:24:13 AM] Steve: Which is him standing up for injustice for minorities
[6/27/17, 9:24:31 AM] Steve: So you can keep putting up pointless cases of actual has beens that aren't relevant
[6/27/17, 9:26:48 AM] Steve: But kaepernick is at the very least a capable back up on this league
[6/27/17, 9:27:00 AM] Steve: As scouted by a super bowl champion current coach
[6/27/17, 9:30:08 AM] Steve: Carroll said of Kaepernick Friday. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a starter in this league.
[6/27/17, 9:30:18 AM] Steve: ^since you like transcripts
[6/27/17, 9:30:20 AM] Launchpad: Did Carroll also say Kap will sign a 1 year deal for 695k? Cause that's what Austin Davis will make
[6/27/17, 9:32:12 AM] Steve: None of us know even if the negotiations got to that point
[6/27/17, 9:33:02 AM] Steve: But we do know what Carrolls assessment of him as a player was
[6/27/17, 9:33:30 AM] Steve: And that's @15166335046 entire point
[6/27/17, 9:41:20 AM] Miller: so just to be clear pete carroll thinks kapernick can still play at a high level, ????, seahawks sign austin davis
[6/27/17, 9:45:15 AM] Steve: Hence, black balled
[6/27/17, 9:45:45 AM] Miller: seattle the most progressive team in the country just hates winning that much
[6/27/17, 9:45:46 AM] Miller: crazy
[6/27/17, 9:46:06 AM] Miller: the same team that had multiple players kneeling during the anthem this year and didnt care
[6/27/17, 9:47:51 AM] Scott: Like mahmoud abdul rauf
[6/27/17, 9:48:09 AM] Donk: come on miller, its clearly because of kapernicks off the field stuff, and you know this
[6/27/17, 9:48:14 AM] Donk: he is better than a lot of backups
[6/27/17, 9:48:25 AM] Donk: but hes not signed because "hes a distraction"
[6/27/17, 9:48:43 AM] Donk: so its not just about whether or not he can play, but in fact about the "distraction"
[6/27/17, 9:51:00 AM] Donk: now, do i think if he was at brady or rodgers level that he would be signed right now regardless of the distraction? of course i do
[6/27/17, 9:51:27 AM] Donk: but because he would only be a high level back up, teams dont think its worth the risk/reward of signing him
[6/27/17, 9:53:15 AM] Miller: theres also a difference b/w signing a "starting QB" to be a backup and signing a "backup QB"
[6/27/17, 9:53:43 AM] Donk: i dont disagree with that
[6/27/17, 9:53:56 AM] Donk: but to say that his political stance has nothing to do with him being unsigned is ridiculous
[6/27/17, 9:54:03 AM] Miller: i never said that
[6/27/17, 9:54:19 AM] Miller: all i said was it is no different than APs hitting his children stance
[6/27/17, 9:54:34 AM] Miller: and the second AP isnt talented enough to justify the headache he too will be gone
[6/27/17, 9:54:41 AM] Miller: and you can say its b/c of that or not who cares
[6/27/17, 9:54:56 AM] Miller: will he still at that point be more talented then most 3rd string RBs? yes
[6/27/17, 9:54:57 AM] Donk: the second any player isnt talented enough they will be gone, its the nfl
[6/27/17, 9:55:15 AM] Miller: yes but the leash is shorter w/any off field "issues"
[6/27/17, 9:55:46 AM] Steve: Oh you have implied that
[6/27/17, 9:55:51 AM] Steve: On several occasions
[6/27/17, 9:55:59 AM] Steve: By simply posting things like this
[6/27/17, 9:56:14 AM] Miller: please dont put words in my mouth
[6/27/17, 9:56:37 AM] Miller: i have said his political stance plays a part on multiple occasions and it would be silly to think it doesnt
[6/27/17, 9:56:44 AM] Steve: ^
[6/27/17, 9:56:52 AM] Steve: It's the main factor
[6/27/17, 9:56:59 AM] Miller: the difference is i dont think it is THE reason he isnt signed
[6/27/17, 9:57:03 AM] Steve: And for you to continue to fight against that is mind bottling
[6/27/17, 9:57:10 AM] Steve: It is THE reason
[6/27/17, 9:57:19 AM] Donk: its is def the reason in this case
[6/27/17, 9:57:19 AM] Steve: Period
[6/27/17, 9:57:21 AM] Miller: you say that like its a fact
[6/27/17, 9:57:24 AM] Donk: it is a fact
[6/27/17, 9:57:24 AM] Miller: and you have no basis for that
[6/27/17, 9:57:24 AM] Steve: It is
[6/27/17, 9:57:26 AM] Miller: he isnt good
[6/27/17, 9:57:28 AM] Miller: that is a fact
[6/27/17, 9:57:30 AM] Miller: he isnt signed
[6/27/17, 9:57:30 AM] Steve: In fact many people say it
[6/27/17, 9:57:33 AM] Steve: Even your owner
[6/27/17, 9:57:33 AM] Miller: that is also a fact
[6/27/17, 9:57:36 AM] Donk: hes better than austin davis
[6/27/17, 9:57:42 AM] Steve: You know, the giants owner
[6/27/17, 9:57:47 AM] Miller: so is jay cutler not better than austin davis?
[6/27/17, 9:57:52 AM] Donk: he is better than whoever the jets have, or san fransico or a couple of other teams
[6/27/17, 9:57:53 AM] Miller: is RG3 not better?
[6/27/17, 9:58:04 AM] Donk: jay cutler didnt work out for seattle
[6/27/17, 9:58:11 AM] Donk: so that doesnt work
[6/27/17, 9:58:17 AM] Donk: he also turned down a deal from the jets
[6/27/17, 9:58:17 AM] Miller: wow didnt even get a phone call?
[6/27/17, 9:58:21 AM] Miller: sounds like he was blackballed
[6/27/17, 9:58:47 AM] Steve: But none of those guys did what kaepernick did
[6/27/17, 9:58:52 AM] Steve: You are missing the entire point
[6/27/17, 9:58:58 AM] Steve: Those guys are actually not good anymore
[6/27/17, 9:59:00 AM] Miller: ive posted literally tons of unbiased 3rd party information showing kapernick has not been a good QB for years
[6/27/17, 9:59:02 AM] Miller: you guys ignore it
[6/27/17, 9:59:07 AM] Steve: Kaep is being blackballed for what he did
[6/27/17, 9:59:22 AM] Donk: im not saying that kapernick is tom brady, i dont think anyone has said that
[6/27/17, 9:59:31 AM] Steve: Oh I read that and saw that and think that it's overblown
[6/27/17, 9:59:33 AM] Donk: however, he is better than most teams backups and a fair number of starters
[6/27/17, 9:59:43 AM] Steve: Agreed @19732079889
[6/27/17, 9:59:56 AM] Launchpad: It is not a 'fact' - it is a factor
[6/27/17, 9:59:58 AM] Launchpad: one of many
[6/27/17, 9:59:59 AM] Steve: It's literally the first time we've unanimously agreed on anything
[6/27/17, 10:00:07 AM] Miller: "overblown" as in pro football focus who has made an entire business out of nfl evaluations is wrong but steve is right
[6/27/17, 10:00:22 AM] Miller: yea ill trust their QB evaluations
[6/27/17, 10:00:23 AM] Steve: I'm going by a guy who coaches and won a super bowl
[6/27/17, 10:00:29 AM] Steve: And an owner who has won 3
[6/27/17, 10:00:31 AM] Miller: a guy who refused to sign him
[6/27/17, 10:00:33 AM] Steve: I think they hold more clit
[6/27/17, 10:00:37 AM] Steve: Don't you?
[6/27/17, 10:00:37 AM] Miller: really put his money where his mouth is therer
[6/27/17, 10:00:45 AM] Steve: Or maybe you should ask guys behind a computer
[6/27/17, 10:01:07 AM] Miller: stats only matter sometimes, best to trust a random QB/executive
[6/27/17, 10:01:24 AM] Steve: Actually a coach
[6/27/17, 10:01:24 AM] Launchpad: was that a clit joke? nicely done
[6/27/17, 10:01:44 AM] Miller: steve carrols publicly fawns over FA QB
[6/27/17, 10:01:48 AM] Miller: still decides to sign bum instead
[6/27/17, 10:01:50 AM] Steve: Not a "random QB"
[6/27/17, 10:01:54 AM] Miller: gee no saving face there
[6/27/17, 10:02:11 AM] Steve: Because he doesn't want to deal with kaeps "off the field issues"
[6/27/17, 10:02:15 AM] Steve: Clearly
[6/27/17, 10:02:19 AM] Miller: of course
[6/27/17, 10:02:25 AM] Miller: b/c he isnt good enough to put up with it
[6/27/17, 10:02:31 AM] Miller: unlike say michael bennett
[6/27/17, 10:02:32 AM] Steve: Right
[6/27/17, 10:02:34 AM] Steve: Whatever
[6/27/17, 10:02:37 AM] Steve: Be naive
[6/27/17, 10:02:37 AM] Miller: wonder why SEA hasnt cut him yet
[6/27/17, 10:02:41 AM] Steve: Don't care anymore
[6/27/17, 10:03:06 AM] Steve: He sucks, that's THE reason
[6/27/17, 10:03:22 AM] Miller: literally the ENTIRE premise of your argument is that he is good, which it has been proven by people who do this for a living, he is not
[6/27/17, 10:03:31 AM] Miller: b/c if he isnt good your entire argument falls apart
[6/27/17, 10:06:17 AM] Steve: Actually it's been proven otherwise
[6/27/17, 10:06:26 AM] Steve: By people who actually do football for a living
[6/27/17, 10:06:39 AM] Steve: Not people who sit behind a computer for a living
[6/27/17, 10:07:14 AM] Donk: pretty sure the people at pro football focus do football for a living
[6/27/17, 10:07:18 AM] Miller: def should take everything coaches say publicly as #FAX and ignore all logical and objective statistical based analysis
[6/27/17, 10:07:21 AM] Donk: while also behind a computer
[6/27/17, 10:07:38 AM] Donk: but the point here is that yes, you ahve proven that kapernick isnt brady
[6/27/17, 10:07:39 AM] Donk: we know this
[6/27/17, 10:07:46 AM] Launchpad: there is a thing in the NFL called a salary Kap
[6/27/17, 10:07:54 AM] Launchpad: it was appropriated from black QBs
[6/27/17, 10:08:06 AM] Donk: but you have shown nothing that shows he would be a better than most backup qbs or some starters
[6/27/17, 10:08:11 AM] Miller: not brady is one thing
[6/27/17, 10:08:33 AM] Donk: ok, so right there are three qbs hes better then, plus all of the back ups
[6/27/17, 10:08:47 AM] Donk: there are somewhere between 64 and 96 qb jobs in the nfl
[6/27/17, 10:09:00 AM] Miller: technically all those backups arent in this list b/c they didnt "start"
[6/27/17, 10:09:01 AM] Donk: so he is number 30 give or take?
[6/27/17, 10:09:11 AM] Miller: but dont keep saying he is "not brady" implying he is not amazing but still good
[6/27/17, 10:09:14 AM] Donk: ill even given you 10 more and say he is number 40
[6/27/17, 10:09:31 AM] Donk: so therefore just about any team would be in great shape to have him as a back up
[6/27/17, 10:09:33 AM] Miller: he was about as bad a starting QB as there was last yr
[6/27/17, 10:09:37 AM] Donk: and yet he is unsigned?
[6/27/17, 10:09:52 AM] Miller: and so is RG3
[6/27/17, 10:09:53 AM] Miller: and cutler
[6/27/17, 10:10:00 AM] Donk: culter turned down a deal
[6/27/17, 10:10:02 AM] Donk: so that doesnt count
[6/27/17, 10:10:03 AM] Miller: im sure they too are better than backup QBs
[6/27/17, 10:10:40 AM] Miller: on talent alone is he good enough to be a backup QB somewhere? absolutely
[6/27/17, 10:10:56 AM] Miller: but there are a number of factors that go into teams looking at backup QBs
[6/27/17, 10:11:33 AM] Donk: so therefore, him being a "distraction" because he wants to protest the treatment of black people in this country is the reason he is unsigned
[6/27/17, 10:11:35 AM] Donk: and not his talent level
[6/27/17, 10:11:39 AM] Miller: a lot of teams look for veterans, a lot of teams look for guys with similar styles (aka not mobile or mobile depending on the starter), salary demands are very different, and yes off the field issues are much more important b/c why would a team put up with any kind of off the field headache for a guy they hope will never play
[6/27/17, 10:11:56 AM] Miller: no, like i said a million times, its both
[6/27/17, 10:12:05 AM] Miller: b/c if his talent level was better the other stuff would not matter
[6/27/17, 10:12:23 AM] Miller: just like it was with greg hardy or AP
[6/27/17, 10:12:26 AM] Miller: and it was not with ray rice
[6/27/17, 10:13:17 AM] Donk: i love how you keep roping him into the same level as two women beaters and a child beater
[6/27/17, 10:13:51 AM] Miller: IM not doing that on a personal level
[6/27/17, 10:14:00 AM] Miller: but i believe the NFL does
[6/27/17, 10:14:07 AM] Donk: i know, realized after i sent it that i was accidently implying that
[6/27/17, 10:14:18 AM] Miller: i think they lump everything (dog fighting, woman beating, child beating, political shit) whatever into "off the field"
[6/27/17, 10:14:26 AM] Miller: tebow/religous put in there also
[6/27/17, 10:14:41 AM] Miller: it plays a factor in the decision making, of course
[6/27/17, 10:14:53 AM] Donk: tebow had way more chances than kapernick ever did imo
[6/27/17, 10:15:03 AM] Donk: including his current sideshow in baseball
[6/27/17, 10:15:22 AM] Miller: yea unsurprisingly being religous christian is easier to swallow than being pro-black
[6/27/17, 10:15:47 AM] Donk: tebow at least got a chance to play qb, where as 10 years eariler, eric crouch didnt get that same oppurtunity even though he was basically the same player
[6/27/17, 10:21:02 AM] Donk: but in the end here, and you think you would agree, that kapernick without a doubt has the talent to be in the nfl
[6/27/17, 10:21:19 AM] Donk: and if had never done any of the things he did regarding the anthem, that he would be signed to a team right now
[6/27/17, 10:21:29 AM] Donk: but because of the "distraction" he brings, he remains unsigned
[6/27/17, 10:22:10 AM] Donk: so therefore, the only reasonable conclusion is that he is unsigned because of the distraction
[6/27/17, 10:24:16 AM] Miller: its either or, if he had no off the field issues he would probably be signed, or if he was more talented and still had the off the field issues he would also be signed
[6/27/17, 10:24:27 AM] Miller: so yes i think we are saying essentially the same thing
[6/27/17, 10:28:27 AM] Steve: Nope
[6/27/17, 10:28:37 AM] Steve: We are saying THE reason is off the filed
[6/27/17, 10:28:41 AM] Steve: *field
[6/27/17, 10:28:49 AM] Steve: You are saying both things are equally to blame
[6/27/17, 10:28:53 AM] Steve: Two different things
[6/27/17, 10:31:56 AM] Launchpad: the talent : headache ratio must be at a certain level
[6/27/17, 10:32:38 AM] Launchpad: THR must be over 2.5 to be signable
[6/27/17, 10:33:40 AM] Launchpad: if his talent were a little higher or the amount of headaches caused fewer, he would be signed
[6/27/17, 10:35:06 AM] Steve: I'll agree to disagree
[6/27/17, 11:17:07 AM] Brian Katz: If harambe was alive he'd be signed. Just saying

[6/27/17, 12:00:45 PM] Steve: That's disturbing
[6/27/17, 12:05:44 PM] Miller: first sentence of the article? "Resurfacing for the first time in months" üòÇ
[6/27/17, 12:06:08 PM] Miller: god forbid a friend congratulates someone on something
[6/27/17, 12:06:41 PM] Launchpad: but did she let him finish?
[6/27/17, 12:07:22 PM] Miller: well his speech was like 12 hours ago
[6/27/17, 12:07:23 PM] Miller: so yea
[6/27/17, 12:07:45 PM] Steve: She resurfaces to steal his thunder
[6/27/17, 12:07:52 PM] Steve: Such a tswizzle move
[6/27/17, 12:08:40 PM] Steve: Oh wait, my "friend" just won the most prestigious single honor a player can get? Let me say something now after being silent for months which would take away from it.
[6/27/17, 12:11:21 PM] Miller: its true, by now everyone has even forgotten westbrook won the MVP and i think ESPN is just going to lead with 40 minutes about taylors congratulations
[6/27/17, 12:11:31 PM] Steve: Also, let me make a video because I can't tweet a congratulations
[6/27/17, 12:11:40 PM] Steve: People should see her face, of course
[6/27/17, 12:11:57 PM] Steve: #typical
[6/27/17, 12:12:27 PM] Miller: never seen someone mansplain a congratulations before
[6/27/17, 12:13:05 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/27/17, 12:13:19 PM] Steve: You need to look up the definition of mansplaining
[6/27/17, 12:13:25 PM] Steve: Before using it incorrectly
[6/27/17, 12:14:01 PM] Steve: While you are there, you'll notice woke is now a Websters official.
[6/27/17, 12:15:17 PM] Miller: youre now mansplaining the definition of mansplaining?

[6/27/17, 12:17:01 PM] Miller: #staywoke

[6/27/17, 12:30:49 PM] Steve: I suggested stay woke was websters official

[6/27/17, 2:23:43 PM] Donk: so bad at others
[6/27/17, 2:23:57 PM] Donk: also, i cant get that one play out of my mind vs the giants
[6/27/17, 2:24:02 PM] Donk: it was either his 1st or 2nd year
[6/27/17, 2:24:16 PM] Donk: and kiwinuka had him wrapped up for a sack and thought he heard a whistle, but there wasnt one
[6/27/17, 2:24:18 PM] Donk: and let him go
[6/27/17, 2:24:38 PM] Donk: and young made that ridiculous play for a td
[6/27/17, 2:25:04 PM] Donk: that might have also been the game where either osi and kiwi picked up a fumble, ran it back like 30 yards, and then fumbled it back to them
[6/27/17, 2:25:22 PM] Donk: terrible loss for a game we should have won if not for boneheaded plays
[6/27/17, 2:33:25 PM] Miller: i remember that play distinctly as well

That is their response to raising minimum wage couple with their restaurants losing money because people on the whole are eating healthier.

[6/28/17, 7:01:55 AM] Steve: David griffin is at least a proven gm/front office guy
[6/28/17, 7:02:08 AM] Steve: So I trust that more at this point
[6/28/17, 7:02:14 AM] Brian Katz: The Knicks are proven too
[6/28/17, 7:02:28 AM] Brian Katz: As soulcrushers
[6/28/17, 7:05:42 AM] Steve: Ok negative Nancy
[6/28/17, 8:26:28 AM] Brian Katz: Okay, get your hopes up. I bet we're great going forward
[6/28/17, 8:27:35 AM] Steve: My hopes are realistic but I don't doom my teams forever like you
[6/28/17, 8:27:57 AM] Steve: I've lived through the same years you have
[6/28/17, 8:31:02 AM] Brian Katz: Well it's great that we just drafted a pg that can run the triangle, and then changed our "Phil"osophy
[6/28/17, 8:34:52 AM] Steve: We needed a PG either way
[6/28/17, 8:34:57 AM] Steve: So I don't mind the pick
[6/28/17, 8:43:44 AM] Brian Katz: But why have your gm draft, and then immediately fire him? The Knicks always do things the wrong way. That's why we sucked, we do suck, and we'll continue to suck.
[6/28/17, 8:44:18 AM] Steve: They fired him because of the melo buyout
[6/28/17, 8:44:30 AM] Steve: Which wasn't an issue until the last couple of days
[6/28/17, 8:44:50 AM] Steve: Dolan is not buying melo out and Phil hasn't been able to work out a trade
[6/28/17, 8:44:54 AM] Brian Katz: Great, we stay stinking. We should buy melo out
[6/28/17, 8:45:06 AM] Brian Katz: He sucks too
[6/28/17, 8:45:40 AM] Brian Katz: Three playoff appearances in 7 years with 5 h ad coaches. Go away melo
[6/28/17, 8:45:43 AM] Steve: The knicks didn't want to have he toxic environment
[6/28/17, 8:45:59 AM] Steve: I'm not disagreeing we should get rid of melo
[6/28/17, 8:46:06 AM] Brian Katz: We do, and will always have a toxic environment
[6/28/17, 8:46:08 AM] Steve: I was on the get rid of melo 3 years ago
[6/28/17, 8:46:18 AM] Steve: But having Phil and melo together is worse
[6/28/17, 8:46:37 AM] Steve: The issue is melo has a no trade clause
[6/28/17, 8:46:48 AM] Steve: And we have to work out a deal to where he wants to go
[6/28/17, 8:46:59 AM] Steve: The knicks will never pay melo to go win a chip somewhere else
[6/28/17, 8:47:04 AM] Steve: So forget about a buyout
[6/28/17, 8:47:07 AM] Steve: It's not happening
[6/28/17, 8:48:03 AM] Steve: They'd rather buyout phils 12m a year than melo
[6/28/17, 8:48:23 AM] Steve: Just to make the players happy
[6/28/17, 8:48:34 AM] Brian Katz: I don't care we suck, and it ain't getting better
[6/28/17, 8:50:56 AM] Steve: Clearly you don't care

[6/28/17, 10:26:12 AM] Miller: thats like saying being the GM of a burger king would stop someone from taking a job as the CEO of google
[6/28/17, 10:26:33 AM] Steve: That's a pretty bad analogy
[6/28/17, 10:26:36 AM] Steve: But I get it
[6/28/17, 10:26:53 AM] Miller: true at least burger king will likely still be around in 5 years
[6/28/17, 10:27:50 AM] Brian Katz: I hope the Knicks move or franchise closes
[6/28/17, 10:28:22 AM] Miller: i hope they move to ronkonkoma
[6/28/17, 10:28:54 AM] Donk: yeah i dont understand this thinking the knicks will be bad forever thing
[6/28/17, 10:28:59 AM] Donk: is it bad right now? yes, yes it is
[6/28/17, 10:29:05 AM] Donk: but they have won championships before
[6/28/17, 10:29:09 AM] Donk: they will again, its only a matter of time
[6/28/17, 10:29:14 AM] Donk: look at the cubs and red sox
[6/28/17, 10:29:38 AM] Steve: Or so many other teams that have longer droughts
[6/28/17, 10:29:44 AM] Steve: Like all Cleveland sports lol
[6/28/17, 10:29:48 AM] Donk: also, in dolans defense, the rangers have been pretty damn good
[6/28/17, 10:29:59 AM] Donk: certainly since the salary cap introduction
[6/28/17, 10:30:02 AM] Steve: And the liberty as well
[6/28/17, 10:30:12 AM] Donk: get out of here with that nonsense
[6/28/17, 10:38:56 AM] Steve: http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-broadcaster-ron-darling-rips-trainers-latest-injury-article-1.3283039
[6/28/17, 10:39:09 AM] Steve: About time someone said something
[6/28/17, 10:40:11 AM] Steve: But rangers have been good mainly because glen sather and Jeff gorton are very good executives
[6/28/17, 10:40:30 AM] Steve: Nothing to do with Dolan
[6/28/17, 10:41:04 AM] Miller: dolan was a disaster for years but he finally did the one thing everyone had been begging him to do, step away, stop making decisions and hire a real basketball guy to handle all of that
[6/28/17, 10:41:08 AM] Steve: And because their farm system produced talent that worked out
[6/28/17, 10:41:18 AM] Donk: yeah and now people are giving him shit for not being more involved
[6/28/17, 10:41:20 AM] Donk: you cant win
[6/28/17, 10:41:24 AM] Miller: needless to say it didnt work but he did what everyone wanted him to, and spent 80m to do so
[6/28/17, 10:41:34 AM] Steve: Oh I don't need him to be involved
[6/28/17, 10:41:45 AM] Steve: I need him to just recognize when it's not working and make a change
[6/28/17, 10:41:51 AM] Steve: Like an owner should
[6/28/17, 10:41:55 AM] Steve: Then step back again
[6/28/17, 10:42:41 AM] Miller: hes eating 24m, im not gonna tell a guy he should be eating 36m or 50m or w/e
[6/28/17, 10:42:45 AM] Miller: its kind of crazy
[6/28/17, 10:43:17 AM] Miller: hes probably spent > 100m just on dead $ on coaches/executives in the last decade
[6/28/17, 10:47:25 AM] Steve: Absolutely
[6/28/17, 10:55:15 AM] Launchpad: Why would you think I'm a Trump fan? Cause I said 'fuck ll the worlds problems lets go on vacation?'
[6/28/17, 11:03:47 AM] Launchpad: vacations with the family?? üíç
[6/28/17, 11:06:03 AM] Brian Katz: Kiyoon must be nervous, he's sweating through his shirt
[6/28/17, 11:06:26 AM] Launchpad: lmao
[6/28/17, 11:24:35 AM] Kiyoon: They live in St. Croix that's why we here
[6/28/17, 11:24:41 AM] Kiyoon: And it's cause it 101 degrees
[6/28/17, 11:26:27 AM] Justin: Haters gonna hate
[6/28/17, 11:30:29 AM] Brian Katz: It's a wet heat lol
[6/28/17, 11:34:35 AM] Steve: @16316620763 would suggest you block us
[6/28/17, 11:48:59 AM] Justin: https://blog.oup.com/2017/06/9-facts-about-hermeneutics/?utm_content=buffer89e9f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer
[6/28/17, 11:51:57 AM] Justin: You've all been fucking with the hermanutics, get on my level.
[6/28/17, 11:54:53 AM] Kiyoon: What do you mean by wet heat
[6/28/17, 11:55:04 AM] Kiyoon: Like humid or sweaty??
[6/28/17, 11:56:10 AM] Donk: wet heat like a hot shower
[6/28/17, 11:56:50 AM] Steve: @16313981203 you ask her dad for her hand in marriage yet?
[6/28/17, 11:57:02 AM] Steve: Seems like the perfect opportunity
[6/28/17, 11:57:11 AM] Kiyoon: It's pretty dry
[6/28/17, 11:57:17 AM] Kiyoon: And no I have not
[6/28/17, 11:57:49 AM] Brian Katz: It's a wet heat kiyoon, all around the brow and chest
[6/28/17, 11:59:15 AM] Steve: We should take bets on who gets married first - KY or cheese 2.0?
[6/28/17, 11:59:34 AM] Launchpad: add herman into that mix
[6/28/17, 11:59:49 AM] Donk: def cheese 2.0
[6/28/17, 12:01:32 PM] Miller: the real question is who gets divorced next?
[6/28/17, 12:01:35 PM] Miller: cheese 2.0 or the field?
[6/28/17, 12:03:15 PM] Donk: def cheese 2.02
[6/28/17, 12:03:18 PM] Donk: 2.0
[6/28/17, 12:04:43 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese
[6/28/17, 12:05:37 PM] Kiyoon: I'll put wild card Steve
[6/28/17, 12:06:42 PM] Steve: Of getting married or divorced?

[6/28/17, 12:08:17 PM] Donk: i had the birthday cake ones once
[6/28/17, 12:08:42 PM] Miller: its absolute insanity, go to a big grocery store, they literally have an entire aisle of oreos
[6/28/17, 12:08:58 PM] Miller: the originals are fine, none of the variations are better
[6/28/17, 12:09:07 PM] Donk: they must be selling this weird varieties since they keep making new ones
[6/28/17, 12:12:35 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/28/17, 12:12:38 PM] Miller: red velvet was decent
[6/28/17, 12:12:44 PM] Brian Katz: That's a lotta oreos
[6/28/17, 12:13:29 PM] Miller: me
[6/28/17, 12:18:58 PM] Launchpad: Katz you should really charge your phone
[6/28/17, 12:19:35 PM] Launchpad: thats insane how many oreos there are.  The birthday cake ones are awesome
[6/28/17, 12:19:52 PM] Launchpad: I've had peanut butter and red velvet and those are good too
[6/28/17, 12:23:49 PM] Miller: Chris Paul will be traded to the Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Lou Williams and a 2018 first-round pick
[6/28/17, 12:24:21 PM] Steve: That's a nice return for the clips
[6/28/17, 12:24:30 PM] Steve: Do they keep griffin now?
[6/28/17, 12:25:36 PM] Scott: And wait so harden is no longer the primary ball handler
[6/28/17, 12:25:45 PM] Scott: That could hurt them bad
[6/28/17, 12:25:51 PM] Scott: Paul has the ball in his hands alot
[6/28/17, 12:26:08 PM] Donk: wait, i thought paul was a free agent
[6/28/17, 12:26:16 PM] Donk: did he sign a max deal first and then got traded?
[6/28/17, 12:26:28 PM] Scott: #millermakebelieve
[6/28/17, 12:26:35 PM] Miller: he opted into his final year in a sign-trade
[6/28/17, 12:26:41 PM] Miller: told LAC he was signing w/HOU
[6/28/17, 12:26:42 PM] Donk: ah ok
[6/28/17, 12:26:46 PM] Miller: so they took what they could get
[6/28/17, 12:26:59 PM] Miller: yea adding chris paul is going to be terrible
[6/28/17, 12:27:08 PM] Steve: Lol
[6/28/17, 12:27:12 PM] Scott: It's gonna hurt harden
[6/28/17, 12:27:18 PM] Steve: Also clips got a good return
[6/28/17, 12:27:24 PM] Miller: hurt what? his fantasy value?
[6/28/17, 12:27:29 PM] Scott: He had his best year as primary ball handler
[6/28/17, 12:27:30 PM] Scott: Changes the offense
[6/28/17, 12:27:33 PM] Scott: I'm sure it'll work but u know what I mean
[6/28/17, 12:27:35 PM] Steve: It's ok, he's done as MVP runner up anyway
[6/28/17, 12:28:02 PM] Scott: And I'll pivot to fantasy value
[6/28/17, 12:28:39 PM] Donk: yeah i dont see how adding a top 5 pg makes the rockets worse
[6/28/17, 12:28:54 PM] Donk: and he plays great defense which offsets losing beverly
[6/28/17, 12:29:58 PM] Scott: Doesn't make them worse. Changes things alot
[6/28/17, 12:32:59 PM] Donk: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/28/17, 12:33:50 PM] Donk: the biggest surprise here imo is that paul opted into the last year of his deal vs signing a much larger than
[6/28/17, 12:34:01 PM] Donk: seems silly to leave 150-175 mil on the table imo
[6/28/17, 12:34:08 PM] Scott: Ur silly
[6/28/17, 12:34:36 PM] Donk: cheese 2.0, same cheese 1.0 jokes
[6/28/17, 12:35:30 PM] Steve: I don't think rockets can afford to add him on a max
[6/28/17, 12:35:37 PM] Steve: From what I read before the deal
[6/28/17, 12:35:40 PM] Steve: That's the issue
[6/28/17, 12:48:14 PM] Miller: lol miguel montero DFAd
[6/28/17, 12:48:18 PM] Miller: life comes at you fast
[6/28/17, 12:48:50 PM] Steve: Guy should not have thrown his pitchers under the bus
[6/28/17, 12:48:53 PM] Steve: So stupid
[6/28/17, 12:49:11 PM] Miller: yea seemed like that was definitely going to happen
[6/28/17, 12:49:21 PM] Steve: He is the 2nd worst catcher at throwing out baserunners in baseball
[6/28/17, 12:49:35 PM] Steve: So you mean to tell me it's every pitcher he ever catches is slow? Lol
[6/28/17, 12:49:35 PM] Miller: i mean miguel montero has the talent to be a backup catcher but once you have these off the field headaches, just not worth keeping him around
[6/28/17, 12:49:38 PM] Steve: Come on guy!
[6/28/17, 12:49:53 PM] Steve: It was actually on the field issues
[6/28/17, 12:50:06 PM] Steve: You didn't read what I wrote
[6/28/17, 12:50:12 PM] Miller: o really? so if he doesnt say shit after the game they cut him?
[6/28/17, 12:50:16 PM] Steve: And then again related it tonsimething it even close
[6/28/17, 12:50:22 PM] Steve: You are bad at these analogies today
[6/28/17, 12:50:31 PM] Steve: No, they don't
[6/28/17, 12:50:50 PM] Miller: sounds like a combination of his talent not being good enough to justify dealing with it
[6/28/17, 12:51:02 PM] Steve: Nope, seems like only one issue
[6/28/17, 12:51:04 PM] Miller: wonder what would have happened if rizzo had said arrieta sucks at holding guys on, they probably cut him too right?
[6/28/17, 12:51:10 PM] Steve: He bad mouthed his teammate
[6/28/17, 12:51:23 PM] Steve: And that's not the same as standing up for civil rights
[6/28/17, 12:51:28 PM] Steve: So keep making that analogy
[6/28/17, 12:51:58 PM] Steve: Which is wrong on every level
[6/28/17, 12:52:33 PM] Steve: It's actually crazy how you are trying to make a connection in every situation to the kaepernick thing
[6/28/17, 12:52:58 PM] Steve: And you couldn't be more wrong, off, naive, etc.
[6/28/17, 12:52:59 PM] Miller: and yet ahman green remains unsigned
[6/28/17, 12:53:06 PM] Steve: Exactly
[6/28/17, 12:53:25 PM] Steve: Keep living under your rock on this one
[6/28/17, 12:54:45 PM] Miller: my dream is the cowboys sign him and dak gets injured
[6/28/17, 12:54:57 PM] Steve: I wouldn't mind it one bit
[6/28/17, 12:55:10 PM] Steve: My dream is one day you wake up and realize you were wrong on it
[6/28/17, 12:55:42 PM] Steve: The signing part
[6/28/17, 12:55:49 PM] Steve: Don't want dark to get hurt, obvi
[6/28/17, 12:55:57 PM] Steve: *dak
[6/28/17, 12:56:48 PM] Launchpad: Theres also a difference between 'Standing up for your civil rights' and 'Standing up for your civil rights by sitting down and insulting something people consider sacred'
[6/28/17, 12:58:47 PM] Justin: figured id walk into your realm
[6/28/17, 12:58:53 PM] Justin: pff advanced statistics
[6/28/17, 12:59:05 PM] Justin: 100= average
[6/28/17, 12:59:28 PM] Justin: so overall hes above average
[6/28/17, 12:59:33 PM] Steve: So people should stand up to things while not offending people?
[6/28/17, 12:59:39 PM] Steve: Even if they feel an injustice?
[6/28/17, 12:59:44 PM] Miller: take it up with PFF @16316620763
[6/28/17, 12:59:47 PM] Miller: break the whole thing wide open
[6/28/17, 12:59:50 PM] Miller: PFF is fake news
[6/28/17, 1:00:41 PM] Justin: techinically this is pro football reference
[6/28/17, 1:00:48 PM] Miller: PFF is actually probably part of the whole blackballing conspiracy
[6/28/17, 1:00:52 PM] Justin: maybe they are like fox news to pff
[6/28/17, 1:00:52 PM] Miller: i think you are onto something
[6/28/17, 1:01:17 PM] Steve: We should worry about people's feelings when you feel you and/or your community as a whole are being disenfranchised and treated as second class citizens?
[6/28/17, 1:01:26 PM] Steve: Sounds like a snowflake take to me
[6/28/17, 1:01:53 PM] Justin: joe flacco also in same category as cap accoridng to those adjusted qbr ratings
[6/28/17, 1:02:01 PM] Justin: and he's 3rd highest paid qb in league?
[6/28/17, 1:02:03 PM] Steve: Sorry if he hurt your very fragile feelings scott. Maybe next time he gets pulled over because the color of his skin you can feel bad for him too.
[6/28/17, 1:02:10 PM] Steve: Oh wait, you don't give a fuck?
[6/28/17, 1:02:15 PM] Steve: True, true
[6/28/17, 1:02:40 PM] Justin: add in kaep was #1 ranked ruishing qb
[6/28/17, 1:03:43 PM] Steve: Or when another black man gets strangled to death for selling loosies you'll care...oh wait, you didn't? Shocking. But let's worry about kneeling or standing for a song. That's the important part of it all.
[6/28/17, 1:05:06 PM] Justin: In lp defense he never said it offended him
[6/28/17, 1:05:17 PM] Launchpad: You're the one butthurt hes not in the league, im just explaining why
[6/28/17, 1:05:22 PM] Steve: Or whoever it offends
[6/28/17, 1:05:36 PM] Justin: But I agree with you, snoeflake thing is kinda rediculous considering how butt hurt right constantly is over things like a song
[6/28/17, 1:05:42 PM] Steve: I meant that as more of a braod stroke
[6/28/17, 1:05:52 PM] Steve: Just specifically at LP because he said it
[6/28/17, 1:06:13 PM] Justin: Also means lp in agreement with you that his kneeling is why he's not in the league
[6/28/17, 1:06:31 PM] Justin: Miller only one left
[6/28/17, 1:07:03 PM] Justin: He needs to get on his hermeneutics
[6/28/17, 1:08:01 PM] Miller: its semantics, my position is/has always been he is not in the league b/c of the combination of his lack of talent and his off field issues
[6/28/17, 1:08:16 PM] Steve: He doesn't have off the field issues
[6/28/17, 1:08:21 PM] Miller: guy
[6/28/17, 1:08:21 PM] Steve: He has off the field stances
[6/28/17, 1:08:23 PM] Miller: for the last time
[6/28/17, 1:08:24 PM] Launchpad: I did not say there is exactly one reason why he is not in the league but I know you love living in a black and white world
[6/28/17, 1:08:25 PM] Steve: By difference
[6/28/17, 1:08:30 PM] Steve: *big
[6/28/17, 1:08:31 PM] Miller: this is not YOUR or MINE opinions
[6/28/17, 1:08:38 PM] Steve: Beating your wife
[6/28/17, 1:08:41 PM] Steve: Beating your kid
[6/28/17, 1:08:46 PM] Steve: Pulling a gun out
[6/28/17, 1:08:47 PM] Miller: great you think those are different
[6/28/17, 1:08:48 PM] Miller: so do I
[6/28/17, 1:08:49 PM] Miller: who caresd
[6/28/17, 1:08:50 PM] Steve: That's off the field issues
[6/28/17, 1:08:52 PM] Miller: teams dont
[6/28/17, 1:09:23 PM] Miller: you get so worked up about that shit, your opinion of what is GOOD or BAD off the field stuff is irrelevant
[6/28/17, 1:09:30 PM] Miller: being openly gay? thatsn an off the field issue
[6/28/17, 1:09:39 PM] Justin: Well lp you said you were explaining why and your explanation was he sat during a song
[6/28/17, 1:09:41 PM] Steve: I'm not saying what is good or bad at all
[6/28/17, 1:09:47 PM] Steve: I'm just saying that's not an issue
[6/28/17, 1:09:49 PM] Steve: That's a stance
[6/28/17, 1:09:59 PM] Miller: do i think an openly gay player should have a harder time getting a job? no of course not
[6/28/17, 1:10:00 PM] Miller: but its reality
[6/28/17, 1:10:01 PM] Justin: Sorry if I somehow misinterpreted those two statements. Please shift the goalpost as you please
[6/28/17, 1:10:05 PM] Miller: its all the same shit
[6/28/17, 1:10:06 PM] Steve: I mean clearly the beating of wife/kid is bad
[6/28/17, 1:10:13 PM] Miller: its semantics
[6/28/17, 1:10:13 PM] Miller: call it off the file issues
[6/28/17, 1:10:15 PM] Miller: call it stances
[6/28/17, 1:10:20 PM] Miller: call it lifestyle choices
[6/28/17, 1:10:22 PM] Miller: call it whatever the fuck you want
[6/28/17, 1:10:32 PM] Justin: But they aren't all equal
[6/28/17, 1:10:39 PM] Miller: teams all put it in the same box
[6/28/17, 1:10:39 PM] Miller: OFF FIELD
[6/28/17, 1:10:51 PM] Justin: So for instance being an openly gay player is more demonized than beating a kid
[6/28/17, 1:10:56 PM] Miller: great and nobody is saying they are
[6/28/17, 1:10:58 PM] Justin: Which is pretty fucken backwards
[6/28/17, 1:11:32 PM] Miller: yes great
[6/28/17, 1:11:32 PM] Miller: are we talking about reality or fairytale land?
[6/28/17, 1:11:56 PM] Miller: once again for the 8 millionth time this is not my personal; stance and i dont necesarilly condone it but its reality
[6/28/17, 1:12:07 PM] Miller: not sure why this is so compliacted
[6/28/17, 1:12:29 PM] Miller: you guys can live in this world where being openly political or gay has no repreucssions, thats great, and it would be nice, but its not the case
[6/28/17, 1:12:46 PM] Justin: but the point is that ratio you keep addressing is distorted
[6/28/17, 1:12:55 PM] Justin: anotherwords if yo beat your kid and your talent level is x fine
[6/28/17, 1:13:01 PM] Miller: back to kapernick, you cannot take the position that it is 100% due to the kneeling and then take the position that if it was tom brady he would still be playing, that is completely contradictory
[6/28/17, 1:13:03 PM] Justin: if you ar egay and talent level is x....not fine
[6/28/17, 1:13:43 PM] Justin: so that implies that depending on the off the field issue, it effects the result of wether or not you will be in the nfl
[6/28/17, 1:14:06 PM] Justin: so in kaps case, it effects it disproportionately, which is the entire point of the argument
[6/28/17, 1:14:14 PM] Miller: agreed but its impossible to quantify, i would not say being openly gay or kneeling or w/e is judged worse than beating your wife or kids or w/e
[6/28/17, 1:14:22 PM] Miller: i dont think kap is relatively worse than ray rice was
[6/28/17, 1:14:36 PM] Miller: clearly teams thought AP or greg hardy were talented enough to deal with it
[6/28/17, 1:14:59 PM] Justin: but the media backlash over the kneeeling was tremendous
[6/28/17, 1:15:07 PM] Miller: agreed
[6/28/17, 1:15:14 PM] Justin: ap beat his kid and ccnn didnt even cover it likely
[6/28/17, 1:15:26 PM] Justin: and a week later noone  cared
[6/28/17, 1:15:42 PM] Justin: meanwhile before every game redzone flashed to niners games
[6/28/17, 1:15:44 PM] Miller: i hear you, the media and fans outrage over it compared to the other horrible shit nfl players did is insane
[6/28/17, 1:16:18 PM] Justin: the point is kap would have to be aaron rodgers to be in the league
[6/28/17, 1:16:59 PM] Miller: yes, if you are a replacement level talent or worse you cannot afford to have ANYTHING in that OFF THE FIELD box
[6/28/17, 1:17:04 PM] Miller: that doesnt seem very complicated
[6/28/17, 1:17:15 PM] Miller: see rice. ray
[6/28/17, 1:17:21 PM] Justin: qb  is a weird position thoough as there is no real replacement level talent
[6/28/17, 1:17:22 PM] Miller: see vick, michael
[6/28/17, 1:17:25 PM] Miller: see peterson, AP
[6/28/17, 1:17:53 PM] Miller: we have plenty of historical examples to go off and its very easy to see why some guys get treated differently than others
[6/28/17, 1:19:13 PM] Justin: yeh but in this case there is the possibility that if kap was rodgers, he'd still be out of the league
[6/28/17, 1:19:37 PM] Justin: thats the extent to which the backlash has extended
[6/28/17, 1:19:57 PM] Miller: if that is truly your position then fine you can say the kneeling is 100% responsible for him not having a job
[6/28/17, 1:19:58 PM] Justin: fans hate him, gms hate him
[6/28/17, 1:19:57 PM] Miller: i completely disagree
[6/28/17, 1:19:58 PM] Miller: but its a hypothetical situation and we will never know
[6/28/17, 1:20:10 PM] Steve: Also you keep saying their is plenty of history of these cases
[6/28/17, 1:20:16 PM] Launchpad: thats a laughable statement
[6/28/17, 1:20:19 PM] Steve: None fbthese cases are the same as kaeps
[6/28/17, 1:20:44 PM] Steve: He is the only one being shunned for standing up for social injustices
[6/28/17, 1:20:46 PM] Justin: not more laughable than saying kaps out of the league becuase he made people angry...im just explaining that.....oh wait im not xplainging that
[6/28/17, 1:20:51 PM] Miller: yea people loved vick after he murdered dogs
[6/28/17, 1:20:54 PM] Steve: All of these other guys committed crimes
[6/28/17, 1:21:11 PM] Miller: oh my god
[6/28/17, 1:21:12 PM] Miller: steve you need to get over this equivalence issue
[6/28/17, 1:21:28 PM] Steve: Maybe you need to stop pushing t aside
[6/28/17, 1:21:30 PM] Miller: you take it personally like anyone is making the point they are equivalent
[6/28/17, 1:21:33 PM] Miller: the only point is being made is they get treated similarly
[6/28/17, 1:21:39 PM] Justin: yeh i dont think it matters why hes hated in terms of the moral reasonings behind that hatred
[6/28/17, 1:21:41 PM] Steve: And they shouldn't
[6/28/17, 1:21:49 PM] Justin: i mean tis fucked up and highlights the injustice even moreso
[6/28/17, 1:22:08 PM] Launchpad: please explain how I said that was the ONLY reason he is not in the league, and also explain how why I am agreeing with you when this statement contradicts what I've said a dozen other times
[6/28/17, 1:23:04 PM] Miller: nobody is saying that is FAIR or RIGHT
[6/28/17, 1:23:05 PM] Miller: but its reality
[6/28/17, 1:23:08 PM] Justin: I have no diea what your stance is
[6/28/17, 1:23:12 PM] Justin: you dont use statistics like miller
[6/28/17, 1:23:27 PM] Justin: miller at least has some statistical grounding in his argument
[6/28/17, 1:24:03 PM] Justin: i just think like most data, it can be interpreted to fit one's argument
[6/28/17, 1:24:22 PM] Miller: i literally just googled 2016 PFF QB ratings
[6/28/17, 1:24:25 PM] Miller: i wasnt cherry picking anything
[6/28/17, 1:24:52 PM] Justin: ok but i heard a statistic that he threw 7 passes that were itnerceptable last year
[6/28/17, 1:25:00 PM] Justin: fewest in the league
[6/28/17, 1:25:00 PM] Miller: i just think there is a talent level (for any position) at which NFL teams will just ignore/deal with any kind of blowback
[6/28/17, 1:25:17 PM] Miller: so the combination of those 2 is what drives my stance
[6/28/17, 1:25:30 PM] Miller: maybe im right maybe im wrong i dont fucking know, and we will never know b/c it is unanswerable
[6/28/17, 1:25:37 PM] Justin: and joe flacco has a 58.6 versus a 55.2
[6/28/17, 1:25:48 PM] Justin: eli has a 52.2
[6/28/17, 1:26:04 PM] Justin: bradford a 49
[6/28/17, 1:26:06 PM] Miller: steve gets all worked up b/c he thinks defending the idea that he should not be playing b/c of his kneeling
[6/28/17, 1:26:22 PM] Miller: and im saying what he did is equivalent to killing dogs or hitting women/children
[6/28/17, 1:29:00 PM] Justin: im agreeing it somehow isnt equivalent
[6/28/17, 1:29:06 PM] Justin: which is crazy, but the reality
[6/28/17, 1:29:14 PM] Miller: heres another hypothetical question how come nothing happened to mike evans? he sat during the anthem last year
[6/28/17, 1:29:28 PM] Justin: i mean if those are equivalent, thats already crazy enough
[6/28/17, 1:29:42 PM] Justin: presumably the media
[6/28/17, 1:30:00 PM] Justin: had they covered it to the degree of kaep, im sure there would be an issue
[6/28/17, 1:30:04 PM] Miller: if mike evans was a FA do you think he is unsigned?
[6/28/17, 1:30:12 PM] Justin: he sat every game?\
[6/28/17, 1:30:16 PM] Steve: You keep saying I'm getting worked up
[6/28/17, 1:30:20 PM] Miller: i think just one
[6/28/17, 1:30:21 PM] Steve: I'm pretty calm over here
[6/28/17, 1:30:24 PM] Steve: Just texting
[6/28/17, 1:30:29 PM] Steve: Can you see me?
[6/28/17, 1:30:36 PM] Steve: Are you watching me?
[6/28/17, 1:30:42 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[6/28/17, 1:30:58 PM] Miller: i dont think kap kneeled everry game did he? i thought he stopped, i cant remember
[6/28/17, 1:31:04 PM] Justin: "‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to, you know, disrespect the veterans or anything,‚Äù Evans said. ‚ÄúThe men and women who serve this country, I‚Äôm forever indebted to them. But the things that‚Äôs been going on in America lately, I‚Äôm not going to stand for that. When Ashton Kutcher comes out and says we‚Äôve been punked, then I‚Äôll stand again. But I won‚Äôt stand anymore.‚Äù
[6/28/17, 1:31:20 PM] Justin: not a single news article after the 13th
[6/28/17, 1:31:23 PM] Justin: you can google it
[6/28/17, 1:31:51 PM] Miller: so 2 other niners protested with kapernick apparently, safety Eric Reid and outside linebacker Eli Harold
[6/28/17, 1:32:04 PM] Justin: and ocne again the story became about kaep
[6/28/17, 1:32:10 PM] Justin: noone cares about the others
[6/28/17, 1:32:24 PM] Justin: could make you defend a negative
[6/28/17, 1:32:29 PM] Justin: why didnt evans continue to protest?
[6/28/17, 1:32:42 PM] Miller: why didnt kapernick?
[6/28/17, 1:32:53 PM] Justin: id say kaep had less to lose
[6/28/17, 1:33:39 PM] Justin: id assume evans was told pretty cleary, you did it once, now your done
[6/28/17, 1:33:59 PM] Justin: i mean not a single news story post that week, thats crazy
[6/28/17, 1:36:57 PM] Justin: unrelated lol
[6/28/17, 1:36:59 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-fumes-nyt-report-suggests-didnt-know-basic-elements-senate-health-care-bill-134459271.html

Trump Accuses Amazon of Not Paying 'Internet Taxes,' Which Aren't a Thing
[6/28/17, 1:38:29 PM] Justin: lol
[6/28/17, 1:40:12 PM] Justin: yeh funny hes advocating for internet taxes as hes literally changing legislation that would allow amazon to buy out the internet
[6/28/17, 1:40:29 PM] Justin: im sure hes fully versed on net neutrality as well
[6/28/17, 4:23:16 PM] Launchpad: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/low-income-families-spend-40-of-their-money-on-luxuries-2017-06-28

[6/28/17, 4:28:11 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/28/17, 4:28:29 PM] Launchpad: lol fucker, you're 3 hours ahead of me
[6/28/17, 4:28:36 PM] Launchpad: I need to pass time
[6/28/17, 4:34:14 PM] Justin: remember how i said data can be used to amke whatever story you want---see above
[6/28/17, 4:35:24 PM] Launchpad: you mean where I said multiple times there are several reasons that Kap doesn't have a job yet you chose to only fixate one one as a way of me admitting you're somehow right?
[6/28/17, 4:35:39 PM] Donk: there is only 1 reason
[6/28/17, 4:35:42 PM] Donk: we know the reason
[6/28/17, 4:35:47 PM] Justin: you makign a statement isnt data
[6/28/17, 4:35:47 PM] Donk: its because of his protests
[6/28/17, 4:35:52 PM] Launchpad: he wants too much money
[6/28/17, 4:36:14 PM] Justin: if you wnat to say this is the reason, haha you mad....no that isnt the only reason-----thats not data tellign a story
[6/28/17, 4:36:18 PM] Justin: thats you changing your story
[6/28/17, 4:37:13 PM] Launchpad: its not me changing my story -- its you interpreting a statement a certain way so it matches your own
[6/28/17, 4:38:13 PM] Justin: ok view it how you want to view it- im sorry for quoting you
[6/28/17, 4:38:24 PM] Justin: next time ill be more careful
[6/28/17, 4:38:24 PM] Launchpad: you didn't quote me
[6/28/17, 4:39:15 PM] Justin: ******
[6/28/17, 4:39:41 PM] Justin: ****
[6/28/17, 4:40:01 PM] Justin: didnt see you explain his numbers anywhere
[6/28/17, 4:40:08 PM] Launchpad: ^^^ did I say thats the only reason?
[6/28/17, 4:40:28 PM] Justin: lol you didnt say what the defintion of only is either
[6/28/17, 4:40:40 PM] Justin: or reason... why shoudl i assume you know those?
[6/28/17, 4:41:19 PM] Steve: It's not even worth the time anymore
[6/28/17, 4:41:58 PM] Launchpad: which is what a lot of GMs thought, when deciding to watch Kap tape
[6/28/17, 4:42:16 PM] Steve: Ok scott
[6/28/17, 4:42:20 PM] Steve: You're right
[6/28/17, 4:42:25 PM] Steve: You are always right
[6/28/17, 4:42:27 PM] Steve: Don't care
[6/28/17, 4:42:47 PM] Dan Watts: i wonder how much evidence it would take to convince kaepernick supporters that his protests are not the sole issue keeping him from playing? scores of players who have done worse things and are still in the league because they are better? comparable or better players out of the league? kaeps unimpressive numbers?
[6/28/17, 4:43:08 PM] Steve: Here we go with this guy
[6/28/17, 4:43:14 PM] Justin: *The survey results are based on 3041 live telephone interviews conducted nationally among adults 18+, using dual frame sampling (landline & cell phones) in cooperation with GfK Roper OmniTel. The interviewing dates were January 21 ‚Äì 25, 2015 and the margin of error is +/- 2 percentage points for the overall sample (larger for subgroups such as households with teenagers).
[6/28/17, 4:43:22 PM] Justin: thats the problem with data
[6/28/17, 4:43:23 PM] Steve: Next his new boo will chime in with more bad analogies
[6/28/17, 4:43:34 PM] Steve: Same thing, different day
[6/28/17, 4:43:51 PM] Justin: interviews 3k people askign them a question they may or may not answer honestly and extrapolate those smaples to Merica
[6/28/17, 4:44:04 PM] Steve: Surprised @17189742074 hasn't bitches about a Shaun king article in over a week
[6/28/17, 4:44:08 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/28/17, 4:44:14 PM] Launchpad: thank you fienberg
[6/28/17, 4:44:40 PM] Dan Watts: saving it for austin
[6/28/17, 4:44:54 PM] Steve: Nonneed
[6/28/17, 4:44:58 PM] Steve: I'll just walk away
[6/28/17, 4:46:10 PM] Launchpad: is your data any better?
[6/28/17, 4:46:21 PM] Steve: You haven't shown any data
[6/28/17, 4:46:30 PM] Steve: You've just piggybacked off of @15166335046
[6/28/17, 4:46:40 PM] Steve: And then said things
[6/28/17, 4:46:53 PM] Justin: no- just saying we love to draw erroenous conclusions and have invented an entire industry around it--not about better
[6/28/17, 4:47:06 PM] Justin: some data tells a real story
[6/28/17, 4:47:21 PM] Steve: And then posted breitbart articles that were picked up by the NYTimes as if we wouldn't pick up that you read breitbart
[6/28/17, 4:47:35 PM] Justin: alot of it is hogwash that we use to justify an action we want to take or an ideology we believe in
[6/28/17, 4:47:40 PM] Steve: To prove something
[6/28/17, 4:47:45 PM] Steve: Still don't know what
[6/28/17, 4:48:35 PM] Justin: also young tuks talked baout that.  Considering progressives are apparently the problem, shocking that the most progressive news outlet condemned those actions
[6/28/17, 4:48:52 PM] Justin: likely all HRC supporters in that group of dikes
[6/28/17, 4:49:03 PM] Justin: dont be blaming the intelligent left
[6/28/17, 4:50:20 PM] Justin: i perosnally dislike israel and fully condemn such stupidity
[6/28/17, 4:50:44 PM] Justin: should ahve thrown in a "condone"
[6/28/17, 4:51:02 PM] Launchpad: had no idea that was breitbart - only pointing out it happened since it wasn't mentioned in this chat
[6/28/17, 4:52:05 PM] Launchpad: There was one quote worthy line in there
[6/28/17, 4:52:07 PM] Launchpad: "Well, in practice, intersectionality functions as kind of caste system, in which people are judged according to how much their particular caste has suffered throughout history. Victimhood, in the intersectional way of seeing the world, is akin to sainthood; power and privilege are profane."
[6/28/17, 4:52:23 PM] Justin: thats not at all what it is but sure
[6/28/17, 4:52:46 PM] Justin: in¬∑ter¬∑sec¬∑tion¬∑al¬∑i¬∑ty
Àåin(t)…ôrsekSH…ôÀànal…ôdƒì/Submit
noun
the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.
[6/28/17, 4:53:11 PM] Justin: but yeh if you think finding common ground is a caste system- ok i guess
[6/28/17, 4:53:42 PM] Dan Watts: intersectionality is nonsense made up by sociology professors that have never descended from their ivory tower
[6/28/17, 4:53:52 PM] Justin: lol
[6/28/17, 4:53:56 PM] Dan Watts: do you know that 85% of social science papers are never cited again?
[6/28/17, 4:54:04 PM] Dan Watts: its because the whole institution is bullshit
[6/28/17, 4:54:12 PM] Justin: ok adn whats the number for economics papers?
[6/28/17, 4:54:18 PM] Justin: like whats that matter?
[6/28/17, 4:54:29 PM] Justin: fuck economics is literally imaginary
[6/28/17, 4:54:37 PM] Launchpad: ^^^ Thats the issue I see with 'privilege' -- some people would rather be victim than have the power to control the direction of their own life
[6/28/17, 4:54:38 PM] Dan Watts: its because theres no rigorous science or methodology going on
[6/28/17, 4:54:53 PM] Justin: tlaking about "free markets" in a world where we have governments and incomplete information
[6/28/17, 4:54:56 PM] Justin: and economics?
[6/28/17, 4:55:12 PM] Justin: its as pseudo a science as social science =---- it is a social science
[6/28/17, 4:55:47 PM] Justin: its imaginary graphs calculating imaginary results of social behavior and markets
[6/28/17, 4:56:06 PM] Justin: most pyschology is a social science as well
[6/28/17, 4:56:07 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/conceptual-penis-social-contruct-sokal-style-hoax-on-gender-studies/
[6/28/17, 4:56:08 PM] Launchpad: psychology is an important part of economics
[6/28/17, 4:56:25 PM] Justin: the only hard science is science
[6/28/17, 4:56:44 PM] Dan Watts: this guy made up a paper with no data about "the conceptual penis" and linked it to global warming
[6/28/17, 4:56:48 PM] Dan Watts: and it was PUBLISHED
[6/28/17, 4:56:59 PM] Justin: ok supply side theory
[6/28/17, 4:57:05 PM] Justin: ltierally still pushed by think tanks
[6/28/17, 4:57:05 PM] Launchpad: Unless conducted by Tim Ferris because he is not an accredited scientist
[6/28/17, 4:57:11 PM] Justin: debunked and never worked
[6/28/17, 4:57:25 PM] Justin: well if he did an actual double blidn study--- ti would be science
[6/28/17, 4:57:39 PM] Dan Watts: Manspreading ‚Äî a complaint levied against men for sitting with their legs spread wide ‚Äî is akin to raping the empty space around him.
[6/28/17, 4:57:50 PM] Launchpad: lmao
[6/28/17, 4:57:52 PM] Dan Watts: this is the type of shit they published, total nonsense
[6/28/17, 4:58:10 PM] Dan Watts: i don't think "intersectionality" is far from that
[6/28/17, 4:58:33 PM] Justin: so saying that the struggle of balck americans is similar to the struggle of palestinian children...is nonsense?
[6/28/17, 4:59:12 PM] Justin: saying that the oppresion and abuses of power structures that effects gays and lesbians also effects minorities is nonsense?
[6/28/17, 4:59:31 PM] Dan Watts: in palestine people don't have rights and are under constant threat of being bombed
[6/28/17, 4:59:37 PM] Dan Watts: no i don't think thats the same
[6/28/17, 4:59:46 PM] Justin: how about school segregation?
[6/28/17, 4:59:44 PM] Donk: palestine is not a place fwiw
[6/28/17, 4:59:56 PM] Justin: and marriage restrcitions
[6/28/17, 5:00:00 PM] Justin: and travel restrictions
[6/28/17, 5:00:02 PM] Donk: also, i dont think that two are comparable at all
[6/28/17, 5:00:13 PM] Justin: it parrallels very much so with balck aermicans
[6/28/17, 5:00:18 PM] Donk: they arise from such different events
[6/28/17, 5:00:22 PM] Donk: compelty disagree
[6/28/17, 5:00:25 PM] Kiyoon: What phone ya got Millz?
[6/28/17, 5:00:26 PM] Dan Watts: i'm so sick of this game of oppression olympics
[6/28/17, 5:00:32 PM] Kiyoon: Nice picture contrast
[6/28/17, 5:00:34 PM] Justin: its not an olympics
[6/28/17, 5:00:42 PM] Justin: its just pointing out a reality
[6/28/17, 5:00:56 PM] Justin: its not about who is poresed more- its about acknowledging their is a link between oopresion
[6/28/17, 5:01:14 PM] Justin: some people may treat it as an olympics and i agree with you, thats beyond stupid
[6/28/17, 5:01:37 PM] Justin: kinda like taking it to far iwth political correctness
[6/28/17, 5:01:52 PM] Justin: but i dont think that is at the heart of political correctness nor intersecitonality
[6/28/17, 5:02:37 PM] Justin: sadly the idiots that take it to far are often highlighted and destroy the legitamacy of the issues
[6/28/17, 5:03:05 PM] Launchpad: and end up getting spoofed on Portlandia
[6/28/17, 5:03:13 PM] Justin: havent watched it yet
[6/28/17, 5:04:45 PM] Miller: s8+
[6/28/17, 5:04:48 PM] Justin: but once again im not buying the links in articles like this to the progressive left, much more likely its the idiotic uniformed moderate left perpetuating nonsense with there surface level understanding of all issues
[6/28/17, 5:04:58 PM] Miller: ty for appreciating the artistic integrity of my beer can photo
[6/28/17, 5:05:37 PM] Justin: ill get there right one these days on first type=--- with that im done  ....should i abandon my iphone screen gonna cost 150 to fix wonder if i can get a good android in 4-500 rnage
[6/28/17, 5:06:23 PM] Kiyoon: I'm debating between s8 or pixel
[6/28/17, 5:06:29 PM] Kiyoon: Or saving money and going s7
[6/28/17, 5:07:12 PM] Launchpad: is the s8 that much better than the 7?
[6/28/17, 5:07:16 PM] Miller: unless you really care about having the newest OTA software updates s8 is a no brainer > pixel
[6/28/17, 5:07:25 PM] Miller: eh, everything is incremental
[6/28/17, 5:07:36 PM] Miller: i just upgraded b/c i like toys and they offered a pretty good trade-in deal on my s7

[6/28/17, 8:14:02 PM] Steve: Maybe it doesn't fit his narrative that white people would do that?

[7/3/17, 4:01:59 PM] Scott: give us the basic synopsis of the crazy shit
[7/3/17, 4:02:09 PM] Dan Watts: What happened in Austin stays in Austin
[7/3/17, 4:02:20 PM] Dan Watts: Or stays in the Austin chat
[7/3/17, 4:02:41 PM] Steve: #fact
[7/3/17, 4:02:58 PM] Steve: We'd tell you cheese but then we'd have to pay Adam to kill you
[7/3/17, 4:03:00 PM] Launchpad: üì†
[7/3/17, 4:03:14 PM] Dan Watts: Cheese just tried to call me to get the Austin dirt
[7/3/17, 4:03:14 PM] Scott: i
[7/3/17, 4:03:16 PM] Donk: you think you would have to pay him?
[7/3/17, 4:03:25 PM] Steve: That's also true
[7/3/17, 4:03:34 PM] Scott: i've been stuck in this office for nearly 3 straight days....i demand answers, release the transcripts
[7/3/17, 4:03:35 PM] Launchpad: just have him spend 15 minutes with him
[7/3/17, 4:03:36 PM] Steve: One more #cheesedate and he'd do it for free
[7/3/17, 4:05:10 PM] Scott: his friend offered in public, at the bar we were at, to murder my ex-wife
[7/3/17, 4:05:20 PM] Scott: it was too real.
[7/3/17, 4:05:33 PM] Launchpad: lol pretty crazy..
[7/3/17, 4:05:40 PM] Scott: i was like no.
[7/3/17, 4:05:51 PM] Scott: then stared him down and wa slike, seriously, no.
[7/3/17, 4:06:55 PM] Donk: i picture cheese as charlie in horrible bosses during that conversation
[7/3/17, 4:07:42 PM] Scott: even though it seemed in jest, it was extremely awkward
[7/3/17, 4:07:44 PM] Scott: even adam was like da fug
[7/3/17, 4:08:23 PM] Donk: you know its bad when a trained killer is taken aback
[7/3/17, 4:09:04 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/3/17, 4:09:46 PM] Scott: for meeting that guy for the first time he was way too #rideordie
[7/3/17, 4:10:14 PM] Launchpad: no
[7/3/17, 4:10:17 PM] Steve: Is that guy still in the navy seals?
[7/3/17, 4:10:23 PM] Launchpad: and spell my fucking name right
[7/3/17, 4:10:28 PM] Launchpad: Schechter
[7/3/17, 4:10:36 PM] Steve: Maybe if you are in Long enough you lose touch with reality
[7/3/17, 4:10:57 PM] Steve: You think of everyone who does wrong by you or your people as targets
[7/3/17, 4:11:34 PM] Dan Watts: Conversations to murder my ex wife = cool, posting pic of me with ex wife's face completely obstructed = not cool #cheeselogic
[7/3/17, 4:11:46 PM] Launchpad: üòÇüòÇ
[7/3/17, 4:12:12 PM] Donk: haha, got him
[7/3/17, 4:12:14 PM] Scott: coversations about is not funny
[7/3/17, 4:12:16 PM] Scott: im just saying
[7/3/17, 4:12:23 PM] Scott: that it happened
[7/3/17, 4:12:30 PM] Scott: notwithstanding, those pictures are really not cool
[7/3/17, 4:12:48 PM] Scott: and it wasn't cool i cut that shit immediately
[7/3/17, 4:12:50 PM] Scott: was nuts
[7/3/17, 4:15:37 PM] Launchpad: how many bitcoin did he want for the job?
[7/3/17, 4:18:54 PM] Scott: üëéüèº
[7/3/17, 4:19:47 PM] Donk: well given bitcoins insane uptick, you better lock him in today before it ends up being twice as expensive tommorrow
[7/3/17, 4:26:52 PM] Justin: Yeh I'm going out on a limb and saying the guy wasn't gonna murder your ex wife.
[7/3/17, 4:27:50 PM] Scott: I would tend to agree, however, the way in which he said it, the fact it was at a public location, and he shouted it, was extremely off-putting and nuts.
[7/3/17, 4:28:40 PM] Justin: Well I mean presumably all those factors make that conclusion stronger not weaker but you were there after all
[7/3/17, 4:28:48 PM] Justin: Might need to invite Adam for his input
[7/3/17, 4:29:15 PM] Steve: Yea I know criminals aren't the smartest normally
[7/3/17, 4:29:25 PM] Justin: Although since Silk Road went down I'm sure hitmen are desperate
[7/3/17, 4:29:30 PM] Steve: But I doubt anyone who will actually kill someone will shout it at a public place
[7/3/17, 4:29:42 PM] Steve: Granted, their are different levels of crazy and criminal
[7/3/17, 4:29:45 PM] Donk: an alternate silk road when up immediatly in its place
[7/3/17, 4:29:51 PM] Donk: they still have a spot to go to
[7/3/17, 4:30:15 PM] Launchpad: Lol yeah
[7/3/17, 4:30:43 PM] Launchpad: Silk road bust didnt change much
[7/3/17, 4:31:05 PM] Donk: all it meant was that someone else was pocketing all of those transaction fees
[7/3/17, 4:31:21 PM] Donk: that story of how they took the original silk road down is so great
[7/3/17, 4:31:30 PM] Donk: so many twists and turns
[7/3/17, 4:31:56 PM] Scott: i didnt' really think he was going to, but still nuts.
[7/3/17, 4:31:58 PM] Scott: that is all.
[7/3/17, 5:02:46 PM] Justin: Notice it doesn't say "welcome to Long Island "
[7/3/17, 5:03:25 PM] Scott: thats a picture from queens?
[7/3/17, 5:03:28 PM] Scott: queens island?
[7/3/17, 5:10:55 PM] Steve: That's in arizona
[7/3/17, 5:11:13 PM] Donk: Lol

[7/4/17, 8:05:52 PM] Brian Katz: That's no hooptie
[7/4/17, 8:07:45 PM] Launchpad: What would you call that
[7/4/17, 8:10:25 PM] Brian Katz: Fly as hell

[7/4/17, 9:02:45 PM] Donk: This fucking guy
[7/5/17, 10:40:02 AM] Miller: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yj4y83ygmn0lyt9/Jay-Z%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20O.J..mp4?dl=0 if anyone wants a non-tidal link to the story of OJ video
[7/5/17, 10:41:13 AM] Donk: i found it very annoying when jayz pulled everything off of spotify and a bunch of my playlists had a bunch of gaps in them
[7/5/17, 10:42:01 AM] Miller: makes no sense for him to have his stuff on spotify, i get the exclusivity and whatnot is annoying for consumers but its also your only leverage
[7/5/17, 10:55:21 AM] Donk: i get that
[7/5/17, 10:55:25 AM] Donk: but i still find it annoying
[7/5/17, 10:55:53 AM] Donk: on the flipside, he does lose out on all potential revenue from the other sites for listens to his music
[7/5/17, 10:56:06 AM] Miller: lol
[7/5/17, 10:56:11 AM] Miller: yea hes gonna miss that $14
[7/5/17, 10:56:23 AM] Donk: i have no idea if he makes more from added tidal subscriptions vs missing out on the other money
[7/5/17, 10:56:30 AM] Miller: its not even close
[7/5/17, 10:56:47 AM] Miller: use the most conservative assumptions on tidal sub increases and its still not close
[7/5/17, 10:56:48 AM] Donk: is it? how many people have added tidal because its the only place they can listen to jay-z music?
[7/5/17, 10:58:26 AM] Miller: seems impossible to quantify but they have 3m subs so in theory 360m/yr in revs
[7/5/17, 10:58:41 AM] Miller: thats assuming nobody is paying for the higher priced levels
[7/5/17, 11:00:25 AM] Donk: yeah, but we cant know how many of those were added specifically because he withdrew his music from everywhere else
[7/5/17, 11:00:40 AM] Donk: but we also have no idea how much he was making off the other services in the first place
[7/5/17, 11:00:55 AM] Dan Watts: Jay takes a shot at MillerTunes on 4:44
[7/5/17, 11:01:19 AM] Miller: i get that but hes only giving up like a few hundred k/month from not being on spotify
[7/5/17, 11:01:22 AM] Dan Watts: "N*ggas will rip you shit off of tidal just to spite you"
[7/5/17, 11:01:30 AM] Miller: see i dont do it out of spite tho
[7/5/17, 11:02:19 AM] Miller: if tidal offered no exclusives its reasonable to assume their subs would be way lower b/c otherwise whats the point?
[7/5/17, 11:02:42 AM] Miller: i think you have to assume at least 50% of those 3m people are there for the jay/ye/bey exclusives
[7/5/17, 11:03:10 AM] Donk: yeah, but at least kanye and beyonce eventually put their stuff on spotify/apple/etc after a certain period
[7/5/17, 11:03:19 AM] Donk: you cant even listen to reasonable doubt on spotify anymore
[7/5/17, 11:03:37 AM] Donk: i woudl agree that tidal would have basically no subscribers without those exclusives
[7/5/17, 11:03:48 AM] Donk: which is probalby a terrible sign for the future of tidal
[7/5/17, 11:03:55 AM] Miller: lemonade isnt on spotify either
[7/5/17, 11:04:03 AM] Launchpad: the reason why Tidal exclusive works for him is cause he owns Tidal
[7/5/17, 11:04:36 AM] Launchpad: Lemonade is a popular drink
[7/5/17, 11:05:01 AM] Miller: like sprint wasnt cutting him a 200m check for 1/3rd of tidal w/o the exclusivity of it
[7/5/17, 11:05:26 AM] Miller: and since spotify is not owned by any artists they have no exclusivity leverage
[7/5/17, 11:05:50 AM] Miller: so if you have 2 options, pay 9.99 for everything including jayz/kanye/beyonce etc.. or pay 9.99 for everything but that
[7/5/17, 11:06:16 AM] Donk: does tidal have everything that spotify does outside of that?
[7/5/17, 11:06:30 AM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[7/5/17, 11:06:39 AM] Dan Watts: And it still is
[7/5/17, 11:06:57 AM] Miller: idk for sure but personally ive never heard of anything being spotify exclusive
[7/5/17, 11:08:00 AM] Donk: yeah, didnt mean a spotify exclusive, meant more does tidal have the depth of artists/songs/albums that spotify does
[7/5/17, 11:08:37 AM] Launchpad: I just thought it was funny that Tidal was bought and promoted 'for the artist' when  its really for the already millionaire superstar artist who owns private shares
[7/5/17, 11:09:41 AM] Miller: its still for the artist
[7/5/17, 11:09:56 AM] Miller: i know the idea of artists actually profiting off their own music is disruptive
[7/5/17, 11:10:53 AM] Launchpad: its certainly within their right to profit -- but Tidal is for the Jay-Zs & Beyonces pf the world - not the artists struggling to get by
[7/5/17, 11:11:48 AM] Launchpad: its just one more streaming service - certainly not some groundbreaking business model thats revolutionizing the industry
[7/5/17, 11:11:54 AM] Miller: as opposed to spotify
[7/5/17, 11:12:08 AM] Miller: which is for neither rich nor non-rich artists
[7/5/17, 11:12:17 AM] Launchpad: ^^ which is how they hyped it when first announced
[7/5/17, 11:12:46 AM] Launchpad: also true
[7/5/17, 11:13:39 AM] Miller: Oh niggas is skeptical when it's their own shit
You bought nine iPhones and Steve Jobs is rich
Phil Knight worth trillions you still bought those kicks
Spotify is nine billion they ain't say shit
[7/5/17, 11:14:31 AM] Launchpad: speaking of iPhones, I feel like this article is just taunting me:
[7/5/17, 11:14:35 AM] Launchpad: Dallas Cowboys RB Darren McFadden is expected to serve as the No. 2 running back this season, according to David Moore of the Dallas Morning News.

[7/5/17, 11:18:58 AM] Miller: kind of curious wtf jay is "threatening" him with here, wtf did he see?
[7/5/17, 11:23:08 AM] Launchpad: is this like the end of the Jay-Z/Kanye bromance or is it more #fakebeef than Taco Bell?
[7/5/17, 11:23:27 AM] Miller: well kanye just left tidal so seems pretty legit
[7/5/17, 11:24:00 AM] Miller: ideally its all an elaborate marketing ploy for WTT2
[7/5/17, 11:25:11 AM] Donk: and tour again for it too, watch the throne was a great concert (so good that i didnt even mind that they played ni**as in paris 5 straight times to end the show)
[7/5/17, 11:26:22 AM] Miller: 444 gonna sound fantastic with a live band
[7/5/17, 11:26:45 AM] Launchpad: jesus they played the same song 5 times in a row? kind of lame
[7/5/17, 11:27:01 AM] Donk: its even lamer when you consider that it wasnt a gimmick for just one show
[7/5/17, 11:27:10 AM] Donk: they literally did that to close every single show on the tour
[7/5/17, 11:27:30 AM] Donk: but besides that, it was a great show
[7/5/17, 11:27:52 AM] Miller: pretty sure they did it 13x at the show in paris
[7/5/17, 11:29:53 AM] Donk: coincidentally, the doors five to one just came on the radio in my office (which is the sample of takeover)
[7/5/17, 11:31:34 AM] Miller: minor nuance
[7/5/17, 11:31:52 AM] Miller: but didnt josey scott actually re-create that for the song? i didnt think it was actually sampled
[7/5/17, 11:32:46 AM] Donk: not sure, but it sounds basically the same
[7/5/17, 11:33:20 AM] Miller: yea im sure either way they had to be paying them b/c its so obvious
[7/5/17, 11:33:36 AM] Launchpad: wait Josey Scott is a person?
[7/5/17, 11:34:35 AM] Miller: he was the lead signer of the band saliva if my memory is correct
[7/5/17, 11:34:41 AM] Launchpad: weird cause my ex is Josie
[7/5/17, 11:34:52 AM] Launchpad: so seeing those two names next to each other...

[7/5/17, 2:13:48 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[7/5/17, 3:47:33 PM] Launchpad: sounds 100% unlikely

[7/6/17, 2:57:59 PM] Launchpad: you mean crack shack?
[7/6/17, 2:59:39 PM] Launchpad: actually they are opening a new CFA even closer to my office now. Instead of driving 6 minutes in one direction I can go 4 minutes the other way. But there is only one other CFA in the city, so I think they picked a poor spot for distribution perposes

[7/6/17, 9:21:22 PM] Steve: Can you Facebook live it?
[7/6/17, 9:21:29 PM] Steve: Think we'd go viral

[7/6/17, 9:48:31 PM] Scott: Federal civil rights ain't a joke
[7/6/17, 9:50:18 PM] Miller: That's good because you're terrible at jokes
[7/6/17, 9:50:40 PM] Miller: And bets, feel free to Venmo me that 20 bucks anytime, contrary to the rumors my Venmo account is open
[7/6/17, 9:50:51 PM] Scott: Who says I'm telling jokes
[7/6/17, 9:51:09 PM] Launchpad: Your being the joke
[7/6/17, 9:51:35 PM] Miller: Now you're even bad at understanding jokes?
[7/6/17, 9:51:52 PM] Brian Katz: You owe me $20 bones cheese

[7/6/17, 9:53:20 PM] Miller: To be fair that's something that at least cannot be Venmod
[7/6/17, 9:53:36 PM] Miller: And despite seeing both of you a bunch haven't seen you 2 in the same place
[7/6/17, 9:53:37 PM] Scott: Why do i owe i money @16318489683
[7/6/17, 9:55:48 PM] Dan Watts: I tried paying Katz @ NYCFC game but there was no pen
[7/6/17, 9:58:02 PM] Brian Katz: Cause you guaranteed that your girl would be out your place in a week, and it's been well over a week. I have multiple witnesses to the handshake agreement, such as herman, watts, miller, steve.
[7/6/17, 9:58:44 PM] Miller: Witness

[7/6/17, 10:08:06 PM] Miller: That's correct
[7/6/17, 10:08:08 PM] Justin: but i thought he helped her find an apt
[7/6/17, 10:08:36 PM] Launchpad: A handshake agreement? You're just begging for Cheese to make you take him to small claims
[7/6/17, 10:08:40 PM] Justin: didnt think she was actually in his apt still, which would mean you lost your pride side of the bet if true
[7/6/17, 10:08:47 PM] Launchpad: Donald Cheese Trump
[7/6/17, 10:09:22 PM] Miller: The real question was she there more than a week
[7/6/17, 10:09:27 PM] Miller: Which only cheese knows
[7/6/17, 10:09:53 PM] Miller: And his memory might be fuzzy
[7/6/17, 10:09:54 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>

[7/6/17, 10:15:17 PM] Scott: Hofstra
[7/6/17, 10:15:38 PM] Brian Katz: Which has nothing to do with the duration she was there
[7/6/17, 10:15:47 PM] Scott: She wasn't her a wwek
[7/6/17, 10:15:52 PM] Scott: She was here 5 days
[7/6/17, 10:16:01 PM] Scott: And is coming back this weekend probably
[7/6/17, 10:16:03 PM] Brian Katz: I know she was there over a week
[7/6/17, 10:18:32 PM] Miller: Cheese what kind of proof do I need to submit that Marshawn lynch was drafted later than 108?
[7/6/17, 10:18:59 PM] Miller: Just want to start my mail in cheesebate claim asap because these things take 8 to 12 weeks usually
[7/6/17, 10:19:23 PM] Steve: Damn, cheese getting hit hard from everywhere

[7/6/17, 10:24:49 PM] Steve: He lost a case and a juror
[7/6/17, 10:25:05 PM] Steve: And uber is suing him now #thanksmiller
[7/6/17, 10:25:15 PM] Miller: Technically if you lose the case does the jurors matter at that point?
[7/6/17, 10:25:35 PM] Scott: Lost nothing
[7/6/17, 10:25:44 PM] Scott: 4 cops poss liable
[7/6/17, 10:25:48 PM] Steve: You just are under suspicion of witness tampering #birdlaw

[7/8/17, 8:26:08 PM] Brian Katz: An extension of San Diego
[7/8/17, 8:26:49 PM] Launchpad: we specifically relocated that brewery outside of our city thank you

[7/8/17, 9:52:45 PM] Steve: He's a specimen of a man
[7/8/17, 9:53:03 PM] Steve: Before I go over there and slap the little hair you have left on your head
[7/8/17, 10:19:19 PM] Kiyoon: Ywah Schecter you way behind son
[7/8/17, 10:19:39 PM] Kiyoon: We've evolved from paint can bree pong
[7/8/17, 10:19:42 PM] Kiyoon: Beer
[7/8/17, 10:20:08 PM] Kiyoon: To garbage can beer pong with volleyball come #seetheeastcoast
[7/8/17, 10:23:41 PM] Launchpad: Sounds kind of trashy
[7/8/17, 11:19:36 PM] Miller: Yea that shit sucks
[7/8/17, 11:20:21 PM] Steve: Did it happen like I said?
[7/8/17, 11:20:33 PM] Steve: I want to prove my integrity
[7/9/17, 6:16:34 PM] Steve: Cross island
[7/9/17, 6:19:20 PM] Dan Watts: Yuck!
[7/9/17, 6:21:04 PM] Steve: And on the other side their was a Nassau county sign
[7/9/17, 6:21:19 PM] Steve: Just couldn't take a picture while driving in the opposite direction
[7/9/17, 6:21:50 PM] Donk: The sign doesnt say leavibg long island
[7/9/17, 6:21:59 PM] Donk: Just that you are in queena
[7/9/17, 6:22:16 PM] Steve: It clearly states you entering neither the boro of queens or Nassau country
[7/9/17, 6:22:55 PM] Donk: Ok
[7/9/17, 6:22:57 PM] Donk: Agreed
[7/9/17, 6:23:05 PM] Steve: Two different places
[7/9/17, 6:23:10 PM] Scott: üé§
[7/9/17, 6:23:17 PM] Steve: If not, a sign wouldn't exist
[7/9/17, 6:23:20 PM] Donk: On one island
[7/9/17, 6:23:56 PM] Steve: Still two different places
[7/9/17, 6:24:35 PM] Donk: Yes. Queens is a different place than nassau county
[7/9/17, 6:24:42 PM] Donk: No one has ever said otherwise
[7/9/17, 6:24:47 PM] Steve: That would be like you saying Brooklyn is queens
[7/9/17, 6:24:51 PM] Steve: Hey are attached
[7/9/17, 6:24:52 PM] Launchpad: neither which is in New York
[7/9/17, 6:24:53 PM] Donk: Just that they are both om tbe same island
[7/9/17, 6:24:54 PM] Miller: There's also a sign that says entering Bethpage
[7/9/17, 6:24:55 PM] Steve: Hence they are he same
[7/9/17, 6:24:58 PM] Launchpad: because they are on Long Island
[7/9/17, 6:25:19 PM] Steve: Bronx and manhattan are also the same
[7/9/17, 6:25:23 PM] Steve: They are attached by land
[7/9/17, 6:25:41 PM] Steve: So when you are at Yankee stadium you are still on manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:27:15 PM] Miller: Yes and they are also all French fries and sandwiches
[7/9/17, 6:27:31 PM] Steve: Let me know what I should call Brooklyn from now on
[7/9/17, 6:27:37 PM] Steve: Since it's in queens
[7/9/17, 6:27:46 PM] Donk: Yeah that has nothing to do with queens being part of long island
[7/9/17, 6:27:48 PM] Steve: Can't call it Brooklyn, obvi
[7/9/17, 6:27:53 PM] Steve: Right
[7/9/17, 6:28:00 PM] Steve: Because you say so
[7/9/17, 6:28:14 PM] Donk: Bit because i say so
[7/9/17, 6:28:20 PM] Donk: Because it is a fact
[7/9/17, 6:28:22 PM] Steve: Or is Brooklyn Long Island also?
[7/9/17, 6:28:29 PM] Steve: Says you
[7/9/17, 6:28:32 PM] Donk: Not because that is
[7/9/17, 6:28:33 PM] Steve: Again
[7/9/17, 6:28:38 PM] Donk: Says geography
[7/9/17, 6:28:45 PM] Steve: So Brooklyn is Long Island also
[7/9/17, 6:28:50 PM] Steve: It is attached to queens
[7/9/17, 6:28:56 PM] Steve: Which is attached to Long Island
[7/9/17, 6:29:08 PM] Steve: Hence Brooklyn=Long Island
[7/9/17, 6:29:59 PM] Donk: Yes
[7/9/17, 6:30:19 PM] Donk: It is
[7/9/17, 6:30:43 PM] Brian Katz: You're getting it steve
[7/9/17, 6:31:03 PM] Steve: So Brooklyn and queens are Long Island lol
[7/9/17, 6:31:09 PM] Steve: Sounds good
[7/9/17, 6:31:18 PM] Steve: Please refer to them all as Long Island from now on
[7/9/17, 6:31:21 PM] Scott: Every part of new york is long island
[7/9/17, 6:31:35 PM] Steve: Aaahhhhh
[7/9/17, 6:32:05 PM] Steve: Well manhattan technically doesn't touch queens or Brooklyn
[7/9/17, 6:32:20 PM] Steve: Neither does the Bronx or Staten Island
[7/9/17, 6:32:24 PM] Brian Katz: No there's Manhattan Staten Island and then the rest of New York
[7/9/17, 6:32:33 PM] Miller: Also please refer to long Island as strong island going forward ty
[7/9/17, 6:32:42 PM] Steve: So technically the city only has 3 boroughs
[7/9/17, 6:33:05 PM] Donk: No, it has 5 but 2 are on long island
[7/9/17, 6:33:06 PM] Brian Katz: No it has five Boros but two are on Long Island
[7/9/17, 6:33:10 PM] Donk: Lol
[7/9/17, 6:33:20 PM] Miller: No it has 5 but 2 are on strong island
[7/9/17, 6:33:22 PM] Brian Katz: lol Donk gets it
[7/9/17, 6:33:22 PM] Steve: Sorry that makes no sense
[7/9/17, 6:34:10 PM] Steve: Also katz said those signs didn't exist
[7/9/17, 6:34:20 PM] Steve: I'm waiting for an apology
[7/9/17, 6:34:24 PM] Steve: Whenever you'd like
[7/9/17, 6:35:03 PM] Steve: Don't need watts accusing me of having no integrity again
[7/9/17, 6:35:10 PM] Scott: No it has 5 but 2 are on long island.
[7/9/17, 6:35:13 PM] Scott: üí£
[7/9/17, 6:36:19 PM] Brian Katz: It says the boro of queens,  not queens
[7/9/17, 6:36:30 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/9/17, 6:37:47 PM] Donk: Haiti and the dr being separate countries on the same island must blow steves mind
[7/9/17, 6:38:08 PM] Steve: Not at all
[7/9/17, 6:38:21 PM] Steve: France and Spain are also attached
[7/9/17, 6:38:27 PM] Steve: Still two different countries
[7/9/17, 6:38:36 PM] Steve: Portugal is literally in Spain
[7/9/17, 6:38:49 PM] Steve: No one calls it part of Spain
[7/9/17, 6:39:51 PM] Steve: The same way no one refers to Brooklyn as Long Island
[7/9/17, 6:40:00 PM] Donk: Ok
[7/9/17, 6:40:15 PM] Steve: Or queens for that matter
[7/9/17, 6:40:21 PM] Steve: Are they attached, yes
[7/9/17, 6:40:36 PM] Steve: Are they the same, nope
[7/9/17, 6:40:40 PM] Donk: However even though people dont mean queens and Brooklyn when tbey say going to long island, they are still physically part of long island
[7/9/17, 6:40:48 PM] Steve: Great
[7/9/17, 6:40:51 PM] Donk: Not that hard to understand
[7/9/17, 6:41:05 PM] Steve: When I say I'm going to Portugal it is still technically part of Spain
[7/9/17, 6:41:19 PM] Scott: #arrogantdonk at it again.
[7/9/17, 6:41:24 PM] Steve: Still doesn't mean I'm going to a different parrr if Spain
[7/9/17, 6:41:31 PM] Steve: It means I'm going to Portugal
[7/9/17, 6:41:33 PM] Donk: No, thats not the same
[7/9/17, 6:41:54 PM] Donk: Thats very different actually
[7/9/17, 6:42:07 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/9/17, 6:42:09 PM] Steve: Ok
[7/9/17, 6:42:16 PM] Steve: I'll bring it down to a smaller scale
[7/9/17, 6:43:16 PM] Steve: It's like you saying the Bronx is manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:43:22 PM] Steve: They are attached
[7/9/17, 6:43:38 PM] Brian Katz: It is in Manhattan foo
[7/9/17, 6:43:38 PM] Steve: So the Bronx is manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:43:55 PM] Steve: It's not in manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:44:00 PM] Steve: It's above manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:44:06 PM] Steve: Central Park is in manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:44:08 PM] Brian Katz: It is in Manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:44:24 PM] Miller: Can't decide if this rage quit is going to be stupider than Feinberg rage quitting over Tony Romo
[7/9/17, 6:44:28 PM] Steve: The LES is in manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:44:38 PM] Brian Katz: Lol @miller
[7/9/17, 6:45:03 PM] Donk: Bronx is not connected to manhattab by land
[7/9/17, 6:45:21 PM] Launchpad: Long Island is just the name of a geographic feature
[7/9/17, 6:45:28 PM] Brian Katz: Did I cross a bridge to get there from Harlem?
[7/9/17, 6:45:41 PM] Donk: So that ruins your whole arguement
[7/9/17, 6:45:46 PM] Steve: You took the Harlem river drive
[7/9/17, 6:45:50 PM] Steve: Which is a highway
[7/9/17, 6:45:54 PM] Steve: Same as the LIE
[7/9/17, 6:46:04 PM] Donk: Where you use a bridge
[7/9/17, 6:46:15 PM] Donk: To cross in between thr bronx and Manhattan
[7/9/17, 6:46:16 PM] Brian Katz: I'm not a Bronx expert lol
[7/9/17, 6:46:19 PM] Steve: Not necessarily
[7/9/17, 6:46:21 PM] Donk: Yes
[7/9/17, 6:46:24 PM] Donk: Every time
[7/9/17, 6:46:26 PM] Steve: That's only on one part
[7/9/17, 6:46:32 PM] Steve: Most of it is highway
[7/9/17, 6:46:44 PM] Donk: Yes, but that part takes you over eater
[7/9/17, 6:46:49 PM] Donk: Look at google maps
[7/9/17, 6:46:59 PM] Miller: He only has apple maps
[7/9/17, 6:49:01 PM] Steve: I do exclusively use apple maps
[7/9/17, 6:52:04 PM] Donk: I take it you looked at a map
[7/9/17, 6:52:14 PM] Steve: I'm still driving
[7/9/17, 6:52:37 PM] Steve: But I'm sure you are right
[7/9/17, 6:52:47 PM] Donk: You have been texting a lot for someone driving lol
[7/9/17, 6:52:55 PM] Steve: Stuck in traffic
[7/9/17, 6:59:48 PM] Dan Watts: Bronx is technically upstate if you go by the Brooklyn is LI logic
[7/9/17, 7:12:54 PM] Launchpad: you mean yonkers
[7/9/17, 7:25:58 PM] Dan Watts: No I mean bronx, it's the on the same body of land
[7/9/17, 7:26:17 PM] Dan Watts: Yonkers too
[7/9/17, 7:26:46 PM] Launchpad: upstate has nothing to do with body of land, it just means north of NYC
[7/9/17, 7:27:04 PM] Launchpad: **Westchester
[7/9/17, 7:32:43 PM] Justin: Yeh Bronx thing blows my mind
[7/9/17, 7:33:03 PM] Justin: I assume I just never realize I'm going over water
[7/9/17, 7:59:59 PM] Scott: ‚õ∑
[7/9/17, 8:03:34 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/10/17, 8:30:17 AM] Scott: Lpl

[7/10/17, 8:34:36 AM] Miller: ctrl F "jews"...no results.......we good
[7/10/17, 8:35:51 AM] Donk: 20% of people dont tip at all?
[7/10/17, 8:35:54 AM] Donk: Thats crazy
[7/10/17, 10:06:59 AM] Launchpad: hahaha is this real? I didn't realize the hot dog / sandwich debate was a national issue
[7/10/17, 10:11:27 AM] Launchpad: Wow...these rich old white men are now using their privilege to exert their patriarchal dominance and make us look stupid and feel bad. They should be tipping equally like the rest of us. #disgusting #equaltips #itsnotright
[7/10/17, 10:14:03 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/10/17, 10:17:42 AM] Launchpad: btw that joey chestnut answer was very larry david like
[7/10/17, 10:24:10 AM] Launchpad: the only great mysteries of our time left are 'is a tater tot a french fry' & 'is queens on Long Island'
[7/10/17, 10:24:58 AM] Steve: Is queens on Long Island is not the question
[7/10/17, 10:25:09 AM] Steve: The statement is queens is Long Island
[7/10/17, 10:25:16 AM] Donk: are you kidding me
[7/10/17, 10:25:19 AM] Miller: the question is queens a french fry
[7/10/17, 10:25:30 AM] Steve: Queens is queens
[7/10/17, 10:25:35 AM] Steve: Long Island is Long Island
[7/10/17, 10:25:44 AM] Launchpad: doesn't even know the question üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[7/10/17, 10:25:52 AM] Steve: Oh I know the question
[7/10/17, 10:25:53 AM] Donk: lol, you ahve been arguing for months that queen inst part of long island, and now you are walking that claim back?
[7/10/17, 10:25:58 AM] Donk: get out of here
[7/10/17, 10:25:59 AM] Steve: It isn't
[7/10/17, 10:26:03 AM] Steve: I didn't say it isn't attached
[7/10/17, 10:26:08 AM] Steve: I know it's attached
[7/10/17, 10:26:20 AM] Steve: But you are saying they are both Long Island
[7/10/17, 10:26:23 AM] Steve: And they are not
[7/10/17, 10:26:38 AM] Steve: I have been arguing for months that queens is not Long Island
[7/10/17, 10:26:42 AM] Steve: Which it isn't
[7/10/17, 10:26:49 AM] Donk: you have lost
[7/10/17, 10:26:50 AM] Steve: Not that they aren't attached
[7/10/17, 10:26:57 AM] Steve: Clearly they are attached
[7/10/17, 10:26:58 AM] Donk: its over now
[7/10/17, 10:27:07 AM] Launchpad: it is not long island itself....it is ON long island
[7/10/17, 10:27:15 AM] Steve: Still doesn't make queens Long Island
[7/10/17, 10:27:26 AM] Launchpad: no it makes queens ON long island
[7/10/17, 10:27:26 AM] Steve: It's attached to Long Island
[7/10/17, 10:27:40 AM] Steve: Or does it make Long Island on queens?
[7/10/17, 10:27:54 AM] Donk: you still dont get it
[7/10/17, 10:27:55 AM] Launchpad: no
[7/10/17, 10:28:39 AM] Steve: Who knows?
[7/10/17, 10:28:40 AM] Launchpad: queens is a political boundary, long island is a geographic boundary.  They are allowed to overlap
[7/10/17, 10:28:43 AM] Steve: No one will ever know
[7/10/17, 10:29:34 AM] Steve: I don't need you to mansplain
[7/10/17, 10:30:37 AM] Launchpad: I tip well so I'm allowed to mansplain
[7/10/17, 10:30:42 AM] Launchpad: Also
[7/10/17, 10:30:50 AM] Steve: That's not a thing
[7/10/17, 10:30:51 AM] Launchpad: I'm a good person
[7/10/17, 10:30:55 AM] Steve: You also probably don't tip well
[7/10/17, 10:31:00 AM] Steve: Because you are cheap
[7/10/17, 10:31:08 AM] Steve: And you are also not a good person
[7/10/17, 10:31:12 AM] Launchpad: false
[7/10/17, 10:31:17 AM] Launchpad: on all accounts
[7/10/17, 10:31:19 AM] Steve: You are just a sucker to homeless men in Austin
[7/10/17, 11:50:03 AM] Miller: if anyone wants to go see jay 12/2 @ nassau coliseum lmk asap as possible ty
[7/10/17, 12:50:23 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/10/17, 12:51:12 PM] Miller: i would not recommend you go
[7/10/17, 12:51:48 PM] Launchpad: thats a pretty good recommendation, thanks
[7/10/17, 1:19:53 PM] Justin: @17189742074 https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/opinion/media-alt-right-evergreen-college.html?mc=aud_dev&mcid=keywee&mccr=dommob&kwp_0=454376&kwp_4=1662225&kwp_1=714733&referer=https://m.facebook.com/
[7/10/17, 1:20:22 PM] Miller: watts is in hiding
[7/10/17, 1:20:30 PM] Miller: not even 1 comment on linda sarsour and her jihad
[7/10/17, 1:22:15 PM] Justin: Lol.  I'm breaking out the students shut down the campus to enforce. NO whites day turning into death threats from nazis and alt right
[7/10/17, 1:22:55 PM] Justin: And shockingly professor was t fired for students protesting him, not an overblown original story though
[7/10/17, 1:36:40 PM] Dan Watts: Ok that's an op ed
[7/10/17, 1:37:24 PM] Dan Watts: And watch the videos of these psychos threatening Bret Weinstein
[7/10/17, 1:38:48 PM] Justin: Congrats alt right feels same way
[7/10/17, 1:38:53 PM] Dan Watts: That was so absurd I didn't find the need to comment in it
[7/10/17, 1:39:15 PM] Dan Watts: Idk what this congratulations is
[7/10/17, 1:39:20 PM] Justin: In fact they are defending him because it was such dangerous protesting
[7/10/17, 1:41:23 PM] Dan Watts: @16316620763 you realize this one students opinion right
[7/10/17, 1:41:38 PM] Justin: And the other side is?
[7/10/17, 1:42:02 PM] Justin: What I'm saying is Perhaps our perception of events is overblown by media coverage.
[7/10/17, 1:42:23 PM] Dan Watts: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LTnDpoQLNaY
[7/10/17, 1:42:26 PM] Justin: The rea consequences of that in a circle of intelligent human beings is arguing on Facebook.
[7/10/17, 1:42:26 PM] Dan Watts: Watch this
[7/10/17, 1:42:43 PM] Dan Watts: There's no room for interpretation what's going on in this video
[7/10/17, 1:42:52 PM] Justin: But w unintelligent human beings it's dangerous
[7/10/17, 1:42:53 PM] Dan Watts: And there's about a dozen like this or worse
[7/10/17, 1:45:02 PM] Justin: Can't watch it now watched like 30 seconds
[7/10/17, 1:45:18 PM] Justin: I mean is that shocking though?
[7/10/17, 1:45:59 PM] Justin: 25 19 yo gather together w emotions
[7/10/17, 1:46:15 PM] Justin: I'd expecting yelling and profanity
[7/10/17, 1:46:37 PM] Justin: Although I didn't watch whole video, of someone worse happened ?
[7/10/17, 1:48:05 PM] Justin: From what I saw there and originally read. Professor seems calm and collected
[7/10/17, 1:48:53 PM] Dan Watts: yeah he is
[7/10/17, 1:49:13 PM] Dan Watts: nothing like that went on at binghamton
[7/10/17, 1:49:29 PM] Donk: different time though
[7/10/17, 1:49:32 PM] Dan Watts: or any other college ever, except maybe kent state when they were protesting an actual war
[7/10/17, 1:49:34 PM] Donk: we went to binghamton 15 years ago
[7/10/17, 1:50:06 PM] Dan Watts: so now gathering like a mob and cornering your professor is ok?
[7/10/17, 1:50:35 PM] Dan Watts: also i don't know enough about kekistan, but they will tell you they aren't alt right
[7/10/17, 1:51:54 PM] Donk: on a different note
[7/10/17, 1:51:58 PM] Donk: this is terrifying
[7/10/17, 1:51:59 PM] Donk: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html
[7/10/17, 1:53:59 PM] Steve: That's fake news
[7/10/17, 1:54:04 PM] Steve: My president says it's a hoax
[7/10/17, 1:55:58 PM] Miller: jesus donk post a longer article with more words
[7/10/17, 1:57:19 PM] Dan Watts: elon musk needs to figure out a solution
[7/10/17, 2:00:19 PM] Launchpad: my money is on technology saving us before we destroy the planet
[7/10/17, 2:01:51 PM] Launchpad: "As soon as several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year."
[7/10/17, 2:01:59 PM] Launchpad: anyone gotta snarky comment?
[7/10/17, 2:05:08 PM] Brian Katz: Anyone else psyched for the new apes movie?
[7/10/17, 2:05:12 PM] Donk: yeah, and this is why people dont believe in climate change lol
[7/10/17, 2:05:24 PM] Donk: i am, i liked the last two

[7/10/17, 6:00:49 PM] Steve: They deliver everywhere
[7/10/17, 6:01:02 PM] Steve: Don't know what that has to do with it being a printed newspaper
[7/10/17, 6:01:10 PM] Steve: That also has a digital page
[7/10/17, 6:01:18 PM] Steve: But it is a newspaper
[7/10/17, 6:01:41 PM] Launchpad: its either a newspaper or webpage

[7/10/17, 6:03:50 PM] Steve: Not sure about that

[7/11/17, 11:28:35 AM] Steve: Nooo
[7/11/17, 11:28:46 AM] Steve: But it's an app to rent it out to people in my area
[7/11/17, 11:29:07 AM] Steve: Not a bad deal just wanted to see if anyone knew/heard/read anything about it
[7/11/17, 11:30:06 AM] Launchpad: theres also Turo which does the same thing
[7/11/17, 11:30:38 AM] Launchpad: used it once
[7/11/17, 11:30:52 AM] Steve: How was it?

[7/11/17, 11:31:12 AM] Steve: And how do you leave your key with the person?
[7/11/17, 11:31:48 AM] Launchpad: we had to meet the guy, which wasn't really the most convenient thing but whatever
[7/11/17, 11:32:00 AM] Launchpad: I'm sure you can install a lock box & change the code each day
[7/11/17, 11:34:22 AM] Kiyoon: whats the insurance on that?
[7/11/17, 11:34:29 AM] Kiyoon: insurance coverage
[7/11/17, 11:35:28 AM] Launchpad: dont know
[7/11/17, 11:42:53 AM] Donk: yeah, seems like a bad idea to me
[7/11/17, 11:43:03 AM] Donk: esp when things like zip car exist
[7/11/17, 11:43:25 AM] Donk: i think it would be fine to use if you were the one borrowing the car, but a shitty deal on the lender side unless th emoney is just ridiculous
[7/11/17, 11:43:49 AM] Donk: i could easily see a situation where you lend the car, it gets wrecked, and your insurance company denies coverage since it was being used commericially
[7/11/17, 11:44:29 AM] Miller: same as airbnb
[7/11/17, 11:44:36 AM] Miller: seems great from a consumer perspective

[7/11/17, 11:46:28 AM] Launchpad: does it still exist?
[7/11/17, 11:47:10 AM] Donk: its big in NY
[7/11/17, 11:48:08 AM] Kiyoon: and DC
[7/11/17, 11:48:11 AM] Donk: SD has places to park cars that dont cost 400+ a month, so less of a need
[7/11/17, 11:48:12 AM] Launchpad: it starting getting big for like a year or two around here then got crushed by Uber & Lyft
[7/11/17, 11:48:16 AM] Kiyoon: cars2go as well
[7/11/17, 11:48:26 AM] Launchpad: true
[7/11/17, 11:48:38 AM] Launchpad: also Uber is I think even cheaper here than NY
[7/11/17, 11:48:53 AM] Donk: uber/lyft also fill a different need than zipcar imo
[7/11/17, 11:49:00 AM] Launchpad: why pay for a zip car you cant drive drunk
[7/11/17, 11:49:14 AM] Donk: you want to go away for the weekend?
[7/11/17, 12:17:11 PM] Launchpad: i guess but thats a much smaller use case
[7/11/17, 12:22:10 PM] Donk: i know people who use it for things like costo/ikea, or going to a concert out in jersey or long island, or things like that in addition to the weekend trips. i dont know though, ive never used it, but i do see the zipcars on the road a fair amount
[7/11/17, 12:22:51 PM] Donk: from what i have heard, it works great in cities where people dont have cars, or places like college campuses with the same situation

[7/11/17, 2:17:33 PM] Miller: He's not wrong, it's impossible to work with one monitor if you do any kind of data entry
[7/11/17, 2:17:35 PM] Steve: Because you go out to dive bars that are cheap

[7/11/17, 2:22:23 PM] Steve: same with cheese
[7/11/17, 2:22:33 PM] Steve: It's just them fucking with you
[7/11/17, 2:22:41 PM] Launchpad: maybe you should stop being so cheap and buy a map, so you'll understand how geography works
[7/11/17, 2:23:02 PM] Launchpad: Buys only 1 bottle of sunblock --> cheap
[7/11/17, 2:23:15 PM] Steve: Did you use our afterwards?
[7/11/17, 2:23:22 PM] Steve: When your sunblock ran out?
[7/11/17, 2:23:31 PM] Kiyoon: yeah I second Donk
[7/11/17, 2:23:32 PM] Steve: Also, I don't need a map
[7/11/17, 2:23:38 PM] Kiyoon: I can never go back to working on one screen
[7/11/17, 2:23:42 PM] Steve: I "know how geography works"
[7/11/17, 2:23:52 PM] Kiyoon: when I travel for work I request that there is a monitor there so I can have a screen ont he laptop and monitor
[7/11/17, 2:23:58 PM] Launchpad: I did cause Im cheap
[7/11/17, 2:24:22 PM] Steve: And a dumbass who thinks half a tube of sunscreen will last you 4 days
[7/11/17, 2:24:28 PM] Steve: But also cheap
[7/11/17, 2:24:47 PM] Steve: Last you 4 days in hot, sun soaked Austin no less
[7/11/17, 2:24:54 PM] Donk: my dad mails a monitor ahead to his hotel when he travels to conferences for work
[7/11/17, 2:25:16 PM] Donk: #2screenlife
[7/11/17, 2:25:42 PM] Launchpad: 2 screens plus laptop screen
[7/11/17, 2:25:53 PM] Miller: they actually make multi-screened laptops
[7/11/17, 2:26:25 PM] Donk: ive never seen those
[7/11/17, 2:26:29 PM] Donk: but that oculd be a game changer
[7/11/17, 2:26:33 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/11/17, 2:27:23 PM] Kiyoon: engineers here have that
[7/11/17, 2:27:23 PM] Kiyoon: pretty legit
[7/11/17, 2:27:23 PM] Kiyoon: also mad money
[7/11/17, 2:27:25 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/11/17, 2:27:53 PM] Kiyoon: yeah Miller has like 6 screens in his home office
[7/11/17, 2:28:03 PM] Kiyoon: Herman would love it
[7/11/17, 2:28:30 PM] Miller: i only have 2 in my home offfice and a TV
[7/11/17, 2:28:34 PM] Miller: granted theyre both like 40 inches
[7/11/17, 2:28:43 PM] Steve: Herman has 2 screens at home also
[7/11/17, 2:28:43 PM] Launchpad: nic
[7/11/17, 2:28:48 PM] Steve: One is a Tv
[7/11/17, 2:28:51 PM] Launchpad: I do want more screens at home
[7/11/17, 2:28:59 PM] Launchpad: i need a bigger desk though
[7/11/17, 2:29:20 PM] Launchpad: my 1 screen is probably similar size to all 4
[7/11/17, 2:29:38 PM] Miller: doubt that
[7/11/17, 2:29:43 PM] Miller: these are like 27 inches each
[7/11/17, 2:50:44 PM] Justin: Nonsense I do not use tv as a computer screen
[7/11/17, 2:51:32 PM] Justin: I'm sure I would these days. But I instead spend 3x the price on high resolution monitors
[7/11/17, 2:52:20 PM] Justin: I'm guessing in the world of 4K there isn't much a difference anymore, but 1080p was never enough
[7/11/17, 2:54:35 PM] Miller: yea 4k is a big difference in the using-a-tv-as-a-monotir
[7/11/17, 2:58:10 PM] Steve: My mistake
[7/11/17, 2:58:17 PM] Steve: Thought you used a tv screen
[7/11/17, 3:12:21 PM] Launchpad: my 1080i tv is fine -- my old 42" 720p was atrocious
[7/11/17, 5:15:01 PM] Launchpad: best thing I found so far on Prime day:
[7/11/17, 5:15:05 PM] Launchpad: Service Order 1 of 1

    Deep Cleaning - 2 bedrooms + Inside Cabinets (est. 5-6 working hours)
    $189.39  $113.63 - Quantity: 1
[7/11/17, 5:15:30 PM] Donk: They had a buy a 25.00 gift card, get a free 5.00 credit
[7/11/17, 5:15:51 PM] Miller: yea launchpad if you had signed up for 4000 amzn accounts you could have made 20k in free $
[7/11/17, 5:15:53 PM] Launchpad: would a cheap person pay someone else to clean their house?
[7/11/17, 5:15:59 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/11/17, 5:16:02 PM] Kiyoon: theres actually a lot of deals on other sites to combat the amazon prime day
[7/11/17, 5:16:09 PM] Kiyoon: I got boat shoes and shorts for $40
[7/11/17, 5:16:12 PM] Kiyoon: on Macys
[7/11/17, 5:16:13 PM] Miller: depends if your cheapness outweighs your laziness or vice versa
[7/11/17, 5:16:21 PM] Launchpad: to place approx. one bet against you
[7/11/17, 5:16:35 PM] Kiyoon: donk is that deal over?
[7/11/17, 5:17:45 PM] Launchpad: i assume you can only do that once?
[7/11/17, 5:18:20 PM] Donk: Not sure if its over and yes, as far as i know
[7/11/17, 5:18:28 PM] Donk: Didn't try to game it
[7/11/17, 5:18:50 PM] Launchpad: cause the Prime credit card is just 5% off everything on amazon
[7/11/17, 5:18:53 PM] Launchpad: (5% back)
[7/11/17, 5:20:07 PM] Justin: So use prime cc to buy gc and get that 5%?
[7/11/17, 5:20:38 PM] Launchpad: not sure if that qualifies
[7/11/17, 5:20:50 PM] Launchpad: but in theory it might
[7/11/17, 5:21:09 PM] Launchpad: I'm getting an extra 5% back on the 40% saved on the cleaning
[7/11/17, 5:49:52 PM] Launchpad: cheap people generally do an unnecessary amount of work to avoid spending money
[7/11/17, 5:50:12 PM] Launchpad: its hard being lazy AND cheap, unless you just stay in your house all day
[7/11/17, 10:11:37 PM] Launchpad: thats fucken hilarious
[7/11/17, 10:17:21 PM] Dan Watts: Equally hilarious was that he said he would knock Floyd out in under 4 rounds
[7/11/17, 10:17:47 PM] Steve: I mean, what else would he say?
[7/11/17, 10:17:55 PM] Steve: I'm losing and shouldn't even fight? Lol
[7/11/17, 10:18:06 PM] Steve: That's the truth
[7/11/17, 10:18:23 PM] Dan Watts: KO in 4 rounds is a bit ambitious
[7/11/17, 10:18:23 PM] Launchpad: "Sir, its an honor to be standing here next to you"
[7/11/17, 10:18:34 PM] Miller: Is McGregor looking at a picture of himself in that suit?
[7/11/17, 10:18:37 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/11/17, 10:18:55 PM] Justin: Betting like seemed to move a lot towards him on Vegas sheet I grabbed
[7/11/17, 10:18:58 PM] Launchpad: thats his only viable plan...hes not going to win by decision
[7/11/17, 10:19:01 PM] Steve: Because mcgregor is known to be humble and down to earth lol
[7/11/17, 10:19:40 PM] Justin: Still pretty big dog
[7/11/17, 10:19:57 PM] Miller: Mayweather odds went down also somehow
[7/11/17, 10:20:06 PM] Miller: Went from minus 1200 to minus 700
[7/11/17, 10:20:20 PM] Justin: So much money must went in on mcgregor
[7/11/17, 10:20:27 PM] Steve: Mcgregors only shot is to get one square hit
[7/11/17, 10:20:37 PM] Steve: Which probably won't happen
[7/11/17, 10:20:52 PM] Miller: Well nobody has been able to in like 5 years
[7/11/17, 10:20:55 PM] Miller: So yea
[7/11/17, 10:21:05 PM] Justin: Go 9 rounds seems like decent bet
[7/11/17, 10:21:28 PM] Justin: But I guess mayweather could just score knockout
[7/11/17, 10:21:34 PM] Miller: Idk what his stamina is like
[7/11/17, 10:21:43 PM] Miller: Aren't ufc fights mad short?
[7/11/17, 10:21:53 PM] Launchpad: Aaron Judge could do it
[7/11/17, 10:22:20 PM] Steve: 5 rounds
[7/11/17, 10:22:21 PM] Miller: God this fight is going to be so bad
[7/11/17, 10:22:26 PM] Steve: 5 minutes each
[7/11/17, 10:23:28 PM] Kiyoon: if you gonna bet on mcgregor do it right before the fight
[7/11/17, 10:23:42 PM] Kiyoon: all the smart money gonna come in that day
[7/11/17, 10:24:01 PM] Steve: #KYhottaek
[7/11/17, 10:24:16 PM] Kiyoon: I wanna bet on mcgregor so bad
[7/11/17, 10:24:18 PM] Kiyoon: but probably a dumb bet
[7/11/17, 10:24:55 PM] Miller: They're counting on people betting on him because they want to see it happen
[7/11/17, 10:25:02 PM] Miller: Not betting based on realism
[7/12/17, 9:42:24 AM] Miller: https://ny.eater.com/2017/7/10/15945712/chipotle-queso-margaritas-chelsea
[7/12/17, 9:59:15 AM] Steve: Mmmmmmmm e.coli in cheese form
[7/12/17, 10:04:33 AM] Donk: you ever eat mcdonalds, burgerking or kfc? (or probably any fast food resturant)
[7/12/17, 10:04:53 AM] Donk: because they have all had ecoli breakouts
[7/12/17, 10:05:00 AM] Miller: bww
[7/12/17, 10:05:22 AM] Steve: Burger King and KFC no
[7/12/17, 10:05:31 AM] Steve: McDonald's I've had but not in a while
[7/12/17, 10:06:32 AM] Brian Katz: I like Burger King a lot, but I'm never near one
[7/12/17, 10:06:58 AM] Donk: i feel like i have the oppsoite problem
[7/12/17, 10:07:06 AM] Donk: dont really care for bk, but they are everywhere
[7/12/17, 10:07:12 AM] Steve: Fast food place I eat is Taco Bell
[7/12/17, 10:07:16 AM] Steve: If any at all
[7/12/17, 10:07:30 AM] Steve: Wendy's is my favorite other than Taco Bell
[7/12/17, 10:07:34 AM] Donk: and taco bell has had ecoli breakouts in the past
[7/12/17, 10:07:43 AM] Steve: I only get coffee from McDonald's in the last 3-5 years
[7/12/17, 10:07:45 AM] Donk: and wendys
[7/12/17, 10:08:09 AM] Steve: I'm sure they have
[7/12/17, 10:08:19 AM] Steve: But they also didn't shut down nationwide for days last year because of it
[7/12/17, 10:08:38 AM] Scott: Mcdonalds coffee any good?
[7/12/17, 10:08:43 AM] Steve: It's delicious
[7/12/17, 10:08:44 AM] Donk: i think that they woudl have had the outbreaks happened int he social media era
[7/12/17, 10:08:48 AM] Brian Katz: It's hit for sure
[7/12/17, 10:08:48 AM] Steve: Better than dunkin
[7/12/17, 10:08:51 AM] Donk: i think that was a major contributing factor
[7/12/17, 10:09:00 AM] Steve: Sure
[7/12/17, 10:09:04 AM] Brian Katz: Hot*
[7/12/17, 10:09:07 AM] Donk: (to them closign for a day)
[7/12/17, 10:09:14 AM] Donk: and it was really only a morning i thought
[7/12/17, 10:10:15 AM] Steve: Closed an entire day
[7/12/17, 10:10:19 AM] Steve: February 8th
[7/12/17, 10:10:29 AM] Brian Katz: I like the burgers better at Burger King
[7/12/17, 10:10:38 AM] Steve: For an all staff meeting on food safety
[7/12/17, 10:10:42 AM] Brian Katz: I like checkers too
[7/12/17, 10:10:46 AM] Steve: Which shouldn't really be a thing
[7/12/17, 10:10:50 AM] Brian Katz: Fries are fire
[7/12/17, 10:10:54 AM] Steve: You should be practicing food safety always lol
[7/12/17, 10:11:10 AM] Steve: Checkers is ok
[7/12/17, 10:11:12 AM] Brian Katz: These are minimum wage workers, they don't are
[7/12/17, 10:11:14 AM] Steve: Nothing great
[7/12/17, 10:11:15 AM] Brian Katz: Care*
[7/12/17, 10:11:53 AM] Steve: That's also it a thing katz
[7/12/17, 10:11:57 AM] Steve: *not
[7/12/17, 10:12:11 AM] Steve: Managers are at these locations for that reason, among others
[7/12/17, 10:12:38 AM] Brian Katz: Managers aren't the ones making the food I assume
[7/12/17, 10:13:04 AM] Steve: They are around the food prep, cooking and delivery
[7/12/17, 10:13:14 AM] Steve: At least decent/good managers
[7/12/17, 10:13:36 AM] Steve: That's a major part of their job
[7/12/17, 10:13:50 AM] Steve: I worked in the industry on all levels
[7/12/17, 10:13:53 AM] Brian Katz: Managers aren't like saurons eye bro, I'm sure they miss a lot.
[7/12/17, 10:13:54 AM] Steve: Just trust
[7/12/17, 10:14:06 AM] Steve: They miss stuff as any manager of any company does
[7/12/17, 10:14:15 AM] Steve: But they should still be in top of things
[7/12/17, 10:14:37 AM] Steve: And missing "some things" doesn't cause a company wide e.coli outbreak
[7/12/17, 10:14:38 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah "should" be, probably not as much as you think
[7/12/17, 10:14:42 AM] Steve: That's just not caring
[7/12/17, 10:15:06 AM] Steve: Again, I worked in the industry for 7 years and understand their are bad managers as well as bad employees
[7/12/17, 10:15:14 AM] Steve: Most want to do their job well and correctly
[7/12/17, 10:15:20 AM] Brian Katz: That's probably tainted meat that they bought, and is that on the franchise? Or on the food distributer
[7/12/17, 10:15:22 AM] Steve: To assume none of them care is ignorant
[7/12/17, 10:15:38 AM] Steve: How do you even know that?
[7/12/17, 10:15:48 AM] Steve: Nothing about that outbreak suggested that
[7/12/17, 10:15:53 AM] Steve: That's just you assuming
[7/12/17, 10:16:42 AM] Brian Katz: I'm sorry, I just realized I don't care about this.
[7/12/17, 10:16:57 AM] Steve: A lot of banter for not caring
[7/12/17, 10:17:11 AM] Steve: Weird ü§î
[7/12/17, 10:37:23 AM] Steve: @16318489683 you going to the game tonight?
[7/12/17, 10:40:34 AM] Donk: so you are knocking chipotle for taking a day to make sure that everyone was up to date on food safety and all of that to try to stop it from happening again and at the same time make it seem like wendys/tacobell/etc are better for not having closed a day to take precautionary steps?
[7/12/17, 10:41:03 AM] Steve: I'm not knocking chipotle
[7/12/17, 10:41:09 AM] Steve: I was just trolling that post
[7/12/17, 10:41:13 AM] Steve: They are equally bad
[7/12/17, 10:41:21 AM] Steve: But apparently you have a personal stake in chipotle
[7/12/17, 10:41:48 AM] Steve: You are not the chipotle fairness üö®üö®üö®üö®üöì
[7/12/17, 10:42:04 AM] Steve: *now
[7/12/17, 10:42:22 AM] Launchpad: I haven't had BK or Jack in the Box in years
[7/12/17, 10:42:22 AM] Launchpad: oh how I miss those tacos
[7/12/17, 10:42:30 AM] Steve: Now if I posted something defending the other food places, then I'd see your point
[7/12/17, 10:43:11 AM] Steve: Stop fishing @19732079889
[7/12/17, 10:43:12 AM] Donk: you did say this
[7/12/17, 10:43:15 AM] Launchpad: In N Out üî•üçîüçü
[7/12/17, 10:43:16 AM] Donk: which is basically defending them
[7/12/17, 10:43:31 AM] Steve: Because I was stating a recent fact?
[7/12/17, 10:43:49 AM] Donk: sure
[7/12/17, 10:43:50 AM] Dan Watts: üî•üî•üî•
[7/12/17, 10:43:50 AM] Steve: Weird way to defend by putting up facts
[7/12/17, 10:44:12 AM] Steve: Don't have those here in NYC
[7/12/17, 10:44:13 AM] Donk: In N Out = most overrated burger place
[7/12/17, 10:44:26 AM] Launchpad: You shut your fucken mouth
[7/12/17, 10:44:27 AM] Donk: they are good
[7/12/17, 10:44:27 AM] Kiyoon: lol @Katz Saurons eye
[7/12/17, 10:44:29 AM] Donk: but not that great
[7/12/17, 10:44:33 AM] Kiyoon: hilarious reference
[7/12/17, 10:44:41 AM] Donk: i like five guys and shake shack more personally
[7/12/17, 10:44:55 AM] Steve: I like shake shack of the three the most also
[7/12/17, 10:45:15 AM] Steve: Five guys is a little too greasy for me
[7/12/17, 10:45:21 AM] Steve: Peanut oil out the ass
[7/12/17, 10:45:43 AM] Launchpad: I haven't had shake shack but 5 guys is def comparable and a tier above BK, Wendys
[7/12/17, 10:45:49 AM] Miller: 100% right donk
[7/12/17, 10:45:53 AM] Launchpad: The Habit is kind of overrated too
[7/12/17, 10:45:56 AM] Dan Watts: I think shake shack is overrated
[7/12/17, 10:46:03 AM] Dan Watts: And overpriced
[7/12/17, 10:46:10 AM] Miller: the only truly awesome things about in n out are the absurdly low prices and the absurdly nice people who work there
[7/12/17, 10:46:15 AM] Steve: They are all overpriced
[7/12/17, 10:46:21 AM] Miller: the food is generic burger and fries, its fine
[7/12/17, 10:46:33 AM] Donk: animal fries are great, but you put cheese and russian dressing on anything its going to be good
[7/12/17, 10:46:33 AM] Steve: we'll shake shack/five guys
[7/12/17, 10:46:39 AM] Steve: In and out no
[7/12/17, 10:47:30 AM] Launchpad: In N Outs fries are so/so, but their burgers are perfect beefy cheesy melt
[7/12/17, 10:47:48 AM] Launchpad: five guys has the best (cajun) fries
[7/12/17, 10:47:55 AM] Donk: shake shacks best thing is the shack stack that is the burger with the cheese stuff portabello mushroom on top
[7/12/17, 10:48:00 AM] Steve: I also just like burgers cooked from home with my special seasoning
[7/12/17, 10:48:01 AM] Dan Watts: Animal style everything
[7/12/17, 10:48:03 AM] Steve: It's bomb
[7/12/17, 10:53:56 AM] Launchpad: üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ
[7/12/17, 10:54:34 AM] Kiyoon: shake shack pretty overpriced
[7/12/17, 10:55:17 AM] Launchpad: Fuddruckers got the jalapeno cheddar sauce...
[7/12/17, 10:57:27 AM] Donk: i havent been to a fuddruckers in like 15 years
[7/12/17, 10:57:29 AM] Steve: They both are
[7/12/17, 10:57:32 AM] Donk: they still exist?
[7/12/17, 10:58:13 AM] Miller: honestly shake shack/5 guys really not that much more expensive than wendys or BK or w/e
[7/12/17, 10:58:52 AM] Miller: also smashburger is awesome
[7/12/17, 10:59:03 AM] Steve: Want to try wahlburgers
[7/12/17, 10:59:44 AM] Miller: just like every movie mark whalberg has ever been in im sure its awesome
[7/12/17, 11:00:07 AM] Donk: im not the biggest fan of the burgers at smashburger, but i really like their grilled chicken sandwiches
[7/12/17, 11:00:32 AM] Miller: they have a few things that are great, the onion strings, the fresh jalapenos and the smash and buffalo fries are awesome
[7/12/17, 11:07:55 AM] Launchpad: missed out on the chance to throw the whataburger hat into this ring üé©
[7/12/17, 11:08:03 AM] Brian Katz: Why thank you@kiyoon
[7/12/17, 11:08:28 AM] Steve: @16318489683 be better at tagging lol
[7/12/17, 11:08:39 AM] Brian Katz: There's no game tonight steve

[7/12/17, 11:13:09 AM] Kiyoon: WHO IS LEISHA
[7/12/17, 11:13:17 AM] Steve: My lady friend
[7/12/17, 11:13:27 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/12/17, 11:14:06 AM] Kiyoon: someone send the breaking news pic
[7/12/17, 11:14:16 AM] Steve: It's not breaking
[7/12/17, 11:14:17 AM] Brian Katz: I'm not jealous at all, and I'm not in west bumble fuck, it's east dummy.
[7/12/17, 11:14:24 AM] Steve: Everyone from New York knows
[7/12/17, 11:14:30 AM] Miller: yea queens is actually west long island
[7/12/17, 11:14:37 AM] Steve: Sorry, East bumble fuck
[7/12/17, 11:14:40 AM] Brian Katz: Thank you miller
[7/12/17, 11:14:54 AM] Steve: #fakenews
[7/12/17, 11:15:00 AM] Steve: #alternativefacts
[7/12/17, 11:15:08 AM] Miller: depends which way you hold the map
[7/12/17, 11:15:22 AM] Steve: You hold maps?
[7/12/17, 11:15:26 AM] Steve: That's not a thing anymore
[7/12/17, 11:15:46 AM] Donk: portrait or landscape
[7/12/17, 11:17:33 AM] Brian Katz: If you use your phone as a map it's still a physical thing you hold steve. So yes you still hold your map foo.
[7/12/17, 11:18:10 AM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[7/12/17, 11:18:41 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[7/12/17, 11:20:21 AM] Steve: You are holding your phone which contain maps
[7/12/17, 11:20:28 AM] Steve: But semantics
[7/12/17, 11:21:42 AM] Launchpad: the borough of Queens is part of the City of New York, yet it resides on the geographic entity known as Long Island
[7/12/17, 11:21:47 AM] Launchpad: But semantics
[7/12/17, 11:22:53 AM] Steve: I've always agreed that queens is geographically in Long Island
[7/12/17, 11:23:00 AM] Steve: I just disagree that queens is Long Island
[7/12/17, 11:23:37 AM] Steve: Two different points
[7/12/17, 11:24:38 AM] Steve: Queens is def attached to Long Island
[7/12/17, 11:24:44 AM] Steve: Those are two different places
[7/12/17, 11:37:02 AM] Brian Katz: On Saturday it took me 45 minutes to go from Long Island city by the ferry, to my house in lake ronkonkoma which is 50 miles away(with no traffic). It takes you probably about the same time to get to you job in Manhattan from queens. The city sucks is my point lol.
[7/12/17, 11:37:44 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/12/17, 11:50:24 AM] Steve: The MTA def sucks
[7/12/17, 11:50:51 AM] Steve: The city is fine
[7/12/17, 11:51:39 AM] Donk: apparantly nj transit/amtrack/lirr are in the "summer of hell" right now
[7/12/17, 11:51:53 AM] Donk: they are repairing a shit ton of tracks at penn station that is making things miserable, at least so ive heard
[7/12/17, 11:52:16 AM] Dan Watts: supposedly its going to turn into the fall and winter of hell as well
[7/12/17, 11:52:41 AM] Donk: yeah, im glad i dont have to deal with any of that
[7/12/17, 11:52:56 AM] Dan Watts: driving is brutal
[7/12/17, 11:53:19 AM] Donk: i drive the opposite way of traffic both ways every day, its ok for me
[7/12/17, 11:53:19 AM] Dan Watts: but since school has been out for summer the traffic has been significantly lighter
[7/12/17, 11:53:33 AM] Brian Katz: Not to jinx myself, but I haven't been effected by it yet
[7/12/17, 11:53:55 AM] Donk: yeah, summer always way better for traffic, its a nice bonus
[7/12/17, 11:54:52 AM] Brian Katz: I'm just not a fan of the city. Too many people trying to do the same thing everyone else is at all times.
[7/12/17, 11:55:23 AM] Miller: the best part is they are only fixing amtrak shit
[7/12/17, 11:55:29 AM] Miller: so they fuck over the LIRR for 2 months
[7/12/17, 11:55:33 AM] Miller: and dont fix 1 goddam thing
[7/12/17, 11:55:45 AM] Brian Katz: Have been effected miller?
[7/12/17, 11:55:56 AM] Miller: yea my usual morning train now goes to atlantic terminal
[7/12/17, 11:56:02 AM] Brian Katz: That's lame
[7/12/17, 11:56:06 AM] Miller: and my usual coming home train now has to transfer at westbury
[7/12/17, 11:56:15 AM] Brian Katz: That also sucks
[7/12/17, 11:56:23 AM] Brian Katz: You're out of Hicksville right?
[7/12/17, 11:56:30 AM] Miller: im leaving from bethpage now
[7/12/17, 11:57:30 AM] Brian Katz: Go back to Hicksville, it's not effected as much because it's a way bigger station. I'm not effected at all from ronkonkoma because of that reason
[7/12/17, 11:59:08 AM] Miller: theres no morning train i can take that i can get a nice seat on
[7/12/17, 11:59:17 AM] Miller: im very picky about my AM seat
[7/12/17, 12:00:02 PM] Brian Katz: Better than going to Atlantic terminal
[7/12/17, 12:01:16 PM] Miller: i dont, thats why i stopped leaving from hicksville and started leaving from bethpage
[7/12/17, 12:02:51 PM] Brian Katz: Oh you were getting that out of Hicksville?
[7/12/17, 12:03:15 PM] Miller: correct
[7/12/17, 12:03:37 PM] Miller: MTA took away the one good thing i had in my life, the 625 train
[7/12/17, 12:05:24 PM] Brian Katz: Ouch
[7/12/17, 12:08:26 PM] Scott: Off to go get religiously divorced.
[7/12/17, 12:09:26 PM] Miller: get em!
[7/12/17, 12:09:40 PM] Brian Katz: In the eyes of the Jews?
[7/12/17, 12:09:48 PM] Scott: This will be interesting.
[7/12/17, 12:10:49 PM] Steve: We need video of this
[7/12/17, 12:10:52 PM] Donk: you should have refused a get, and then she could have sent some muscled super jews out to rough you up until you relented
[7/12/17, 12:10:55 PM] Steve: Wear a go pro
[7/12/17, 12:11:19 PM] Scott: Yeah great idea
[7/12/17, 12:11:26 PM] Scott: Then I'm subject to punitive damages
[7/12/17, 12:12:15 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/12/17, 12:12:30 PM] Steve: She can sue you for recording your own ridicule?
[7/12/17, 12:12:38 PM] Steve: Thank god I'm not Jewish
[7/12/17, 12:12:43 PM] Scott: No
[7/12/17, 12:12:48 PM] Scott: For refusing this
[7/12/17, 12:13:01 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[7/12/17, 12:13:02 PM] Donk: oh, i thought you meant that she was going to sue because she had you beaten up
[7/12/17, 12:13:10 PM] Donk: which still made no sense
[7/12/17, 12:13:13 PM] Launchpad: We thank him for that too
[7/12/17, 12:13:36 PM] Steve: Oh, don't refuse it just record it
[7/12/17, 12:14:05 PM] Steve: Do you though?
[7/12/17, 12:14:51 PM] Steve: Makes very little sense especially since I fit the mold of your hard work pays off model
[7/12/17, 12:15:01 PM] Steve: Would think you would use me as an example
[7/12/17, 12:15:22 PM] Steve: Which I'm also thankful that you can't
[7/12/17, 12:15:41 PM] Launchpad: like I said a million times you have to work hard at being smart, not just work hard
[7/12/17, 12:15:51 PM] Steve: I do that as well
[7/12/17, 12:15:52 PM] Launchpad: you just work hard at getting dumber and dumber
[7/12/17, 12:15:55 PM] Miller: You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America?
[7/12/17, 12:15:55 PM] Steve: And you haven't said that ever
[7/12/17, 12:15:56 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/12/17, 12:15:59 PM] Steve: Like never
[7/12/17, 12:16:06 PM] Steve: Sorry, this was the first time
[7/12/17, 12:16:17 PM] Launchpad: don't even know how maps work anymore
[7/12/17, 12:16:21 PM] Steve: How exactly do I do that?
[7/12/17, 12:16:26 PM] Steve: I do
[7/12/17, 12:16:38 PM] Steve: I just don't think Long Island and queens are the same place
[7/12/17, 12:16:44 PM] Steve: Which in a map I'm proven right
[7/12/17, 12:16:50 PM] Steve: Never said they weren't attached
[7/12/17, 12:17:08 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/jul/06/sorry-jay-z-saying-that-jews-own-all-property-in-america-is-antisemitic
[7/12/17, 12:17:09 PM] Brian Katz: Where is Queens located steve?
[7/12/17, 12:17:21 PM] Steve: Again, you are the idiot, along with donk, who believes land masses that are attached are the same place.
[7/12/17, 12:17:26 PM] Steve: Which they arent
[7/12/17, 12:17:31 PM] Dan Watts: pretty sure it can be laughed off as a compliment
[7/12/17, 12:18:01 PM] Steve: It's located in queens
[7/12/17, 12:18:02 PM] Miller: yea jews are very sensitive about everything so im not surprised about the backlash
[7/12/17, 12:18:12 PM] Launchpad: and this
[7/12/17, 12:18:13 PM] Miller: but it was a compliment/blueprint to follow more than anything else
[7/12/17, 12:18:55 PM] Steve: That using google maps on your phone is the same as holding an actual map?
[7/12/17, 12:19:04 PM] Steve: Yea, and I'm the idiot.
[7/12/17, 12:19:21 PM] Brian Katz: It is holding a map buddy lol
[7/12/17, 12:19:25 PM] Donk: yeah i wouldnt say its antisemetic
[7/12/17, 12:19:30 PM] Donk: but its def a stereotype
[7/12/17, 12:19:37 PM] Steve: It's holding your phone that contains google maps
[7/12/17, 12:19:42 PM] Steve: Still not holding an actual map
[7/12/17, 12:19:53 PM] Donk: and even positive stereotypes can have a negative impact
[7/12/17, 12:19:58 PM] Brian Katz: Of course it's holding an actual map
[7/12/17, 12:20:09 PM] Brian Katz: It's a map you're looking at
[7/12/17, 12:20:14 PM] Miller: agreed
[7/12/17, 12:20:18 PM] Brian Katz: What's the app called steve?
[7/12/17, 12:20:21 PM] Steve: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/12/17, 12:20:47 PM] Donk: its also not the first time Jay has done this, he loves talking about his jew lawyers
[7/12/17, 12:21:07 PM] Miller: i remember once before
[7/12/17, 12:21:13 PM] Brian Katz: You've proved you're self wrong, that's a map on a phone, which is still a map foo
[7/12/17, 12:21:17 PM] Steve: 99 problems?
[7/12/17, 12:21:21 PM] Scott: So this is weird...im in a via rideshare on the way and they literally just drove past where she works.
[7/12/17, 12:21:25 PM] Steve: It's actually just a map
[7/12/17, 12:21:33 PM] Brian Katz: You're correct
[7/12/17, 12:21:36 PM] Brian Katz: On a phone
[7/12/17, 12:21:39 PM] Steve: Nope
[7/12/17, 12:21:41 PM] Miller: Had to get some chollah bread so you can holla back, and holla that / My Jewish lawyer too enjoyed the fruit of letting my cash stack.‚Äù
[7/12/17, 12:21:42 PM] Steve: It's just a map
[7/12/17, 12:21:52 PM] Brian Katz: Correct
[7/12/17, 12:21:55 PM] Launchpad: Jay-Z: "Save Money, Invest"
World: "Genius!"
Scott: "Save Money, Invest"
New Group: "Privileged, entitled, cheap"
[7/12/17, 12:22:08 PM] Brian Katz: Are you holding it when you look at it?
[7/12/17, 12:22:25 PM] Donk: maybe is just once, not sure
[7/12/17, 12:24:20 PM] Miller: im sure my grandma is pissed
[7/12/17, 12:26:10 PM] Donk: maybe i keep thinking of this line, which im not really sure what it means since martha stewart isnt jewish: The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish/Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
[7/12/17, 12:27:25 PM] Launchpad: white female goys can be successful too donk, thats what it means
[7/12/17, 12:27:55 PM] Donk: it implies that he is like martha stewart, but not jewish
[7/12/17, 12:27:57 PM] Donk: but neither is martha
[7/12/17, 12:28:40 PM] Launchpad: Jay-Z the the Martha Stewart of rap music
[7/12/17, 12:32:57 PM] Scott: Going in. This is nuts.
[7/12/17, 12:33:27 PM] Scott: Waiting in waiting room.
[7/12/17, 12:35:07 PM] Brian Katz: You can do it cheese!! You can get divorced under Jewish law all night long!!!
[7/12/17, 12:35:39 PM] Steve: You bring the sheet with the hole in it?
[7/12/17, 12:36:22 PM] Scott: Poor taste.
[7/12/17, 12:36:50 PM] Steve: So it wasn't poor taste when we said the same thing tonyou saturday?
[7/12/17, 12:36:53 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/12/17, 12:36:59 PM] Steve: GTFO
[7/12/17, 12:37:03 PM] Scott: I'm in the moment. This isn't thrilling.
[7/12/17, 12:37:07 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/12/17, 12:37:28 PM] Scott: I'm in some like weird floor of this building waiting to voluntarily get shamed
[7/12/17, 12:37:31 PM] Scott: Thrilling truly
[7/12/17, 12:37:34 PM] Dan Watts: you're not even that jewish
[7/12/17, 12:37:37 PM] Dan Watts: why are you doing this
[7/12/17, 12:37:39 PM] Scott: It's not for me
[7/12/17, 12:37:41 PM] Scott: It's for her
[7/12/17, 12:37:45 PM] Scott: U have to under Jewish law
[7/12/17, 12:37:53 PM] Scott: When u get religiously married to get a divorce
[7/12/17, 12:37:58 PM] Brian Katz: It's not like there's a group of rabbis shaking their heads at you in disappointment is there?
[7/12/17, 12:38:04 PM] Donk: have to under orthodox law
[7/12/17, 12:38:06 PM] Scott: And by American law it's a barrier to divorce completion. My only barrier.
[7/12/17, 12:38:14 PM] Donk: no conserative or reform jew is going for a get
[7/12/17, 12:38:16 PM] Scott: And all barriers have to be removed
[7/12/17, 12:38:24 PM] Scott: Kara is orthodox
[7/12/17, 12:38:37 PM] Donk: i know, i just wanted to clarify because you made it seem like all jews
[7/12/17, 12:38:38 PM] Scott: I'm a moron I shouldn't have married Jewish but I did.
[7/12/17, 12:38:46 PM] Donk: but its only the super jews
[7/12/17, 12:38:47 PM] Miller: is this similar to sharia law or na? @17189742074 ?
[7/12/17, 12:38:48 PM] Steve: Cheese waiting in a waiting room to get straight shredded. There's vomit on his sweater, moms spaghetti.
[7/12/17, 12:38:55 PM] Dan Watts: lmao
[7/12/17, 12:39:27 PM] Brian Katz: Lol, damn 8 mile
[7/12/17, 12:39:35 PM] Dan Watts: under sharia a muslim man can marry 4 women, even non-muslims so long as she converts but a muslim woman can only marry 1 man and has to be pure muslim
[7/12/17, 12:39:38 PM] Launchpad: can you explain I'm a shitty jew
[7/12/17, 12:39:42 PM] Miller: best way to marry a jewish woman is to marry a non jewish woman and have her convert
[7/12/17, 12:39:52 PM] Brian Katz: Glass half full cheese, one step closer to this all being over
[7/12/17, 12:39:58 PM] Scott: That's true
[7/12/17, 12:40:01 PM] Steve: Or just don't marry a Jewish woman?
[7/12/17, 12:40:02 PM] Launchpad: the best way is not at all
[7/12/17, 12:40:03 PM] Donk: or marry the right jewish woman
[7/12/17, 12:40:12 PM] Scott: Can file the divorce papers next week once this is done
[7/12/17, 12:40:20 PM] Scott: I'm not marrying a Jewish woman if I can avoid it
[7/12/17, 12:40:22 PM] Steve: #facts
[7/12/17, 12:40:22 PM] Miller: gal gadot jewish? i would marry her
[7/12/17, 12:40:27 PM] Scott: At this point as shitty as that sounds
[7/12/17, 12:40:33 PM] Miller: is tara jewish?
[7/12/17, 12:40:35 PM] Donk: explain what? the different demoniations of Judaism? or a get?
[7/12/17, 12:40:36 PM] Steve: I think she's Eastern European
[7/12/17, 12:40:39 PM] Launchpad: I would marry gal gadot
[7/12/17, 12:40:42 PM] Scott: Taryn is not
[7/12/17, 12:40:45 PM] Miller: not a religion
[7/12/17, 12:40:52 PM] Scott: Fuck the scribe is here now
[7/12/17, 12:40:52 PM] Launchpad: considering shes gonna make $50 million on the next 2 wonder woman movies
[7/12/17, 12:40:52 PM] Miller: as most jews are eastern european
[7/12/17, 12:40:57 PM] Scott: Black hat as fuck
[7/12/17, 12:41:07 PM] Steve: I realize that isn't a religion
[7/12/17, 12:41:14 PM] Steve: Just trying to narrow down where she's from
[7/12/17, 12:41:21 PM] Steve: Give us a better answer
[7/12/17, 12:41:32 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[7/12/17, 12:41:32 PM] Launchpad: Israel
[7/12/17, 12:41:41 PM] Steve: She's Israeli
[7/12/17, 12:41:53 PM] Steve: I was off
[7/12/17, 12:42:06 PM] Miller: wait you talking about gal gadot or cheeses GF?
[7/12/17, 12:42:13 PM] Steve: Gal gadot
[7/12/17, 12:42:16 PM] Donk: being israeli is like being american
[7/12/17, 12:42:20 PM] Miller: bc i knew gal gadot was israeli, hence why i asked if she was jewish
[7/12/17, 12:42:26 PM] Steve: Don't care what cheeses girl is
[7/12/17, 12:42:27 PM] Donk: they are majority transplant
[7/12/17, 12:42:42 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[7/12/17, 12:42:49 PM] Steve: Wiki doesn't exactly tell us people religion
[7/12/17, 12:43:00 PM] Steve: If I ever meet her I'll be sure to ask
[7/12/17, 12:43:02 PM] Scott: Taryn isn't my gf
[7/12/17, 12:43:09 PM] Scott: And she is Catholic italian
[7/12/17, 12:43:22 PM] Miller: Gadot's maternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors.[12][13] Her ancestry is Polish-Jewish, Austrian-Jewish, German-Jewish, and Czech-Jewish.[14]i
[7/12/17, 12:43:25 PM] Steve: Oh that's right, cheese is going on a date with a chic that was set up by Allie
[7/12/17, 12:43:26 PM] Miller: it kind of does actually
[7/12/17, 12:43:32 PM] Donk: haha
[7/12/17, 12:43:34 PM] Steve: So apparently that makes taryn not his girl anymore
[7/12/17, 12:43:34 PM] Scott: At some point
[7/12/17, 12:43:37 PM] Scott: Or not
[7/12/17, 12:43:51 PM] Scott: That girl that allie is setting me up with is wishy washy
[7/12/17, 12:43:55 PM] Steve: Even though he was already comparing her to taryn in every way two days ago
[7/12/17, 12:44:08 PM] Steve: Which already dooms the date
[7/12/17, 12:44:08 PM] Scott: I did
[7/12/17, 12:44:20 PM] Miller: to be fair, i would be very wishy washy if someone set me up w/you
[7/12/17, 12:44:31 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[7/12/17, 12:44:49 PM] Steve: Is drake also Jewish?
[7/12/17, 12:44:55 PM] Miller: he is
[7/12/17, 12:44:59 PM] Steve: Damn
[7/12/17, 12:45:05 PM] Steve: Learn something new everyday
[7/12/17, 12:45:11 PM] Scott: One of the rabbis is late
[7/12/17, 12:45:15 PM] Miller: everyone knows theres 3 things jews control
[7/12/17, 12:45:23 PM] Miller: the media, the worlds finances, and the rap game
[7/12/17, 12:45:28 PM] Steve: Typical Jew
[7/12/17, 12:45:48 PM] Miller: im never late
[7/12/17, 12:45:56 PM] Launchpad: and the bagels
[7/12/17, 12:45:59 PM] Steve: Lies
[7/12/17, 12:46:02 PM] Launchpad: 4 things
[7/12/17, 12:46:04 PM] Steve: What about Austin?
[7/12/17, 12:46:08 PM] Miller: one time
[7/12/17, 12:46:17 PM] Miller: and it was your fault for not letting me leave when i wanted to
[7/12/17, 12:46:22 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/12/17, 12:46:25 PM] Steve: Right
[7/12/17, 12:46:28 PM] Steve: Blame the spic
[7/12/17, 12:46:31 PM] Steve: Typical Jew
[7/12/17, 12:46:45 PM] Miller: needed your nappy time
[7/12/17, 12:47:09 PM] Steve: Need I remind you, you alsonnapped
[7/12/17, 12:47:18 PM] Steve: Then decided to go across town for lunch
[7/12/17, 12:47:25 PM] Miller: i took 0 naps all weekend
[7/12/17, 12:47:31 PM] Steve: Because you had to try that place
[7/12/17, 12:47:33 PM] Miller: i did lay down for about 30 min at one point
[7/12/17, 12:47:37 PM] Steve: Then gave us 5 minutes to eat
[7/12/17, 12:47:39 PM] Steve: You napped
[7/12/17, 12:47:44 PM] Steve: Sean was there
[7/12/17, 12:47:54 PM] Miller: i may have napped in the ice box
[7/12/17, 12:48:03 PM] Miller: but that was alcohol induced narcolepsy and its a serious medical condiditon
[7/12/17, 12:48:06 PM] Steve: You also napped that afternoon after the draft
[7/12/17, 12:48:18 PM] Miller: i didnt, i was busy watching clodahgs news reports on robberies
[7/12/17, 12:48:20 PM] Steve: As did I
[7/12/17, 12:48:27 PM] Miller: and listening to sean talk about bbq food
[7/12/17, 12:49:50 PM] Steve: That was the day before
[7/12/17, 12:49:54 PM] Steve: Friday morning
[7/12/17, 12:50:05 PM] Steve: He narrated his BBQ orders for the week
[7/12/17, 12:52:06 PM] Miller: Not a day went by without sean loudly talking about bbq food on speakerphone
[7/12/17, 12:52:19 PM] Steve: At least after Friday he closed the door
[7/12/17, 12:52:24 PM] Steve: I didn't hear him as much
[7/12/17, 12:54:24 PM] Kiyoon: did any of you single folk get laid in Austin
[7/12/17, 12:55:32 PM] Steve: Scottie got a BJ, allegedly
[7/12/17, 12:55:37 PM] Launchpad: i got a late tinder bj from a chubby girl
[7/12/17, 12:55:43 PM] Steve: No one could confirm or deny that
[7/12/17, 12:56:12 PM] Steve: He also successfully creeped out two women on Thursday night also
[7/12/17, 12:56:18 PM] Steve: And sean
[7/12/17, 12:56:31 PM] Donk: so once again only launchpaid got any (sean excluded)?
[7/12/17, 12:56:47 PM] Steve: Facts
[7/12/17, 12:56:47 PM] Launchpad: I was blackout drunk and had no recollection of being in your apt at that hour
[7/12/17, 12:56:48 PM] Miller: I heard a rumor lp also got some in his bathroom sat night
[7/12/17, 12:56:57 PM] Steve: He's a regular Don Juan
[7/12/17, 12:57:14 PM] Steve: Well you were and it happened
[7/12/17, 12:57:32 PM] Steve: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/12/17, 12:57:45 PM] Steve: @15166335046 and @17189742074 also got laid
[7/12/17, 12:57:53 PM] Steve: Here is the photo evidence right before
[7/12/17, 12:59:21 PM] Steve: If you'll notice, the first male is attracting the other male with his butt hole smell (Australian voice)
[7/12/17, 12:59:41 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[7/12/17, 1:00:17 PM] Miller: You got some weird fantasies
[7/12/17, 1:00:30 PM] Kiyoon: cmon steve where you at??
[7/12/17, 1:00:38 PM] Kiyoon: expected beter out of you
[7/12/17, 1:00:58 PM] Steve: I am dating someone exclusively but did pretend like it was 7th grade and made out and grabbed a woman's butt hole
[7/12/17, 1:01:15 PM] Brian Katz: What's beter? And why would you expect that out of steve?
[7/12/17, 1:01:35 PM] Miller: Oh now you're exclusive? Where was the breaking news?
[7/12/17, 1:01:38 PM] Steve: You seem confused
[7/12/17, 1:01:43 PM] Kiyoon: see!
[7/12/17, 1:01:52 PM] Steve: We were already exclusive before the trip
[7/12/17, 1:02:01 PM] Steve: I just didn't feel the need to share
[7/12/17, 1:02:04 PM] Miller: So you just lied to us?
[7/12/17, 1:02:06 PM] Steve: @16102201963 knew
[7/12/17, 1:02:10 PM] Steve: He's my new bff
[7/12/17, 1:02:24 PM] Steve: Well, I have no integrity, so...
[7/12/17, 1:02:37 PM] Miller: Weird thing to lie about
[7/12/17, 1:02:41 PM] Launchpad: Seriously??? wtf is that
[7/12/17, 1:02:48 PM] Launchpad: very weird
[7/12/17, 1:02:49 PM] Steve: I didn't lie I just omitted facts
[7/12/17, 1:02:55 PM] Launchpad: Were so serious I can't tell anyone
[7/12/17, 1:03:03 PM] Steve: I just said I would still hook up with women
[7/12/17, 1:03:06 PM] Miller: No that exact question was asked
[7/12/17, 1:03:09 PM] Launchpad: apparently not that serious if you were grabbing buttholes
[7/12/17, 1:03:11 PM] Steve: Just never told you we were exclusive
[7/12/17, 1:03:14 PM] Miller: You said you weren't exclusive
[7/12/17, 1:03:21 PM] Miller: Like in those exact words
[7/12/17, 1:03:23 PM] Steve: Pull that up and remind me
[7/12/17, 1:03:27 PM] Steve: I don't remember
[7/12/17, 1:03:31 PM] Steve: But it could have happened
[7/12/17, 1:03:31 PM] Miller: It happened in person
[7/12/17, 1:03:35 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/12/17, 1:03:39 PM] Steve: Fake news!
[7/12/17, 1:03:43 PM] Miller: We weren't sitting around texting each other in Austin
[7/12/17, 1:03:44 PM] Steve: Fake fake fake!
[7/12/17, 1:04:02 PM] Steve: I need texting evidence
[7/12/17, 1:04:09 PM] Miller: @15165329107 @17189742074 @16195657200 I'm sure someone else was there
[7/12/17, 1:05:00 PM] Steve: We talked about it the weekend before we left
[7/12/17, 1:05:16 PM] Steve: But I don't remember ever having a conversation about that in person with you guys
[7/12/17, 1:05:26 PM] Steve: In these groups we talked about it
[7/12/17, 1:06:21 PM] Steve: But the WhatsApp convos happened before and actual conversation occurred
[7/12/17, 1:06:29 PM] Steve: So I wasn't lying about exclusivity then
[7/12/17, 1:07:30 PM] Brian Katz: Queens is located on Long Island lol
[7/12/17, 1:07:48 PM] Steve: It's attached
[7/12/17, 1:07:52 PM] Steve: Any other questions?
[7/12/17, 1:08:20 PM] Brian Katz: It wasn't a question, it was a statement
[7/12/17, 1:17:32 PM] Brian Katz: What is this?
[7/12/17, 1:18:23 PM] Launchpad: a beer/music/art/tech festival in SD
[7/12/17, 1:18:32 PM] Launchpad: with celebrity guest DJ
[7/12/17, 1:22:09 PM] Brian Katz: Is it dj hodor?
[7/12/17, 1:22:51 PM] Launchpad: yeah
[7/12/17, 1:23:48 PM] Kiyoon: damnnn jealous
[7/12/17, 1:32:32 PM] Scott: Well that's done.
[7/12/17, 1:33:00 PM] Launchpad: how did that go?
[7/12/17, 1:33:23 PM] Scott: It was interesting to say the least lop
[7/12/17, 1:33:25 PM] Scott: Lol
[7/12/17, 1:33:31 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese is a free man under the eyes of his god
[7/12/17, 1:33:48 PM] Scott: Not until it's delivered to her but it's irrevocable
[7/12/17, 1:33:57 PM] Scott: So I did my part
[7/12/17, 1:34:38 PM] Brian Katz: That movie was dope
[7/12/17, 1:40:38 PM] Scott: So now she's gotta accept this shit which she will file my papers and it's down
[7/12/17, 1:40:40 PM] Scott: Done
[7/12/17, 1:41:58 PM] Steve: Mazel tov!
[7/12/17, 1:42:06 PM] Steve: Did I do that right?
[7/12/17, 1:42:11 PM] Scott: U did
[7/12/17, 1:42:14 PM] Scott: Nice job.
[7/12/17, 2:02:10 PM] Dan Watts: Pretty sure you told us straight up that you weren't exclusive
[7/12/17, 2:02:40 PM] Dan Watts: hence Cintia
[7/12/17, 2:05:57 PM] Steve: Lol @pretty sure
[7/12/17, 2:06:49 PM] Steve: I did not say anything about exclusivity but I did say I was still going to hook up if the opportunity arose
[7/12/17, 2:07:21 PM] Miller: you said you would still hook up b/c you were not exclusive
[7/12/17, 2:07:35 PM] Steve: I don't believe I said that
[7/12/17, 2:07:42 PM] Donk: im sure steve didnt say this just like he didnt say that queens wasnt on long island
[7/12/17, 2:08:47 PM] Steve: Cool I lied about it all
[7/12/17, 2:08:49 PM] Steve: I'm a liar
[7/12/17, 2:08:59 PM] Steve: I just don't give a fuck what you all think
[7/12/17, 2:09:13 PM] Steve: In fact, fuck all of you
[7/12/17, 2:09:15 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/12/17, 2:09:24 PM] Steve: ^just in case you think I'm mad
[7/12/17, 2:09:33 PM] Donk: i thought that fuck all of you was going to be followed by a rage quit
[7/12/17, 2:09:45 PM] Steve: I don't care enough anymore
[7/12/17, 2:09:48 PM] Donk: but then you lol'd lol
[7/12/17, 2:09:49 PM] Steve: Say what you want
[7/12/17, 2:09:57 PM] Steve: Think what you want
[7/12/17, 2:10:06 PM] Steve: Don't give a fuck what any of you think
[7/12/17, 2:10:20 PM] Steve: Also, count me out of the draft trip next year
[7/12/17, 2:10:34 PM] Donk: whoa
[7/12/17, 2:10:36 PM] Steve: Don't want to go on a trip with you schmucks
[7/12/17, 2:10:37 PM] Donk: i thought you werent mad
[7/12/17, 2:10:39 PM] Brian Katz: A different rage quit of sorts
[7/12/17, 2:10:42 PM] Steve: üòò
[7/12/17, 2:10:50 PM] Steve: But enjoy
[7/12/17, 2:10:54 PM] Steve: I'm sure it'll be great
[7/12/17, 2:11:00 PM] Steve: A lot less "lying"
[7/12/17, 2:11:08 PM] Miller: launchpad "i dont remember that happening"
steve "i dont care if you remember or not, it happened"

everyone "steve you said you werent exslusive"
steve "go fuck yourselves"
[7/12/17, 2:11:43 PM] Steve: Right, I'm a liar
[7/12/17, 2:11:49 PM] Steve: We've already established that
[7/12/17, 2:12:19 PM] Miller: if steve isnt coming next yr im voting for chicago üòÇ
[7/12/17, 2:12:28 PM] Steve: Good idea
[7/12/17, 2:12:41 PM] Brian Katz: And watts gets one person closer to an exclusive miller watts trip
[7/12/17, 2:14:02 PM] Justin: @16318489683 üëÜüèªüëÜüèªüî•üî•üî•
[7/12/17, 2:14:10 PM] Miller: nice little couples retreat
[7/12/17, 2:14:12 PM] Miller: all inclusive
[7/12/17, 2:14:26 PM] Donk: maybe bed bath beyond?
[7/12/17, 2:14:30 PM] Donk: dont know if youll have time
[7/12/17, 2:14:33 PM] Brian Katz: Draft trip 2021 sandals resort
[7/12/17, 2:14:38 PM] Justin: Home depth if they have time
[7/12/17, 2:14:43 PM] Justin: Depot*
[7/12/17, 2:14:53 PM] Justin: New Hernaned myself
[7/12/17, 2:15:06 PM] Miller: battling vs donk to see who can butcher the quote worse
[7/12/17, 2:15:19 PM] Brian Katz: New Hernaned? Lol
[7/12/17, 2:15:36 PM] Donk: yeah, but my butchering was first!
[7/12/17, 2:48:54 PM] Sean: I was not there. I'm pretty sure I knew they were exclusive, but still pretty new so it didn't matter. Hence the conversation I had day one of bro code no one discusses what we did in Austin outside of the chat
[7/12/17, 2:49:08 PM] Sean: Everyone agreed
[7/12/17, 2:57:11 PM] Steve: Don't worry sean
[7/12/17, 2:57:12 PM] Steve: I'm a liar
[7/12/17, 2:57:19 PM] Steve: Just easier narrative for them
[7/12/17, 2:57:24 PM] Steve: But I appreciate it
[7/12/17, 3:01:53 PM] Miller: im lazy someone else photoshop a picture of steve on a cross
[7/12/17, 3:04:27 PM] Dan Watts: pretty sure we had a conversation in the kitchen but honestly it doesn't matter to me whatsoever, i think lecia is a certified dime and it's the right move
[7/12/17, 3:19:30 PM] Miller: damn she might jump ahead of shaun king in the watts death pool
[7/12/17, 4:03:11 PM] Donk: On a side note, when does exclusivity matter?
[7/12/17, 4:03:32 PM] Donk: Like how long into being exclusive until its not ok to cheat?
[7/12/17, 4:03:58 PM] Miller: not sure theres a universal answer to that
[7/12/17, 4:04:16 PM] Kiyoon: I think once you're exclusive it's not ok to cheat
[7/12/17, 4:04:39 PM] Donk: i agree with that
[7/12/17, 4:05:35 PM] Miller: cant wait to hear @16195657200 s hot taek on its okay if to cheat if you arent fucking right
[7/12/17, 4:06:44 PM] Donk: if hes not fucking right, is it ok for him to cheat or just his partner?
[7/12/17, 4:38:47 PM] Justin: I get shit to this day for not acknowledging exclusivity and going out on a date the day after exclusivity
[7/12/17, 4:40:24 PM] Brian Katz: Who gave you shit for that?
[7/12/17, 4:52:37 PM] Miller: who even knew it happened?
[7/12/17, 5:49:21 PM] Sean: I mean it's different for everyone. While in Austin I was giving an open relationship a try that didn't end up working out so we stopped, but it all depends on what you got going on in your relationship. Traditionally yes your right once your exclusive all bets are off, but everyone views that differently. Nothing traditional about a man being with another man but I still do it
[7/12/17, 5:50:19 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/12/17, 5:50:28 PM] Donk: thats totally different if you were in an open relationship
[7/12/17, 5:55:20 PM] Launchpad: You clearly don't get how this works.... If you are the one who is bad at sex, you increase your likelihood of getting cheated on or not getting followup business
[7/12/17, 5:55:52 PM] Launchpad: if your bad at sex, you're not the one doing the cheating, you're the one who is grateful you're even getting any
[7/12/17, 5:56:14 PM] Brian Katz: I don't think that's entirely accurate
[7/12/17, 5:56:32 PM] Sean: That's a whole other story
[7/12/17, 5:56:36 PM] Brian Katz: So greatcocksmen never get cheated on?
[7/12/17, 5:58:00 PM] Launchpad: false, that is not the contrapositive
[7/12/17, 6:00:07 PM] Brian Katz: A professional stick man, has never been betrayed?
[7/12/17, 6:01:14 PM] Launchpad: You decrease the likelihood of getting cheated on if you are not bad at sex
[7/12/17, 6:02:03 PM] Launchpad: Mathematically accurate statement ‚úî
[7/12/17, 6:02:08 PM] Brian Katz: What if you're a great guy, with a great job? Is that worth more? Or is it all about the D?
[7/12/17, 6:04:58 PM] Launchpad: Sure -- but my statement does not affirm or deny that either way
[7/12/17, 6:05:34 PM] Brian Katz: What if you're Vladimir Putin and your D is weak? Do you get cheated on?
[7/12/17, 6:06:02 PM] Launchpad: no cause you fear death
[7/12/17, 6:06:15 PM] Launchpad: **wife fears death
[7/12/17, 6:17:46 PM] Justin: Idk there's clearly a counterbalance
[7/12/17, 6:20:31 PM] Justin: If getting good d is that important to ones significant other than clearly sex outweighs other areas of a relationship and increases likelihood of eventual cheating for all kinds of reasons.
[7/12/17, 6:21:45 PM] Launchpad: doesn't necessarily mean it outweighs other areas -- just that its important.  But to pretend that its not important at all you're deluding yourself
[7/12/17, 6:26:57 PM] Miller: Lol well he didn't disappoint
[7/12/17, 6:27:06 PM] Launchpad: **to most
[7/12/17, 6:27:15 PM] Launchpad: there are actually some people who don't care about sex
[7/12/17, 6:27:20 PM] Launchpad: they are called asexual
[7/12/17, 6:27:26 PM] Launchpad: this is common sense
[7/12/17, 6:28:26 PM] Miller: Of course it is
[7/12/17, 6:28:50 PM] Miller: If you are 3 standard deviations bad at sex then you're 2.7x more likely to be cheated on, everyone knows that
[7/12/17, 6:30:05 PM] Scott: My dad's friend is asexual it's weird. But a thing apparently
[7/12/17, 6:30:18 PM] Miller: Other things that increase the likelihood of being cheated on include being an asshole, being poor, being unattractive, being abusive, dating thots
[7/12/17, 6:30:50 PM] Miller: But you need to use Launchpads proprietary formula to figure out how much each category matters
[7/12/17, 6:33:28 PM] Scott: Hereinafter referred to as the lp theorum
[7/12/17, 6:34:35 PM] Launchpad: I agree
[7/12/17, 6:34:44 PM] Miller: It's simple really you enter your height weight attractiveness iq net worth and partner sexual history into a spreadsheet and it calculates the odds of you being cheated on
[7/12/17, 6:34:48 PM] Launchpad: except I never told you how much each thing matters
[7/12/17, 6:34:50 PM] Launchpad: just that it does
[7/12/17, 6:35:02 PM] Miller: Frankly I'm shocked he isn't teaching grad students
[7/12/17, 6:35:12 PM] Launchpad: I never said there was a formula, I never said everyone is the same
[7/12/17, 6:35:24 PM] Launchpad: the only thing I said is sex matters
[7/12/17, 6:35:29 PM] Miller: No, what you did say was literally nothing
[7/12/17, 6:35:35 PM] Launchpad: really not a difficult concept
[7/12/17, 6:35:40 PM] Miller: Completely meaningless throwaway statement
[7/12/17, 6:37:53 PM] Launchpad: yet it still sparks endless outrage
[7/12/17, 6:38:05 PM] Launchpad: Most tables have 4 legs
[7/12/17, 6:38:08 PM] Miller: It's mostly in your delivery and approach
[7/12/17, 6:38:14 PM] Launchpad: so do most chairs
[7/12/17, 6:38:57 PM] Miller: Also the fact that you originally started this back in the day by excusing people cheating if they were unsatisfied sexually
[7/12/17, 6:39:17 PM] Launchpad: I didn't excuse people, I just said it happens
[7/12/17, 6:39:46 PM] Dan Watts: #evolution #matingpreferences
[7/12/17, 6:39:50 PM] Launchpad: but perhaps, maybe I should.  Like if you're a 30 year old man and you cant find the clitoris.....
[7/12/17, 6:41:19 PM] Scott: Is this in a quora discussion you began or read @16195657200
[7/12/17, 6:41:21 PM] Scott: ?
[7/12/17, 6:43:21 PM] Dan Watts: Espys tonight? üëéüèª
[7/12/17, 6:43:35 PM] Launchpad: just a life of fucking
[7/12/17, 6:43:38 PM] Scott: Agreed. Anything I wanna c I'll YouTube or something
[7/12/17, 6:43:51 PM] Scott: Such an @16195657200 comment.
[7/12/17, 6:48:18 PM] Launchpad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7YK4NR2bm4
[7/12/17, 6:48:30 PM] Launchpad: for all those who have yet to find the lil man in the boat

[7/13/17, 12:44:20 AM] Justin: San Diego going hard
[7/13/17, 6:12:36 AM] Brian Katz: Are you reading whore magazine herman? The magazine written by, and for whores?
[7/13/17, 7:00:31 AM] Miller: üòÇ
[7/13/17, 12:29:49 PM] Steve: Cubs get Quintana
[7/13/17, 12:35:53 PM] Brian Katz: God he looks ghoulish
[7/13/17, 12:36:16 PM] Steve: Apparently he is using these creams that donthag to his skin
[7/13/17, 12:36:57 PM] Steve: http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4642952
[7/13/17, 12:42:36 PM] Brian Katz: Ghastly
[7/13/17, 1:39:15 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/13/17, 1:47:44 PM] Dan Watts: mcgregor was hanging out with drizzy last night. that plus the shaun king hate make a $50 on conor an easy call
[7/13/17, 1:48:32 PM] Miller: you wanna really win some $ put that $50 on mcgergor by decision @ like 50-1
[7/13/17, 1:48:38 PM] Miller: (dont do that)
[7/13/17, 1:49:16 PM] Dan Watts: https://twitter.com/mrmedina/status/885532174526685184
[7/13/17, 1:51:09 PM] Donk: i dont think that mcgregor has much of a chance but would be so great if he won
[7/13/17, 1:51:22 PM] Donk: i cant imagine many people are rooting for floyd unless they bet on him
[7/13/17, 1:51:31 PM] Donk: (which is probalby the story of every single one of his fights)
[7/13/17, 1:51:34 PM] Brian Katz: I'd be shocked
[7/13/17, 1:52:39 PM] Miller: yea realistically he has no shot, hes actually massively overpriced at -700 IMO
[7/13/17, 1:52:46 PM] Miller: sorry +700
[7/13/17, 1:52:52 PM] Miller: he should be like +2000 in reality
[7/13/17, 2:04:39 PM] Kiyoon: waiting for it to go to +1100 to bet it
[7/13/17, 2:17:59 PM] Justin: Well considering it started at 7 and is now 5 ...
[7/13/17, 2:18:29 PM] Kiyoon: it started at 1100
[7/13/17, 2:18:37 PM] Kiyoon: the opening line was 10-11 to 1
[7/13/17, 2:18:42 PM] Kiyoon: depending on the site
[7/13/17, 2:20:02 PM] Justin: My Vegas sheet opened at 700
[7/13/17, 2:20:16 PM] Justin: But admittedly casinos probably different than online
[7/13/17, 3:30:32 PM] Miller: Today we formally terminated our merger with FanDuel and will withdraw litigation from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This means we will move forward as a separate company, which we believe is the best course in the interest of you - our customers and avid sports fans
[7/13/17, 3:30:34 PM] Miller: damn
[7/13/17, 5:03:12 PM] Donk: too busy trying to get tickets for the phish 13 night run at the garden that starts next week than worry about chance the rapper
[7/13/17, 5:03:50 PM] Miller: how hard can it be to get tickets when there are 13 shows
[7/13/17, 5:04:14 PM] Donk: not really hard at all
[7/13/17, 5:04:22 PM] Donk: more like im trying to score the best deals
[7/13/17, 5:04:39 PM] Dan Watts: soundcloud is in financial ruins, apparently chance is trying to save them
[7/13/17, 5:04:56 PM] Donk: the real question is, how many of the 13 am i going to go to?
[7/13/17, 5:06:03 PM] Miller: if you dont go to 14 are you really a fish head?
[7/13/17, 5:06:15 PM] Donk: its phish with a ph
[7/13/17, 5:06:52 PM] Donk: well i def cant go to at least 1, i think my wife would kill me if i skipped her brothers wedding that i am in
[7/13/17, 5:07:02 PM] Dan Watts: lol league photo?
[7/13/17, 5:07:24 PM] Donk: i think even fish-donk would need glasses, so the photo isnt very accurate
[7/13/17, 5:07:40 PM] Donk: arrogant donk photo rocked two pairs of glasses for extra vision
[7/13/17, 5:14:44 PM] Donk: def better, though you did manage to find a photo of me sweaty as hell after a hike up a mountain
[7/13/17, 5:15:17 PM] Miller: or just wet having come out of the water from doing fish things
[7/13/17, 5:15:18 PM] Miller: either way
[7/13/17, 5:56:33 PM] Scott: Lol
[7/13/17, 5:56:41 PM] Scott: They did well in the draft and this off-season
[7/13/17, 5:56:48 PM] Scott: They have some good young talent
[7/13/17, 5:56:58 PM] Scott: They just never get star talent
[7/13/17, 5:57:17 PM] Brian Katz: They had cousins
[7/13/17, 5:57:27 PM] Scott: Cauley-stein
[7/13/17, 5:57:33 PM] Scott: Labissierie
[7/13/17, 5:57:44 PM] Brian Katz: Are you having a stroke?
[7/13/17, 5:57:53 PM] Brian Katz: What the hell is that?
[7/13/17, 5:57:58 PM] Scott: Two players
[7/13/17, 5:58:21 PM] Brian Katz: I beg to differ
[7/13/17, 5:58:59 PM] Scott: I think they have hield now too
[7/13/17, 5:59:03 PM] Scott: Fox and mason jr
[7/13/17, 5:59:21 PM] Brian Katz: Sounds like a squad, hire that guy stat
[7/13/17, 5:59:41 PM] Scott: Whatever
[7/13/17, 9:08:49 PM] Brian Katz: Woo woo
[7/13/17, 9:23:00 PM] Miller: Big deal Herman could do that
[7/13/17, 9:28:55 PM] Justin: Batting 330. Bet you 100$ he doesn't bat 330 over 50 games?
[7/13/17, 9:29:40 PM] Miller: Bet you 25k he has a higher batting average in the minors than you
[7/13/17, 9:30:16 PM] Justin: Fine you choose a stat
[7/13/17, 9:30:20 PM] Justin: Well extrapolate it
[7/13/17, 9:30:24 PM] Justin: Over 50 games
[7/13/17, 9:31:06 PM] Justin: Glad your so confident
[7/13/17, 9:31:16 PM] Miller: Def uzr
[7/13/17, 9:32:10 PM] Justin: And it's also good to see you equate my bet on literally any statistical category as equivalent to a 25 k automatic win bet
[7/13/17, 9:38:08 PM] Brian Katz: I'd like to bet on hustle herman
[7/13/17, 11:15:16 PM] Justin: #stayingclassy
[7/13/17, 11:16:47 PM] Dan Watts: Oh shitttt
[7/13/17, 11:17:13 PM] Dan Watts: Brewery hopping?
[7/13/17, 11:19:13 PM] Steve: Also think @16195657200 might be sleeping
[7/13/17, 11:20:05 PM] Launchpad: I feel like I'm sleeping
[7/13/17, 11:20:08 PM] Justin: Yeh and I got a chubby chuck Norris smile
[7/13/17, 11:21:04 PM] Justin: Hit up a brewery. A lot of eating just relaxing in his apt now
[7/14/17, 8:00:19 AM] Brian Katz: Ran my first 3k yesterday, and I hit 245. Down 80 lbs
[7/14/17, 8:00:48 AM] Steve: Congrats on both
[7/14/17, 8:00:59 AM] Brian Katz: Thank you bro
[7/14/17, 8:01:02 AM] Steve: How did you feel afterwards and did you stretch
[7/14/17, 8:01:03 AM] Steve: ?
[7/14/17, 8:02:09 AM] Brian Katz: I felt fine, I've been running for the last 2 months. It's been getting easier each time. It's mostly mental. Just got to tell yourself to keep going.
[7/14/17, 8:02:44 AM] Steve: That's what she said?
[7/14/17, 8:03:03 AM] Brian Katz: Just think of baseball lol
[7/14/17, 8:04:08 AM] Steve: well good for you
[7/14/17, 8:04:23 AM] Steve: Where are you going from here?
[7/14/17, 8:04:32 AM] Steve: What distance?
[7/14/17, 8:06:10 AM] Brian Katz: Idk
[7/14/17, 8:06:22 AM] Brian Katz: I'm going to start to work on speed now
[7/14/17, 8:06:32 AM] Brian Katz: Less laps faster
[7/14/17, 8:06:40 AM] Brian Katz: Then build myself back up
[7/14/17, 8:06:44 AM] Steve: Let me know the next one you do and I'll run with you
[7/14/17, 8:07:09 AM] Brian Katz: Sure, if you sign up for one count me in
[7/14/17, 8:08:28 AM] Steve: Sounds good
[7/14/17, 8:08:32 AM] Steve: Congrats again
[7/14/17, 8:13:21 AM] Brian Katz: Damn
[7/14/17, 8:13:24 AM] Brian Katz: Thanks steve
[7/14/17, 8:17:34 AM] Brian Katz: Wait he's alive, fucking Facebook
[7/14/17, 8:18:29 AM] Steve: Lol
[7/14/17, 8:18:42 AM] Steve: Did you just get fake news'd?
[7/14/17, 8:20:17 AM] Scott: Really thought u hated it when ppl said that
[7/14/17, 8:20:37 AM] Steve: When you call actual journalism fake news
[7/14/17, 8:20:44 AM] Steve: Actual fake news is fake news
[7/14/17, 8:20:51 AM] Steve: Like saying someone died when they didn't
[7/14/17, 8:21:02 AM] Steve: That I would also consider fake news
[7/14/17, 8:21:18 AM] Steve: But not calling all mainstream media fake news
[7/14/17, 8:21:35 AM] Steve: You feel me @16102201963?
[7/14/17, 8:25:22 AM] Scott: all the feels
[7/14/17, 8:25:33 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah I got faked news'd
[7/14/17, 9:14:43 AM] Miller: http://people.com/tv/jersey-shore-reunion-series-filming/ REAL NEWS
[7/14/17, 9:17:49 AM] Steve: Also
[7/14/17, 9:18:24 AM] Miller: you cut off the caption
[7/14/17, 9:18:35 AM] Miller: but happy 1 month birthday to her kids
[7/14/17, 9:19:45 AM] Donk: Jwow looks nothing like she used to
[7/14/17, 9:19:54 AM] Miller: nor does snooki
[7/14/17, 9:20:38 AM] Donk: they need to do this reunion to fund more plastic surgery?
[7/14/17, 9:21:29 AM] Miller: snooki looks like she went to the same surgeon as that teen mom chick who did some anal porn
[7/14/17, 9:22:04 AM] Launchpad: They got their assholes bleached at the same place
[7/14/17, 9:22:55 AM] Miller: jwoww going overboard w/fillers or something, she looked good for a minute post-JS
[7/14/17, 9:32:15 AM] Brian Katz: That's j wow?
[7/14/17, 11:28:55 AM] Launchpad: shes pretty fucken hot
[7/14/17, 11:29:23 AM] Launchpad: i mean her
[7/14/17, 11:29:38 AM] Donk: shes made of 72% plastic
[7/14/17, 11:29:50 AM] Dan Watts: #her
[7/14/17, 11:30:00 AM] Launchpad: sign me up
[7/14/17, 11:30:10 AM] Miller: gross
[7/14/17, 11:30:12 AM] Steve: She is the teen mom
[7/14/17, 11:30:17 AM] Steve: That made a porn
[7/14/17, 11:30:19 AM] Steve: Right?
[7/14/17, 11:30:21 AM] Launchpad: and I'm made of 72% water
[7/14/17, 11:30:43 AM] Donk: and yes, she is the porn one
[7/14/17, 11:33:32 AM] Steve: On a baseball note, is Sandoval contract one of the worst in baseball history?
[7/14/17, 11:33:55 AM] Steve: I know pujols/arod/belle are probably top 3 in no particular order
[7/14/17, 11:34:14 AM] Steve: Maybe pujols then arod
[7/14/17, 11:34:26 AM] Donk: arod deal really not that bad
[7/14/17, 11:34:26 AM] Steve: But Sandoval has to be worse than belle at this point
[7/14/17, 11:34:33 AM] Steve: His second one was
[7/14/17, 11:34:34 AM] Donk: there are much worse ones than that
[7/14/17, 11:34:36 AM] Steve: First one not
[7/14/17, 11:34:42 AM] Steve: That bad
[7/14/17, 11:34:43 AM] Donk: its not great, but far from bottom 3 all time
[7/14/17, 11:34:53 AM] Steve: I don't think it's that far
[7/14/17, 11:34:57 AM] Steve: But ok
[7/14/17, 11:35:26 AM] Steve: You were still talking about the arod deal?
[7/14/17, 11:35:31 AM] Donk: yes
[7/14/17, 11:35:31 AM] Steve: Or switched to Sandoval
[7/14/17, 11:35:40 AM] Donk: no, sandoval has been far worse
[7/14/17, 11:36:26 AM] Donk: josh hamiltons deal with the angels was worse
[7/14/17, 11:36:48 AM] Donk: carl pavoano was worse
[7/14/17, 11:41:23 AM] Donk: alot of it comes down to how you evaluate a bad deal. is it just based on dollars, or production relative to contract
[7/14/17, 11:41:49 AM] Donk: pavanos deal wasnt huge like arods, but he did absolutley nothing for the yankees, was hurt the entire time
[7/14/17, 12:00:53 PM] Steve: I think you have to factor in the dollar amount to
[7/14/17, 12:01:08 PM] Steve: For any other franchise the bad arod deal would cripple them
[7/14/17, 12:01:19 PM] Steve: The pavano wouldn't really
[7/14/17, 12:01:27 PM] Steve: It was only 40 mil or so
[7/14/17, 12:01:43 PM] Steve: But it's def dollar amount to the players production
[7/14/17, 12:01:50 PM] Steve: The Hamilton deal was also very bad
[7/14/17, 12:02:05 PM] Steve: Just don't think it was 275 million dollars over 10 years bad
[7/14/17, 12:02:16 PM] Steve: At the age of 31
[7/14/17, 12:02:20 PM] Steve: Same with pujols
[7/14/17, 12:02:32 PM] Steve: Who got like 10/250 I think
[7/14/17, 12:02:35 PM] Steve: At 32
[7/14/17, 12:03:08 PM] Steve: Hamilton did have substance abuse problems
[7/14/17, 12:03:26 PM] Steve: But isn't that any different than arods obvious rampant steroid use?
[7/14/17, 12:21:27 PM] Brian Katz: Worse contract ever Bonilla, will be paying that guy until 2035
[7/14/17, 12:22:07 PM] Miller: cant be the worst contract
[7/14/17, 12:22:20 PM] Miller: b/c its served as a great litmus test for people who understand TVOM and those who dont
[7/14/17, 12:23:00 PM] Donk: so then if the arod deal didnt cripple the yankees financially, then it is no worse than pavanos
[7/14/17, 12:23:03 PM] Donk: it cant be just dollars
[7/14/17, 12:23:12 PM] Donk: otherwise todays deals would always be worse than deals 10 years ago
[7/14/17, 12:23:20 PM] Miller: the ryan howard contract was the worst in baseball
[7/14/17, 12:23:24 PM] Miller: btw i already did this math
[7/14/17, 12:23:25 PM] Miller: like 6mo ago
[7/14/17, 12:23:30 PM] Miller: the best way is just measure $/war
[7/14/17, 12:23:33 PM] Donk: its gotta be dollars in comparison to other contracts at the time plus factoring produciton over the legnth of the contract
[7/14/17, 12:24:10 PM] Miller: btw Pujols also has the option to accept a 10-year, $10 million personal-services contract with the Angels once he retires as an active player
[7/14/17, 12:24:26 PM] Steve: Didn't say it was just dollars
[7/14/17, 12:24:42 PM] Steve: But you also can't just say that dollar aren't as important as performance
[7/14/17, 12:25:06 PM] Brian Katz: Didn't someone super pay Ritchie sexon?
[7/14/17, 12:25:13 PM] Steve: I agree that there are many factors
[7/14/17, 12:25:18 PM] Miller: ryan howard is the worst and its not even close
[7/14/17, 12:25:31 PM] Steve: Did they add Sandoval to that?
[7/14/17, 12:25:31 PM] Miller: he was paid 125m for CUMULATIVE NEGATIVE WAR
[7/14/17, 12:25:36 PM] Steve: It's been pretty bad also
[7/14/17, 12:25:42 PM] Miller: well idk who THEY is b/c i did this
[7/14/17, 12:25:54 PM] Steve: You did that spreadsheet?
[7/14/17, 12:25:59 PM] Miller: i did
[7/14/17, 12:26:00 PM] Steve: I thought you got it from someone else
[7/14/17, 12:26:03 PM] Miller: i do spreadsheets
[7/14/17, 12:26:04 PM] Miller: for everything
[7/14/17, 12:26:05 PM] Steve: Ok well then you
[7/14/17, 12:26:08 PM] Steve: I get that
[7/14/17, 12:26:20 PM] Steve: But I don't automatically assume every spreadsheet you out here is yours
[7/14/17, 12:27:08 PM] Brian Katz: How did the yanks pay for that fat Japanese pitcher?
[7/14/17, 12:27:22 PM] Miller: peanuts
[7/14/17, 12:27:42 PM] Steve: Iraqbu?
[7/14/17, 12:27:46 PM] Steve: *irabu
[7/14/17, 12:27:48 PM] Brian Katz: They paid him in peanuts? But how many pounds?
[7/14/17, 12:27:51 PM] Steve: Aka The fat toad
[7/14/17, 12:27:53 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[7/14/17, 12:28:00 PM] Steve: It was like 3 yes 12 million
[7/14/17, 12:28:11 PM] Steve: Something relatively small
[7/14/17, 12:28:16 PM] Miller: josh hamilton and prince fielder really bad
[7/14/17, 12:28:20 PM] Steve: They paid more for igawa
[7/14/17, 12:28:26 PM] Miller: 3/36 for igawa if i recall
[7/14/17, 12:28:29 PM] Steve: 3yrs 27 mill
[7/14/17, 12:28:35 PM] Miller: but nobody will ever top ryan howard
[7/14/17, 12:28:36 PM] Miller: in MLB history
[7/14/17, 12:28:38 PM] Steve: I think it was 27
[7/14/17, 12:28:46 PM] Miller: they gave a guy who just blew out his achilles a 5/125m extension
[7/14/17, 12:28:52 PM] Steve: But it may have been in the 30's including the posting fee
[7/14/17, 12:30:19 PM] Miller: Yankees placed RHP Michael Pineda on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to July 6, with a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament.
Tommy John surgery has been recommended, although Pineda will receive a second opinion before deciding what to do. It's horrible news for the Yankees and obviously also for Pineda, who is set to hit free agency this winter. If he does go under the knife, he'd be sidelined at least until the second half of 2018 and perhaps until 2019.
[7/14/17, 12:30:39 PM] Miller: maybe get a 2-1 discount w/him and tanaka?
[7/14/17, 12:30:39 PM] Steve: Yea, thatbsucks
[7/14/17, 12:30:46 PM] Miller: or you gonna have an entire rotation of guys w/partially torn UCLs?
[7/14/17, 12:30:49 PM] Steve: But they weren't going to resign him anyway
[7/14/17, 12:30:55 PM] Steve: He was gone after this year
[7/14/17, 12:31:00 PM] Steve: Along with CC
[7/14/17, 12:31:00 PM] Miller: ah didnt realize he was a FA
[7/14/17, 12:31:13 PM] Steve: It says it in the story you just posted
[7/14/17, 12:31:18 PM] Steve: Can we new herman that?
[7/14/17, 12:31:25 PM] Miller: you cannot
[7/14/17, 12:31:29 PM] Miller: not how that works
[7/14/17, 12:31:37 PM] Miller: and i stopped reading after TJ
[7/14/17, 12:31:39 PM] Steve: And also I knew that from a story on espn then other day
[7/14/17, 12:31:55 PM] Steve: About the next 11 games deciding the Yankees season
[7/14/17, 12:31:56 PM] Brian Katz: Our lineup is filthy and young though mi amigo
[7/14/17, 12:32:58 PM] Steve: Our lineup is young and good
[7/14/17, 12:33:06 PM] Steve: Wouldnt say filthy
[7/14/17, 12:33:11 PM] Brian Katz: Filthy
[7/14/17, 12:33:24 PM] Steve: We have lost the last 8 series that we've played
[7/14/17, 12:33:39 PM] Steve: We haven't won a series since we swept @19732079889 Baltimore orioles
[7/14/17, 12:33:46 PM] Brian Katz: Slumps happen
[7/14/17, 12:34:01 PM] Steve: It's been a month of really bad baseball
[7/14/17, 12:34:10 PM] Steve: Luckily we are only 3 1/2 back
[7/14/17, 12:34:23 PM] Steve: But we are young and talented
[7/14/17, 12:34:35 PM] Steve: Still, losing a pitcher to an already thin staff is rough.
[7/14/17, 12:34:45 PM] Brian Katz: Definitely
[7/14/17, 12:37:19 PM] Steve: Montgomery and severino are good building blocks but we need at least two more SP's
[7/14/17, 12:37:28 PM] Steve: Tanaka needs to go under the knife too
[7/14/17, 12:37:34 PM] Steve: He is not the same pitcher

[7/14/17, 1:01:44 PM] Steve: Her and Heidi Klum age very well
[7/14/17, 1:02:13 PM] Miller: And Heidi Klum left Seal, which only prove my point, shit can only be ugly for so long
[7/14/17, 1:02:35 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[7/14/17, 1:03:27 PM] Miller: BREAKING NEWS -- DAL RB Ezekiel Elliott Discipline Looking, Could Include "Short Suspension"
[7/14/17, 1:03:39 PM] Launchpad: so you guys arent into the plastic porn star but are all about J-Lo's guns? weird
[7/14/17, 1:04:02 PM] Miller: yes anyone in the world who prefers farrah abramson to jlo i strongly question your judgement
[7/14/17, 1:04:14 PM] Donk: Agreed
[7/14/17, 1:04:18 PM] Steve: Nice budden line
[7/14/17, 1:04:25 PM] Steve: Broken wings?
[7/14/17, 1:04:32 PM] Miller: no church in the wild
[7/14/17, 1:04:44 PM] Steve: That's not J Lo
[7/14/17, 1:05:02 PM] Steve: That's a chic from Houston who looks exactly like her with her hair up
[7/14/17, 1:05:19 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/14/17, 1:05:26 PM] Miller: damn that really was fake news
[7/14/17, 1:05:28 PM] Miller: i thought it was her
[7/14/17, 1:05:36 PM] Steve: That's why I hashtagged
[7/14/17, 1:05:43 PM] Miller: i also dont care, would smash 100x before i even looked at that plastic surgery abomination
[7/14/17, 1:05:44 PM] Dan Watts: i drunk text j-lo old number so it bounce back
[7/14/17, 1:06:41 PM] Launchpad: i would obviously smash J-Lo...and I am no expert in the trainwreck that is reality tv stars....but based on that ONE pic you posted above, she is fucken smoken hot
[7/14/17, 1:06:58 PM] Launchpad: ok that one she def looks a lot more plasticy
[7/14/17, 1:07:18 PM] Launchpad: big difference in those 2 photos
[7/14/17, 1:07:24 PM] Miller: the one not showing her stupid looking absurdly fake tits is MORE plasticy?
[7/14/17, 1:08:28 PM] Launchpad: Hot...fake tits...whatever
[7/14/17, 1:09:08 PM] Dan Watts: world star did a great photochop
[7/14/17, 1:09:10 PM] Launchpad: and yet she looks plasticy and like she wears too much makeup
[7/14/17, 1:11:29 PM] Launchpad: more like steel
[7/14/17, 1:11:35 PM] Steve: She might have had some minor stuff done but she seems pretty naturally steroidy
[7/14/17, 1:11:47 PM] Miller: hopdoddy!
[7/14/17, 1:11:50 PM] Miller: never made it
[7/14/17, 1:11:58 PM] Miller: yea shes on massive amounts of steroids
[7/14/17, 1:12:10 PM] Miller: and likely in competition form in that photo
[7/14/17, 1:12:14 PM] Dan Watts: maybe she went to drake's fake ab guy
[7/14/17, 1:12:26 PM] Miller: does he also have a fake shoulder guy?
[7/14/17, 1:12:31 PM] Steve: She does doe competitions
[7/14/17, 2:50:02 PM] Launchpad: so I bought my mazda in yesterday to get some work done and they gave me a 2017 loaner
[7/14/17, 2:50:07 PM] Launchpad: and its fucken awesome
[7/14/17, 2:50:21 PM] Launchpad: I may just say fuck the Tesla and get a new Mazda
[7/14/17, 2:50:45 PM] Steve: The new Mazdas are awesome
[7/14/17, 2:51:08 PM] Donk: any update as when they expect to get you the tesla?
[7/14/17, 2:51:12 PM] Launchpad: the entertainment system is top notch

[7/14/17, 2:51:29 PM] Donk: man, your boy musk letting you down
[7/14/17, 2:51:29 PM] Steve: Very similar to the CR-V
[7/14/17, 2:51:34 PM] Steve: But nicer
[7/14/17, 2:51:40 PM] Steve: Yes
[7/14/17, 2:51:50 PM] Steve: It's live mazdas cr-v
[7/14/17, 2:53:00 PM] Launchpad: my plan was always get a 3 or a 3

[7/14/17, 2:53:47 PM] Donk: musk better get to mars soon before everyone starts wanting their deposits back
[7/14/17, 2:53:59 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/14/17, 3:32:15 PM] Miller: She has the cx5
[7/14/17, 3:32:16 PM] Miller: It's nice, a little tight in the front with 2 car seats

[7/14/17, 9:37:58 PM] Justin: Probably took lupe 3 weeks to write that,

[7/14/17, 10:22:56 PM] Miller: What kind of sorcery is this?
[7/14/17, 10:41:01 PM] Miller: Tough loss for the Yankees, walking Hanley intentionally there was stupid imo
[7/15/17, 9:08:33 AM] Steve: Intentional walk wasn't good
[7/15/17, 9:08:47 AM] Steve: But it's same old overthinking girardi
[7/15/17, 9:09:11 AM] Steve: Chapmans control is what bothers me
[7/15/17, 9:09:22 AM] Steve: He hasn't looked 100% either
[7/15/17, 9:09:39 AM] Steve: I think that shoulder still bothers him
[7/15/17, 9:22:47 AM] Brian Katz: My AC blew out and needs to be replaced. Home ownership is always fun lol
[7/15/17, 9:23:11 AM] Scott: Is it a single unit?
[7/15/17, 9:23:24 AM] Scott: Or an entire system ?
[7/15/17, 9:23:59 AM] Steve: Well that's really just ownership of an AC
[7/15/17, 9:24:10 AM] Steve: Is it just the unit?
[7/15/17, 9:25:06 AM] Donk: That sucks,  my washing machine broke this week
[7/15/17, 9:25:11 AM] Donk: Its always something
[7/15/17, 9:25:31 AM] Steve: ^thats def more home ownership
[7/15/17, 9:25:38 AM] Steve: But both suck
[7/15/17, 9:25:44 AM] Scott: Damn arrogant donk always gotta make it about him
[7/15/17, 9:26:16 AM] Steve: I didn't take that as an arrogant donk #hottaek
[7/15/17, 9:26:23 AM] Donk: Ac unit def a home ownership problem too
[7/15/17, 9:26:30 AM] Steve: Too sensitive this morning cheezus
[7/15/17, 9:26:37 AM] Scott: Fair.
[7/15/17, 9:27:09 AM] Steve: If any of our ac's break, even renting a place, we'd have to buy a new one.
[7/15/17, 9:27:13 AM] Steve: That was my only point
[7/15/17, 9:27:27 AM] Donk: I assume he meant a central air ac unti, not a window unit
[7/15/17, 9:27:31 AM] Steve: Washing machine is def more home owner
[7/15/17, 9:27:33 AM] Scott: Depends of its installed in the wall
[7/15/17, 9:27:40 AM] Steve: He's got central air?!
[7/15/17, 9:27:40 AM] Donk: Which is very different
[7/15/17, 9:27:41 AM] Scott: I dunno. Maybe he didn't mean central air
[7/15/17, 9:27:42 AM] Steve: Fancy
[7/15/17, 9:27:44 AM] Steve: I realize
[7/15/17, 9:27:50 AM] Donk: Central air is fancy?
[7/15/17, 9:28:01 AM] Scott: Most ppl don't have it
[7/15/17, 9:28:03 AM] Steve: No @16102201963 that is an arrogant donk comment
[7/15/17, 9:28:08 AM] Donk: Haha
[7/15/17, 9:28:11 AM] Scott: Haha
[7/15/17, 9:28:12 AM] Steve: Mansplaining a central AC unit
[7/15/17, 9:28:33 AM] Donk: For real though,  central air is pretty standard for suburban houses
[7/15/17, 9:28:37 AM] Steve: Entrap AC is def a luxury
[7/15/17, 9:28:43 AM] Steve: *central
[7/15/17, 9:29:07 AM] Steve: Is it?
[7/15/17, 9:29:16 AM] Steve: I felt that it's still a luxury
[7/15/17, 9:29:23 AM] Steve: I'd assume most households don't have it
[7/15/17, 9:29:56 AM] Steve: But I've also gone to a limited amounts of open houses
[7/15/17, 9:30:28 AM] Scott: It's standard now. Isn't in older homes
[7/15/17, 9:30:34 AM] Scott: More standard
[7/15/17, 9:31:30 AM] Donk: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/15/17, 9:31:40 AM] Donk: Thats what the first article i googled said
[7/15/17, 9:32:23 AM] Donk: So, not as many as i would have thought in the northeast, but still substantial.  I think it likely comes down to home age
[7/15/17, 9:33:41 AM] Steve: Hotter climates makes sense
[7/15/17, 9:33:58 AM] Steve: But up here those numbers sound more accurate
[7/15/17, 9:37:20 AM] Miller: I think of the 100 or so houses I looked at when I was buying every one had central air, it wasn't even something I thought about, and those houses were all built in the 50s and 60s
[7/15/17, 9:37:56 AM] Miller: I think the difference is in Queens there's more multifamily homes which obviously doesn't make sense to have
[7/15/17, 9:38:35 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/15/17, 9:38:54 AM] Miller: @16318489683 the compressor needs to be replaced?
[7/15/17, 9:39:06 AM] Steve: I think it's an individual unit
[7/15/17, 9:39:25 AM] Steve: So does that mean I was right, pertaining to this region at least?
[7/15/17, 9:39:56 AM] Scott: @16318489683 we need answers!
[7/15/17, 9:40:04 AM] Steve: He's out
[7/15/17, 9:40:04 AM] Miller: If that's the case, then no offense katz but who cares lol, getting off easy that's like a couple hundred bucks, those compressors are no joke though
[7/15/17, 9:41:45 AM] Miller: I thought my shit broke 2 weeks ago because it stopped making cold air but it was out of coolant and some pipe was frozen? Idk some dude came and fixed it, but it was broken for 2 days when it was crazy hot, holy shit idk how people lived like this back in the day
[7/15/17, 9:43:04 AM] James  L: I have a slow leak in my unit they want 1k to find it and might cost 5k for a new unit so I have to put feeon in every summer
[7/15/17, 9:43:58 AM] Miller: Yea i hope I don't have a leak because I def ran out of that shit earlier than I expected
[7/15/17, 9:44:14 AM] Scott: Is freeon expensive ?
[7/15/17, 9:44:26 AM] James  L: You should never run out of feeon so you def have a leak
[7/15/17, 9:44:31 AM] Miller: Doh
[7/15/17, 9:44:52 AM] Miller: You would think the ac repair guy would tell me these things
[7/15/17, 9:45:01 AM] James  L: Free on is mad expensive now cause it's now an environmental toxin and all the new ac have a different coolant
[7/15/17, 9:45:15 AM] James  L: 50 a gallon
[7/15/17, 9:46:07 AM] James  L: Not making feeon ac units anymore
[7/15/17, 9:47:01 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/15/17, 9:48:52 AM] James  L: Can't all the new systems have specific coolant and pipes asscociated with it your ac and connections are  probably specific to feeon
[7/15/17, 9:49:33 AM] Miller: That's 16 dollar coolant for a car, I wasn't serious lol
[7/15/17, 9:50:19 AM] James  L: Hahah
[7/15/17, 9:52:40 AM] Brian Katz: There's a leak in the unit
[7/15/17, 9:52:53 AM] Brian Katz: Fryon spillong out
[7/15/17, 9:53:29 AM] Miller: So you do have to replace the whole compressor?
[7/15/17, 9:53:42 AM] James  L: Hopefully it's in the system not in the pipes in the house and they need to start ripping out walls and shit
[7/15/17, 9:53:45 AM] Miller: I got fake newsd by the (Spanish) msm
[7/15/17, 9:55:06 AM] Donk: Btw great timing on tge ac breaking yesterday on the coldest day in weeks
[7/15/17, 9:55:29 AM] Donk: Far betrer than a coupke days earlier this week when it was miserably hot
[7/15/17, 9:56:48 AM] Brian Katz: Nah it's the outside unit
[7/15/17, 9:57:17 AM] Miller: That does blow katz, sorry man
[7/15/17, 9:57:30 AM] James  L: Might be an easier fix the outside unit has a lot of aluminum and it's very pour out
[7/15/17, 9:57:30 AM] Steve: well that does suck
[7/15/17, 9:57:43 AM] Steve: And def a homeowners issue
[7/15/17, 9:57:51 AM] Miller: Honestly that saying is totally true, really something always does go wrong first few months
[7/15/17, 9:58:02 AM] Steve: Can one of us go to a trade school and learn how to fix these?
[7/15/17, 9:58:09 AM] Steve: Make it cheaper for all of us
[7/15/17, 9:58:10 AM] Miller: @16316620763?
[7/15/17, 9:58:26 AM] James  L: Still going to hang you out trying to find it looked around avg was 1k to find it
[7/15/17, 9:59:51 AM] James  L: Keeper in the off summer months
[7/15/17, 9:59:59 AM] James  L: Cheaper
[7/15/17, 10:00:12 AM] Donk: Its a tough call. 4 homeowners in the chat, all 4 have central air
[7/15/17, 10:00:28 AM] Steve: One seems to bevy accident lol
[7/15/17, 10:00:36 AM] Steve: *be by
[7/15/17, 10:00:37 AM] Miller: Yea but you can't survive July and August without ac
[7/15/17, 10:00:54 AM] Steve: Stats back me up lol
[7/15/17, 10:42:26 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah, it'll rough for a week or so. What can you do. At least in a week I'll have a brand new AC!!! Glass half full mi amigos
[7/15/17, 10:44:09 AM] Dan Watts: This chick muguruza who won Wimbledon is kinda cute

[7/15/17, 12:48:25 PM] Miller: Checkout the Playstation TV or sling TV (Playstation not required)
[7/15/17, 12:52:44 PM] Dan Watts: Spectrum sucks
[7/15/17, 12:53:08 PM] James  L: What about direct?
[7/15/17, 12:53:39 PM] Dan Watts: It still gets fucked Up in bad weather

[7/15/17, 2:08:42 PM] Launchpad: Appropriating homo culture today. How do I look? Gay? #sdpride
[7/15/17, 2:09:31 PM] Dan Watts: You can't wear that shirt without the white pants bro come on
[7/15/17, 2:09:51 PM] Scott: What is written on it
[7/15/17, 2:11:36 PM] Miller: Seriously can't go to pride without the white pants
[7/15/17, 2:12:05 PM] Scott: Also missing the obligatory tophat
[7/15/17, 5:15:24 PM] James  L: What out for the transgender males into females Scotty don't want to here a story of your lost anal virginity ....
[7/15/17, 5:18:04 PM] Launchpad: Dont worry I sent them your number
[7/15/17, 5:25:13 PM] Miller: Depends if they're pre or post op
[7/15/17, 5:25:32 PM] Scott: Somebody has thought about this before...
[7/15/17, 5:26:16 PM] Miller: Unlike you I posses the ability to analyze things on the fly, it's really not that difficult
[7/15/17, 5:26:53 PM] Scott: Unlike other people we possess the ability to analyze things on the fly...
[7/15/17, 5:26:53 PM] Miller: Think this through, take your time
[7/15/17, 5:27:22 PM] Miller: Fuck it, you can take the üé§ home with you
[7/15/17, 5:27:34 PM] Scott: Thanks.
[7/15/17, 5:27:58 PM] Scott: Awfully thoughtful of u
[7/15/17, 5:31:33 PM] Justin: Cheese definitely isn't ad-libbing his comebacks
[7/16/17, 2:06:54 AM] Brian Katz: Wow
[7/16/17, 2:30:39 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[7/16/17, 10:48:50 AM] Scott: Lol
[7/16/17, 1:02:56 PM] Steve: I do actually
[7/16/17, 1:03:09 PM] Steve: Might just take out half from my savings and out it in there
[7/16/17, 1:09:02 PM] Miller: Literally no downside
[7/16/17, 8:07:30 PM] Scott: Steve thinks he can jump over me with a 6 ft running start
[7/16/17, 8:07:34 PM] Scott: I think not.
[7/16/17, 8:07:44 PM] Scott: Steve says he would use my shoulders as a catapult
[7/16/17, 8:07:50 PM] Sean: That would be impressive
[7/16/17, 8:08:14 PM] Justin: yeh no chance
[7/16/17, 8:08:51 PM] Justin: wouldnt even get steve crotch to face, would mostly just drop kick you to the ground
[7/16/17, 8:10:09 PM] Miller: Either way I'd like to see it
[7/17/17, 10:34:13 AM] Launchpad: Also - there is literally no upside, as it doesn't even beat inflation.  Will take 53.7 years to double your money.
[7/17/17, 10:36:34 AM] Miller: so if you have 100k sitting in checking vs putting it into an online savings account and earnings $1300 is no upside?
[7/17/17, 10:37:09 AM] Miller: since the cost of college is rising like 40% a year guess i shouldnt bother investing my 529, ill never keep up
[7/17/17, 10:37:15 AM] Miller: better to just do nothing
[7/17/17, 10:37:34 AM] Launchpad: Meanwhile, Verizon is paying a 5.3% dividend and it grows every year. Target is paying 4.6%. Abbvie 3.5%
[7/17/17, 10:37:45 AM] Miller: great
[7/17/17, 10:37:51 AM] Miller: and if verizon goes down 20% hows that div looking?
[7/17/17, 10:38:37 AM] Miller: good job, 1st one i looked up verizon is down 18% in the last 12mo
[7/17/17, 10:38:37 AM] Launchpad: as long as its your 'savings' and your holding it long term, it doesn't matter
[7/17/17, 10:38:46 AM] Miller: so ill take my $1300 and you can enjoy losing money
[7/17/17, 10:39:07 AM] Miller: damn only monday and the stupidest thing im gonna see all week
[7/17/17, 10:39:12 AM] Steve: I'll also put my money where I have no chance of losing it
[7/17/17, 10:39:20 AM] Miller: savings and investing are absolutely different concepts
[7/17/17, 10:39:57 AM] Miller: if you arent keeping X% of your $ in risk free liquid account then god bless
[7/17/17, 10:40:27 AM] Launchpad: in 3 years even if the stock price is down 20% Im back even because of the dividend
[7/17/17, 10:40:32 AM] Launchpad: what if it goes up 20%?
[7/17/17, 10:40:37 AM] Launchpad: then Im up a lot more
[7/17/17, 10:40:41 AM] Miller: unless its down another 20% year 2
[7/17/17, 10:40:55 AM] Miller: you can use all the hypotheticals you want
[7/17/17, 10:41:07 AM] Miller: the fact you cannot differentiate b/w investing and a savings account is insane
[7/17/17, 10:41:15 AM] Launchpad: verizon is just one example -- you would be a lot smart to spread it over a basket of dividend aristicrats
[7/17/17, 10:41:23 AM] Launchpad: I know the difference
[7/17/17, 10:41:36 AM] Miller: and yet
[7/17/17, 10:41:49 AM] Launchpad: I would NEVER let 100k sit around in checking account
[7/17/17, 10:42:08 AM] Miller: thats a different decision
[7/17/17, 10:42:24 AM] Miller: and depends on a lot of factors
[7/17/17, 10:42:45 AM] Miller: if you were going to be planning a wedding or buying a house in the next 12 months, you going to be investing that $? good luck with that
[7/17/17, 10:42:53 AM] Miller: goes against every principle of managing money
[7/17/17, 10:43:08 AM] Launchpad: ^^^ this was my caveat
[7/17/17, 10:43:18 AM] Miller: savings doesnt mean long term
[7/17/17, 10:44:00 AM] Miller: well this has been a terrifying conversation, good luck to anyone following the Launchpad Money Management Sytetm‚Ñ¢
[7/17/17, 10:44:40 AM] Launchpad: doesn't mean its short term either.  Its just savings
[7/17/17, 10:44:47 AM] Launchpad: been working for me
[7/17/17, 10:45:36 AM] Steve: You being cheap also probably helps
[7/17/17, 10:45:51 AM] Launchpad: lol
[7/17/17, 10:45:58 AM] Launchpad: do you invest?
[7/17/17, 10:46:51 AM] Launchpad: cause I don't save, I invest.  And I understand some people need someplace to keep money safe without risk.  However, there is also millions of people out there that are afraid of investing because they think its 'too risky'
[7/17/17, 10:47:08 AM] Launchpad: they are sitting on the sidelines because they don't know any better
[7/17/17, 10:48:08 AM] Launchpad: So if you ever plan on retiring, it wont happen because you saved money, it will happen because you invest money
[7/17/17, 10:55:21 AM] Donk: https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimderogatis/parents-told-police-r-kelly-is-keeping-women-in-a-cult?bftw&utm_term=.bl9xbXby5V#.ljVX7P75zL
[7/17/17, 10:55:39 AM] Donk: too many potential trapped in the closet jokes here to even list
[7/17/17, 11:13:36 AM] Launchpad: pretty crazy story
[7/17/17, 11:19:17 AM] Launchpad: Bumble copying Tinder http://blog.bumble.com/superswipe/
[7/17/17, 11:27:20 AM] Donk: i watched friends from college over the weekend (its only 8 half hour episodes)
[7/17/17, 11:27:38 AM] Donk: it was funny, if not a particularly great show
[7/17/17, 11:28:07 AM] Launchpad: Ill watch it
[7/17/17, 11:29:15 AM] Donk: basically all of the characters are assholes who act like 5 year olds, but i did want to keep watching more when it was over, so there is that
[7/17/17, 11:29:41 AM] Launchpad: Like us?
[7/17/17, 11:30:08 AM] Donk: ha, no, i would say that overall, we are much better people, with more redeeming qualities
[7/17/17, 11:32:37 AM] Miller: reviews were awful
[7/17/17, 11:32:58 AM] Miller: all of them mentioned how unlikable they all were
[7/17/17, 11:39:03 AM] Launchpad: Its always sunny crew is also pretty aweful and unlikable
[7/17/17, 11:39:21 AM] Launchpad: sounds like they are unlikable in a different way
[7/17/17, 11:39:38 AM] Donk: very different
[7/17/17, 12:11:03 PM] Justin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiIla9Mqo1I
[7/17/17, 12:11:06 PM] Justin: huey was right
[7/17/17, 12:11:49 PM] Justin: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/report-r-kelly-leads-cult-brainwashes-young-women-w492645
[7/17/17, 12:15:17 PM] Steve: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/17/17, 12:15:28 PM] Donk: damn, i should have been first on that, but it took me so long to find it in my phone, its been a while since anyone new launchpad'd
[7/17/17, 12:29:28 PM] Launchpad: damn
[7/17/17, 12:29:33 PM] Launchpad: recursive new herman loop
[7/17/17, 12:29:55 PM] Launchpad: you're going cause a stack overflow and break the chat
[7/17/17, 12:31:54 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/style/jon-snow-apos-father-rhaegar-064705383.html
[7/17/17, 12:32:31 PM] Launchpad: wrong chat room
[7/17/17, 12:32:47 PM] Justin: is there a got only chat room
[7/17/17, 12:33:15 PM] Launchpad: @19732079889
[7/17/17, 12:34:11 PM] Donk: there is but i dont kow if you can add someone
[7/17/17, 12:34:31 PM] Donk: kiyoon is the group admin i think after feinberg left it
[7/17/17, 12:34:42 PM] Justin: can you still give book spoilers?
[7/17/17, 12:34:49 PM] Donk: no
[7/17/17, 12:34:51 PM] Donk: show is past the book
[7/17/17, 12:35:04 PM] Donk: and if anyone isnt caught up by now, its on them
[7/17/17, 12:35:06 PM] Justin: figured its past but figured some parts might be behind still
[7/17/17, 12:35:09 PM] Miller: Premiere was underwhelming coming off that finale
[7/17/17, 12:35:10 PM] Donk: i just wouldnt spoil this season
[7/17/17, 12:35:20 PM] Donk: it was a table setting episode
[7/17/17, 12:35:27 PM] Justin: i liked the opening
[7/17/17, 12:35:33 PM] Justin: but i agree it went downhill from there
[7/17/17, 12:35:46 PM] Miller: Also I don't really care who Jon snows dad is, I know book nerds all excited
[7/17/17, 12:35:55 PM] Donk: ha
[7/17/17, 12:36:31 PM] Donk: its a detail that didnt translate to the show as much
[7/17/17, 12:36:33 PM] Justin: just itneresting to note hes technically the true heir to throne
[7/17/17, 12:36:42 PM] Donk: alot more of made it is in the books than the show
[7/17/17, 12:37:32 PM] Donk: well, he was born out of wedlock, and never recongized by his father as a heir
[7/17/17, 12:38:04 PM] Donk: so he even thoguh he is rhaegar and lyannas kid, he has a questionable claim
[7/17/17, 12:38:39 PM] Miller: What happened to the dude who was banging the red head?
[7/17/17, 12:38:44 PM] Justin: speaking of which, whatever happened to robs bastard?
[7/17/17, 12:38:50 PM] Justin: that guy
[7/17/17, 12:38:50 PM] Miller: The one who killed his daughter
[7/17/17, 12:39:04 PM] Justin: hes dead
[7/17/17, 12:39:06 PM] Miller: That big chick kill him?
[7/17/17, 12:39:12 PM] Justin: snasa gril killed him
[7/17/17, 12:39:25 PM] Donk: stannis was killed by briene
[7/17/17, 12:39:26 PM] Miller: I thought so
[7/17/17, 12:39:31 PM] Miller: Couldn't remember
[7/17/17, 12:39:35 PM] Justin: but what baout robs bastard kid
[7/17/17, 12:39:39 PM] Justin: who also banged the redhead
[7/17/17, 12:39:38 PM] Donk: also, rob didnt have a bastard
[7/17/17, 12:39:49 PM] Justin: baratheon
[7/17/17, 12:39:50 PM] Donk: oh, you mean robert baratheon?
[7/17/17, 12:39:53 PM] Justin: not stark
[7/17/17, 12:39:55 PM] Donk: the blacksmith kid?
[7/17/17, 12:40:02 PM] Justin: yeh
[7/17/17, 12:40:03 PM] Donk: he got put on a boat by davos
[7/17/17, 12:40:10 PM] Donk: and told to row from dragonstone to kings landing
[7/17/17, 12:40:21 PM] Donk: except he didnt know how to swim
[7/17/17, 12:40:26 PM] Donk: so, yeah, probalby dead
[7/17/17, 12:40:28 PM] Justin: so another words, nothing
[7/17/17, 12:40:29 PM] Donk: but maybe he made it?
[7/17/17, 12:40:30 PM] Miller: The opening scene was awesome
[7/17/17, 12:41:21 PM] Miller: How did the guy from the wire get his army?
[7/17/17, 12:41:38 PM] Miller: Was it when he killed that girls aunt?
[7/17/17, 12:42:12 PM] Justin: which guy is from the wire?
[7/17/17, 12:42:32 PM] Justin: you mean greyjoy and his army?
[7/17/17, 12:42:33 PM] Donk: i assume he means littlefinger
[7/17/17, 12:42:42 PM] Justin: oh yeh
[7/17/17, 12:42:51 PM] Donk: and if so, then yes, its the army of the vale
[7/17/17, 12:42:55 PM] Justin: forgot he was the politician in that
[7/17/17, 12:43:05 PM] Justin: is that boy dead yet?
[7/17/17, 12:43:19 PM] Donk: he is in the book, not sure if is in the show, cant remember
[7/17/17, 12:43:28 PM] Justin: if that boy dies does little finger lose army?
[7/17/17, 12:43:49 PM] Donk: he dies towards the end of the last book, so its unclear
[7/17/17, 12:43:51 PM] Miller: Is it his or Sansa?
[7/17/17, 12:44:13 PM] Donk: but that whole storyline is very different in the books, as sansa doesnt go back to winterfell in the books yet
[7/17/17, 12:44:23 PM] Donk: and ramsey bolton marries an imposter arya and not sansa in the book
[7/17/17, 12:45:14 PM] Donk: the imposter arya is actually sansas best childhood friend jenye pool, who they make act like arya to strengthen their claim to winterfell
[7/17/17, 12:45:36 PM] Donk: it is also implied that ramsey lets his dogs rape her
[7/17/17, 12:45:49 PM] Donk: george rr martin is a messed up person haha
[7/17/17, 12:47:37 PM] Miller: oh man the mike and mad dog 30 for 30 finally came out? yasssssssssss
[7/17/17, 12:51:03 PM] Miller: one other GOT question am i supposed to know who ed sheerans crew is? or are they new characters?
[7/17/17, 12:51:19 PM] Donk: just random lannister soldiers
[7/17/17, 12:51:40 PM] Miller: how did they not make him a wildling?
[7/17/17, 12:51:42 PM] Miller: bad casting
[7/17/17, 12:51:57 PM] Donk: the whole scene was a throwaway to tell us arya is going to king landing vs going to winterfell to meet up with jon and sana
[7/17/17, 12:52:32 PM] Miller: i thought we already knew that
[7/17/17, 12:52:37 PM] Miller: probably just a favor to ed
[7/17/17, 12:52:40 PM] Donk: it seems totally out of place and put in their just to starfuck shereen
[7/17/17, 12:52:42 PM] Justin: Lol so essentially you found a unicorn, or more likely a girl completely fucked in the head as per evidence of her entire profile , to agree with your weak dick thesis.
[7/17/17, 12:53:15 PM] Launchpad: 'fucked in the head' aka has a sense of humor
[7/17/17, 12:53:31 PM] Miller: or maybe the entire profile is satire, which just makes LPs point more hilarious
[7/17/17, 12:53:52 PM] Justin: Well I was gonna mention the entire profile is sarcastic
[7/17/17, 12:54:29 PM] Donk: it could also be steve trying to catfish launchpad
[7/17/17, 12:54:30 PM] Justin: But she's still coming from an area of openness
[7/17/17, 12:55:04 PM] Justin: As in some guy definitely fucked her over and she's dealing with it.
[7/17/17, 12:55:28 PM] Justin: Obviously she didn't give good enough head to keep him from cheating
[7/17/17, 12:55:44 PM] Kiyoon: keep it in the GOT chat
[7/17/17, 12:55:47 PM] Kiyoon: I'll add you Herman if I can?
[7/17/17, 12:56:26 PM] Justin: Would be amazing if it was steve cat fishing
[7/17/17, 12:56:28 PM] Kiyoon: I didnt watch last night no spoilers!
[7/17/17, 12:57:35 PM] Launchpad: would be a really weird pathetic way to spend time considering the very low probability of me seeing that person
[7/17/17, 12:58:10 PM] Miller: add me also
[7/17/17, 12:58:22 PM] Justin: You clearly don't watch enough catfish
[7/17/17, 12:58:23 PM] Miller: now that im free from the threat of you book people spoling me
[7/17/17, 1:01:51 PM] Launchpad: no I don't
[7/17/17, 1:02:34 PM] Kiyoon: you're already in it millz
[7/17/17, 2:22:57 PM] Launchpad: guys I got a new nomination for next years draft
[7/17/17, 2:23:01 PM] Launchpad: San Diego Pride
[7/17/17, 2:23:22 PM] Launchpad: My top choice is still Timbuktu
[7/17/17, 2:25:45 PM] Miller: you know the rule
[7/17/17, 2:26:02 PM] Miller: not going anywhere that is too convenient for you
[7/17/17, 2:26:46 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/17/17, 2:27:06 PM] Launchpad: thats fine, Im going back next year
[7/17/17, 2:27:09 PM] Launchpad: so much fun
[7/17/17, 2:39:55 PM] Sean: Im all about San Diego pride
[7/17/17, 2:45:43 PM] Launchpad: lol yeah got 1 vote
[7/17/17, 2:45:51 PM] Launchpad: you would have loved it
[7/17/17, 2:47:16 PM] Miller: im sure w/e we go sean will say its the gay capital of something
[7/17/17, 2:47:27 PM] Miller: austin is the gay capital of texas
[7/17/17, 2:47:36 PM] Miller: montreal was the gay capital of canada
[7/17/17, 2:47:53 PM] Launchpad: Lol too many gay capitals in California
[7/17/17, 3:04:40 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/17/17, 3:04:40 PM] Miller: FAKE NEWS
[7/17/17, 3:05:47 PM] Donk: would be so much better if its true
[7/17/17, 3:10:04 PM] Launchpad: we cannot confirm that it is not true
[7/17/17, 3:10:26 PM] Miller: Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Swift
[7/17/17, 3:14:39 PM] Launchpad: I know this is a few hours ago but didn't get to mention this earlier -- if you're afraid of a 20% stock loss with your savings because you're using that money as a down payment on a house -- you might want to reconsider leveraging out your life savings 5x on a 20% down-payment for an illiquid investment that you may end up losing all of
[7/17/17, 3:16:00 PM] Kiyoon: you renting forever?
[7/17/17, 3:16:32 PM] Donk: asssuming you dont default on your house, i think you are far more likley to lose money in the stock market than to not be able to at least recoup your down payment
[7/17/17, 3:16:48 PM] Launchpad: based on what?
[7/17/17, 3:16:56 PM] Donk: based on historical housing prices
[7/17/17, 3:17:13 PM] Launchpad: have you looked at historical stock market prices?
[7/17/17, 3:17:16 PM] Donk: but buying a house is not really an investment like a stock would be
[7/17/17, 3:17:19 PM] Miller: not understanding there is a place for risk free 100% liquid assets in your net worth is crazy
[7/17/17, 3:17:54 PM] Donk: and im also not saying that buying a house is a smart move for everyone, it isnt
[7/17/17, 3:17:59 PM] Launchpad: I understand that -- I was just proposing an alternative idea
[7/17/17, 3:18:04 PM] Miller: everybody i know, lots of smart rich guys, keep at least 15-20% of their $ in a risk free account
[7/17/17, 3:18:12 PM] Miller: so if you can earn 1.3% instead of literally 0, why not
[7/17/17, 3:18:59 PM] Miller: do you have a $10k emergency fund? if so put it an online savings account so you earn some interest on it
[7/17/17, 3:19:00 PM] Miller: its not rocket science
[7/17/17, 3:21:50 PM] Launchpad: its also not rocket science to understand that someone like me -- who is NOT a millionaire trying to protect my money, but someone who is young and wants it to grow and compound would look for larger returns
[7/17/17, 3:22:16 PM] Miller: thats fine, nobody should be investing money until they have at least a 10k emergency fund
[7/17/17, 3:22:20 PM] Launchpad: stocks are fairly liquid
[7/17/17, 3:22:57 PM] Launchpad: so I could raise that money in very short order
[7/17/17, 3:23:33 PM] Miller: great, i know you well enough to know you are not going to change your mind, its your $ do w/e you want with it
[7/17/17, 3:26:32 PM] Launchpad: I would say that number is probably different if you live alone and are single vs having a family to feed
[7/17/17, 3:27:20 PM] Donk: *alone or with a top hat?
[7/17/17, 3:27:48 PM] Launchpad: i don't wear hats
[7/17/17, 3:28:12 PM] Donk: I thought you live with your brother?
[7/17/17, 3:28:32 PM] Launchpad: hes his own person
[7/17/17, 3:29:18 PM] Donk: Also, agreed on the hats #baldpride
[7/17/17, 3:29:24 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/17/17, 3:30:20 PM] Miller: 10k is just a ballpark, i think general wisdom is 6 months salary
[7/17/17, 3:31:51 PM] Launchpad: look I understand the need to have cash -- I was just proposing an alternative idea, as many are not aware of conservative income producing strategies and park their money where it will get eaten by inflation
[7/17/17, 3:31:52 PM] Steve: I should start putting money away from each check honestly
[7/17/17, 3:32:01 PM] Steve: I have a 401k and and IRA
[7/17/17, 3:32:10 PM] Launchpad: ^^^ I would applaud you for it
[7/17/17, 3:32:13 PM] Steve: But I should be putting $100 away every week in general
[7/17/17, 3:32:45 PM] Miller: its apples and oranges, nobody is confusing an online savings account for an investment vehicle
[7/17/17, 3:33:00 PM] Miller: its literally an extension of your checking account
[7/17/17, 3:33:28 PM] Donk: 1.3% is a lot better than what my chase savings account pays
[7/17/17, 3:33:42 PM] Donk: i have been getting ~.01 per month
[7/17/17, 3:33:57 PM] Launchpad: comparatively speaking it is a really good offer
[7/17/17, 3:34:13 PM] Miller: i moved my $ into purepoint at 1.25 and im too lazy to move it for 5bps
[7/17/17, 3:34:29 PM] Miller: better to earn something than nothing
[7/17/17, 3:36:03 PM] Launchpad: Actually holding cash is something I am consciously aware of that I need to do more of.....not to protect that money, but to have cash on hand when a good opportunity comes along
[7/17/17, 3:38:33 PM] Miller: im not investing any $ i am potentially going to be using in the next 12-18 months
[7/17/17, 3:39:05 PM] Steve: Same
[7/17/17, 3:39:11 PM] Steve: I made $13 last year
[7/17/17, 3:39:24 PM] Miller: at least you probably didnt pay a lot in taxes?
[7/17/17, 3:39:33 PM] Steve: Really helped me buy a Taco Bell meal
[7/17/17, 3:39:37 PM] Miller: lol
[7/17/17, 3:39:42 PM] Steve: I paid half of $13
[7/17/17, 3:39:44 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/17/17, 3:40:43 PM] Steve: I don't know if I'll put all my savings in this new account but I'm starting out with half
[7/17/17, 3:41:46 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/17/17, 3:42:36 PM] Steve: What's funny?
[7/17/17, 3:44:02 PM] Launchpad: honestly the best way to save for almost everyone is to automatically transfer money on pay day to your savings vehicle.  You will not even notice its gone and you will check your account months later and suddenly have thousands of dollars
[7/17/17, 3:44:43 PM] Steve: I mean, I have that
[7/17/17, 3:45:05 PM] Steve: I also put most of my tax return into my savings
[7/17/17, 3:45:16 PM] Steve: But I still should be putting away every week
[7/17/17, 3:45:26 PM] Steve: Other than a 401k/IRA

[7/17/17, 5:07:29 PM] Miller: no video of him doing it, only drunk eyewitnesses, he will get off
[7/17/17, 5:08:43 PM] Steve: He should be charged
[7/17/17, 5:08:49 PM] Steve: Fucking dick
[7/17/17, 5:09:21 PM] Miller: steve gonna have to burn his elliot jersey before he even gets to wear it once
[7/17/17, 5:09:41 PM] Steve: I don't have an Elliot jersey
[7/17/17, 5:10:05 PM] Steve: Only Prescott
[7/17/17, 5:10:07 PM] Miller: buy one and burn it
[7/17/17, 5:10:14 PM] Steve: No thank you
[7/17/17, 5:11:02 PM] Donk: are the cowboys going ot be able to field a team opening week?
[7/17/17, 5:11:10 PM] Donk: as this rate half of them will be suspended
[7/17/17, 5:11:17 PM] Launchpad: Lol
[7/17/17, 5:11:21 PM] Miller: depends if mcfadden finally got an otterbox
[7/17/17, 5:11:24 PM] Donk: (which is great news for the giants, as for like the 100th year in a row we play them opening sunday night in dallas)
[7/17/17, 5:11:40 PM] Miller: unless they all just appeal and play opening game
[7/17/17, 5:11:44 PM] Miller: and then miss a game vs SF or something
[7/17/17, 5:11:57 PM] Donk: i dont think it works that way in the nfl like it does in baseball
[7/17/17, 5:12:14 PM] Steve: Pretty sure you can play through appeals
[7/17/17, 5:12:42 PM] Steve: But either way, if he punched the guy he should be suspended.
[7/17/17, 5:13:45 PM] Miller: as always its not what you did, its what they can prove
[7/17/17, 5:14:11 PM] Miller: and im sure this guy will take a six figure payday to not press charges and settle if zeke did it
[7/17/17, 5:14:25 PM] Miller: no charges, no video i cant see the NFL doing anything
[7/17/17, 5:14:42 PM] Steve: The NFL doesn't need anything to happen in the court of law
[7/17/17, 5:14:56 PM] Miller: oh tom brady knows that very well
[7/17/17, 5:15:05 PM] Miller: but they do generally need some evidence
[7/17/17, 5:15:14 PM] Steve: So it doesn't matter if he is convicted or or on trial for anything
[7/17/17, 5:15:34 PM] Miller: im aware they COULD suspend him under the conduct policy for w/e they want, i just think its unlikely
[7/17/17, 5:15:37 PM] Steve: I'm sure a couple a couple of people saying he was there and did it will be enough for them
[7/17/17, 5:15:45 PM] Steve: Doubt it
[7/17/17, 5:56:19 PM] Launchpad: nothing happened to McCoy last year
[7/17/17, 5:56:27 PM] Launchpad: he knocked some guy out

[7/17/17, 7:12:00 PM] Steve: Also, anyone want to go to a soccer game Wednesday night at 7:30?
[7/17/17, 7:15:19 PM] Launchpad: so serious question ---- if you're talking shit....and the idea is to get under the other persons skin -- does that actually make you a racist for using racist language?  Same thing goes for someone fat, bald, ugly etc
[7/17/17, 7:16:17 PM] Launchpad: like if you're pissed at me and call me a bald asshole.....that doesn't mean you hate all bald people does it?
[7/17/17, 7:16:23 PM] Steve: I don't know what you are saying
[7/17/17, 7:16:31 PM] Steve: I hate you
[7/17/17, 7:16:34 PM] Steve: So, close
[7/17/17, 7:16:42 PM] Steve: But that doesn't mean I hate all scotts
[7/17/17, 7:16:43 PM] Launchpad: also Im not commenting specifically on mcgregor
[7/17/17, 7:16:46 PM] Steve: Or all bald people
[7/17/17, 7:16:48 PM] Steve: Just you
[7/17/17, 7:17:47 PM] Steve: But that's not the same as using the N word
[7/17/17, 7:18:20 PM] Steve: If that's what you mean
[7/17/17, 7:18:46 PM] Launchpad: what if your goal was to set someone on tilt
[7/17/17, 7:19:00 PM] Steve: Still not the same
[7/17/17, 7:19:08 PM] Steve: Doesn't matter what your goal is
[7/17/17, 7:19:36 PM] Steve: Really feel like this shouldn't have to be explained to a 30+ year old
[7/17/17, 7:19:44 PM] Launchpad: alright, time to take down another shuffleboard championship

[7/17/17, 8:11:43 PM] Steve: It's mind bottling
[7/17/17, 8:12:49 PM] Launchpad: i don't
[7/17/17, 8:12:49 PM] Launchpad: clearly
[7/17/17, 8:13:26 PM] Launchpad: Im just pointing out the fact you can call someone a bald asshole and it doesn't mean you hate all bald people
[7/17/17, 8:13:37 PM] Launchpad: Its mind bottling that you can't see the double standard
[7/17/17, 8:13:46 PM] Launchpad: its also mind bottling that you don't realize you actually live on an island

[7/17/17, 8:32:04 PM] Steve: Yup, it is
[7/17/17, 8:32:11 PM] Launchpad: you're pointing out something about someones physical appearance - something that person might be sensitive about
[7/17/17, 8:32:27 PM] Steve: That's not what racism is
[7/17/17, 8:32:30 PM] Launchpad: If I call you a fat fuck, thats not just offensive to you, but anyone who is fat
[7/17/17, 8:32:43 PM] Launchpad: I know what racism is
[7/17/17, 8:32:50 PM] Steve: I don't think you do
[7/17/17, 8:32:53 PM] Launchpad: but Im pointing out the double standard
[7/17/17, 8:32:57 PM] Steve: It's becoming more and more evident
[7/17/17, 8:33:02 PM] Steve: Still no double standard
[7/17/17, 8:33:08 PM] Steve: But you can keep saying that
[7/17/17, 8:33:11 PM] Launchpad: i don't think it is
[7/17/17, 8:33:33 PM] Launchpad: No one has ever accused me of being racist outside this chat
[7/17/17, 8:33:44 PM] Launchpad: all I was asking was a question
[7/17/17, 8:33:46 PM] Steve: Who is accusing you of being racist?
[7/17/17, 8:34:00 PM] Launchpad: well then I guess no one
[7/17/17, 8:34:05 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/17/17, 8:34:22 PM] Steve: So this was all about you thinking people in here think you are racist?
[7/17/17, 8:34:38 PM] Launchpad: lol nope not all all
[7/17/17, 8:35:24 PM] Launchpad: you brought the issue of racism with that mayweather / mcgreggor article -- I was just asking a related question
[7/17/17, 8:35:40 PM] Steve: I actually just posted the article and asked watts what he thought
[7/17/17, 8:35:50 PM] Steve: Egged him on to get a reaction
[7/17/17, 8:35:59 PM] Steve: Then you went of my on a tangent
[7/17/17, 8:36:02 PM] Launchpad: and I just asked a theoretical question
[7/17/17, 8:36:10 PM] Launchpad: egged you on to get a reaction üòÇ
[7/17/17, 8:36:40 PM] Steve: Trying to draw some sort parallel between racism and being mean

[7/17/17, 8:36:58 PM] Steve: It was the undefeated

[7/17/17, 11:20:35 PM] Justin: was interesting and very similar to subprime mess, which article points out

[7/18/17, 6:01:39 AM] Miller: New GOP health bill lacks the votes to pass | http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/342447-two-more-gop-senators-defect-on-healthcare-bill
[7/18/17, 6:02:06 AM] Miller: With Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Jerry Moran (Kansas) last night joining Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Rand Paul (Kentucky) in opposition to the bill, it is once again dead. All four have said they will oppose the "motion to proceed" that is the procedural necessity to even begin debate on the bill. As with everything health care related, this can change again. But this sure feels like BCRA/AHCA is finally dead - and not Jon Snow dead. Dead dead.
[7/18/17, 6:31:15 AM] Steve: Maybe now they can actually try and fix what we have
[7/18/17, 6:31:26 AM] Steve: Put money, time and effort into that.
[7/18/17, 6:31:43 AM] Steve: Now that they wasted 7 years and 6 months on nothing.
[7/18/17, 9:03:53 AM] Miller: ‚ÄúWhen people go around and say, ‚ÄòYou are black‚Äô‚Äîwell, I don‚Äôt encourage it, but by the same token I don‚Äôt back off of it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf you want to call me that, that‚Äôs fine. But, you know, in my whole family, there‚Äôs nobody I know who is black.‚Äù Raised in Queens Michael Todd Tirico grew up in a middle-class Italian family in Queens, about a five-minute drive from Shea Stadium. Tirico‚Äôs parents, Donald and Maria, were separated when he was about 4, and he says he has since lost contact with his father‚Äôs side of the family. Tirico is an only child. Because of his dark skin and ethnic features, Tirico says, most people assume he is black. But he‚Äôs seen pictures of his father, his father‚Äôs mother and his father‚Äôs sister‚Äîall of whom are white, Tirico says.

‚ÄúThe only contact I had growing up was with my mom‚Äôs side of the family. And they are all as white as the refrigerator I‚Äôm standing in front of right now,‚Äù Tirico says, standing in his kitchen in the Clay townhouse where he lives. Someday, he says, he plans to do genealogical research to find out if he has a black ancestor, but it‚Äôs not something he considers a pressing issue. Tirico concedes, though, that his uncertain ethnicity sometimes makes other uncomfortable. Even skeptical. ‚ÄúI know the story sounds like a lot of bull, but it‚Äôs the truth‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDoes it matter to me? Yeah, I‚Äôd like to find out the truth at some point, so I can answer questions for my kids. But me? I‚Äôm living, I‚Äôm working, I‚Äôm leading an upstanding life. I don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù
[7/18/17, 9:04:24 AM] Miller: so this guys parents are both white
[7/18/17, 9:04:28 AM] Miller: hes 50 years old
[7/18/17, 9:04:33 AM] Miller: is nobody going to tell him hes adopted?
[7/18/17, 9:05:37 AM] Donk: Lol, thats crazy
[7/18/17, 9:07:12 AM] Steve: Biologically I think that can happen
[7/18/17, 9:07:22 AM] Steve: It's extremely rare but I think that can happen
[7/18/17, 9:15:42 AM] Miller: i guess its also possible his mom cheated
[7/18/17, 9:17:43 AM] Steve: Or he has great great grandparents who we black
[7/18/17, 9:17:48 AM] Steve: That he never met
[7/18/17, 9:18:53 AM] Kiyoon: That's mind blowing
[7/18/17, 9:20:02 AM] Miller: yea so im gonna say 49.95% chance of his mom cheating, 49.95% chance of him being adopted and .1% chance of w/e genetic magic anomaly steve is referring to
[7/18/17, 9:21:55 AM] Steve: http://nypost.com/2010/07/21/blond-bombshell/
[7/18/17, 9:22:11 AM] Steve: Magic Anomaly
[7/18/17, 9:23:01 AM] Donk: or she cheated
[7/18/17, 9:23:01 AM] Miller: let me pull a steve for you
[7/18/17, 9:23:02 AM] Miller: NY post?

[7/18/17, 9:23:10 AM] Steve: This apparently can happen as well
[7/18/17, 9:23:11 AM] Miller: daily mail?
[7/18/17, 9:23:13 AM] Miller: whats next?
[7/18/17, 9:23:16 AM] Miller: national enquirer?
[7/18/17, 9:23:22 AM] Miller: bat baby born to human parents
[7/18/17, 9:23:23 AM] Donk: would have helped if they did a blood test
[7/18/17, 9:23:54 AM] Miller: if my wife had a black kid my first thought would not be wow its a miracle, and even if i SAID that, it would not make it so
[7/18/17, 9:24:39 AM] Miller: but i would love to see some reputable sources who actually did genetic testing to confirm the parents are the parents
[7/18/17, 9:25:12 AM] Miller: and "million to one" sorry i was actually giving you odds that were too good with the .1% then, my mistake
[7/18/17, 9:26:07 AM] Steve: I'm pretty sure I stated that it was extremely rare above
[7/18/17, 9:26:13 AM] Steve: Don't know if you read that part
[7/18/17, 9:26:31 AM] Miller: so then let me rephrase
[7/18/17, 9:26:45 AM] Miller: yea so im gonna say 49.995% chance of his mom cheating, 49.995% chance of him being adopted and .001% chance of w/e genetic magic anomaly steve is referring to
[7/18/17, 9:26:47 AM] Miller: more accurate
[7/18/17, 9:26:58 AM] Miller: thank you for clarifying that

[7/18/17, 9:27:58 AM] Miller: thats a biracial couple
[7/18/17, 9:28:07 AM] Miller: zomg biracial babies born to biracial couple
[7/18/17, 9:28:09 AM] Miller: insanity
[7/18/17, 9:28:23 AM] Steve: That's also extremely rare lol
[7/18/17, 9:28:33 AM] Steve: Especially the twins being biracial
[7/18/17, 9:28:34 AM] Steve: Sorry
[7/18/17, 9:28:37 AM] Miller: it may be but its also completely different than this story
[7/18/17, 9:28:41 AM] Steve: I forgot you had the stats in that too
[7/18/17, 9:28:42 AM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 9:28:45 AM] Miller: its also rare to get hit by lightning
[7/18/17, 9:29:10 AM] Miller: Between 1942 and 1977, Sullivan was hit by lightning on seven different occasions and survived all of them
[7/18/17, 9:29:11 AM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 9:29:13 AM] Miller: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Sullivan
[7/18/17, 9:29:23 AM] Steve: Stupidest argument ever
[7/18/17, 9:29:34 AM] Steve: You beat out LP from yesterday
[7/18/17, 9:29:34 AM] Miller: not really an argument
[7/18/17, 9:30:42 AM] Miller: the only disagreement is i dont even think its worth mentioning or discussing b/c its so unlikely
[7/18/17, 9:30:53 AM] Miller: you apparently like mike tricos parents and want to give them the benefit of the doubt
[7/18/17, 9:31:08 AM] Steve: I would like to assume they would have told him by now
[7/18/17, 9:31:11 AM] Steve: But maybe not
[7/18/17, 9:31:16 AM] Steve: If he was adopted
[7/18/17, 9:31:25 AM] Miller: i would assume you would not need to tell someone if they have made it to 50
[7/18/17, 9:31:26 AM] Miller: like figure it out
[7/18/17, 9:31:27 AM] Steve: At 50 I think you can handle it
[7/18/17, 9:31:41 AM] Steve: He clearly doesn't care either way
[7/18/17, 9:31:46 AM] Steve: In fact, he said so
[7/18/17, 9:31:46 AM] Miller: if you were black and your parents were white you dont think by 30 you would not have been like hmm maybe i am adopted
[7/18/17, 9:31:55 AM] Steve: Don't know
[7/18/17, 9:31:57 AM] Steve: Maybe
[7/18/17, 9:33:00 AM] Steve: Just read up on that first woman from the daily mail
[7/18/17, 9:33:10 AM] Steve: She had a second white baby
[7/18/17, 9:33:19 AM] Steve: Crazy
[7/18/17, 9:33:32 AM] Miller: unless it was a bat baby im not impressed
[7/18/17, 9:33:54 AM] Steve: I don't know what a bat baby is
[7/18/17, 9:34:05 AM] Miller: also that womans husband is white
[7/18/17, 9:34:29 AM] Steve: Regardless, it's still even more than a million to one to have a second white baby
[7/18/17, 9:35:15 AM] Miller: that may be all well and good, but nobody with all white parents/grandparents is having a black kid, especially one with the skin tone of mike trico
[7/18/17, 9:35:37 AM] Steve: Still don't know what that means
[7/18/17, 9:35:47 AM] Steve: Mike tirico should really find out for you
[7/18/17, 9:35:56 AM] Miller: what are the odds of having a bat baby?
[7/18/17, 9:36:37 AM] Miller: roughly the same as mike tricos parents/grandparents being all white
[7/18/17, 9:37:43 AM] Steve: Also, bats can't impregnate a woman
[7/18/17, 9:37:47 AM] Steve: So, impossible
[7/18/17, 9:38:08 AM] Miller: could be a recessive bat gene
[7/18/17, 9:38:17 AM] Steve: Still not possible
[7/18/17, 9:38:30 AM] Steve: But you can continue to troll
[7/18/17, 9:40:41 AM] Launchpad: Bro you sure you ain't a Republican? You certainly a hypocrite
[7/18/17, 9:41:29 AM] Launchpad: What next? You going to tell us geography ain't real?
[7/18/17, 9:56:06 AM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 9:56:17 AM] Steve: To you and your statements
[7/18/17, 9:56:24 AM] Steve: Keep my name out of your mouth
[7/18/17, 9:59:45 AM] Miller: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/07/17/hip-hoprb-has-now-become-the-dominant-genre-in-the-u-s-for-the-first-time/#52bf20f85383
[7/18/17, 10:26:02 AM] Steve: Anyone want to go to a soccer game @ 7:30 tomorrow?
[7/18/17, 10:26:13 AM] Steve: Yankee stadium
[7/18/17, 10:31:07 AM] Launchpad: you literally said the same exact thing when I linked the Post, so don't get mad you're a hypocrite and getting called on your shit
[7/18/17, 10:32:52 AM] Launchpad: ü§ó
[7/18/17, 10:33:59 AM] Steve: I was trolling those two
[7/18/17, 10:34:04 AM] Steve: You were being serious
[7/18/17, 10:34:14 AM] Steve: Again, keep my name out your mouth
[7/18/17, 10:34:17 AM] Steve: You bald fuck
[7/18/17, 10:34:20 AM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 10:34:31 AM] Steve: ^just in case people think I'm mad
[7/18/17, 10:35:01 AM] Launchpad: Hmmm....don't remember saying your name ü§î
[7/18/17, 10:35:11 AM] Launchpad: Don't you have a healthcare bill to mourn??
[7/18/17, 10:35:16 AM] Steve: I don't
[7/18/17, 10:35:32 AM] Steve: I'm ecstatic that I get to keep my health insurance
[7/18/17, 10:35:42 AM] Steve: And not be stripped of it by your party
[7/18/17, 10:35:55 AM] Steve: Who will now just try to take it away offering no alternative
[7/18/17, 10:36:13 AM] Launchpad: ** Our party
[7/18/17, 10:36:19 AM] Steve: Not mine
[7/18/17, 10:36:34 AM] Steve: Never will be
[7/18/17, 10:38:16 AM] Donk: what player is this referring to?
[7/18/17, 10:39:16 AM] Miller: julian edelman posted it
[7/18/17, 10:48:29 AM] Donk: ah ok, i thought it was some womens softball player or something with a nickname like Jules
[7/18/17, 10:55:47 AM] Launchpad: just a bitch from boston
[7/18/17, 12:49:14 PM] Justin: Seems like podcast everyone would like. http://m.espn.com/general/cast?id=19472136&src=desktop
[7/18/17, 1:05:25 PM] Justin: https://30for30podcasts.com/episodes/a-queen-of-sorts/
[7/18/17, 1:09:50 PM] Donk: weird, i just read on article ont hat the other day
[7/18/17, 1:10:01 PM] Donk: didnt espn just do a longform on it?
[7/18/17, 1:27:03 PM] Miller: theringer just had an article on him i believe
[7/18/17, 1:31:25 PM] Donk: Ah thats where i saw it
[7/18/17, 1:34:52 PM] Miller: https://www.si.com/mmqb/2017/06/07/colin-kaepernick-backup-quarterbacks not sure how i missed this article but he raises a lot of points for you guys to ignore
[7/18/17, 1:35:16 PM] Steve: Too bad there are 30 teams
[7/18/17, 1:35:27 PM] Miller: too bad you didnt read the article
[7/18/17, 1:36:01 PM] Steve: Call me when you find an article that starts with every backup quarterback is better than kap, here's why...
[7/18/17, 1:36:07 PM] Miller: im sure albert breer is just a racist also
[7/18/17, 1:36:23 PM] Steve: Again, he states 15 quarterbacks
[7/18/17, 1:36:30 PM] Steve: Which is all well and good
[7/18/17, 1:36:37 PM] Steve: What about the other 15 teams
[7/18/17, 1:36:40 PM] Steve: ?
[7/18/17, 1:36:50 PM] Miller: who knows, i bet there is no way to find out the answer
[7/18/17, 1:36:57 PM] Miller: being that it isnt stated in the title of the article
[7/18/17, 1:38:00 PM] Steve: But keep thinking it isn't based on racism. We all realize thats where you stand in it. No need to keep bringing it up.
[7/18/17, 1:38:20 PM] Steve: And @17189742074 and @16195657200 agree
[7/18/17, 1:38:26 PM] Steve: We know and realize that
[7/18/17, 1:38:37 PM] Miller: yes, we know, everyone who thinks kapernick sucks at football is racist, we get it
[7/18/17, 1:38:47 PM] Steve: I didn't say that
[7/18/17, 1:38:53 PM] Steve: Nor have I even implied hat
[7/18/17, 1:38:56 PM] Steve: *that
[7/18/17, 1:39:32 PM] Launchpad: do you think he'd have a job if he sat during the anthem to protest the Dakota Pipeline?
[7/18/17, 1:40:05 PM] Steve: Possibly
[7/18/17, 1:40:11 PM] Steve: But who knows
[7/18/17, 1:40:14 PM] Steve: He didn't
[7/18/17, 1:41:07 PM] Launchpad: Possibly, racism wasn't involved
[7/18/17, 1:41:25 PM] Steve: I believe it was 80/20
[7/18/17, 1:42:14 PM] Steve: I believe 80% had to do with him not standing for the anthem because of social inequality and 20% is that some teams don't believe in his ability.
[7/18/17, 1:42:26 PM] Steve: Again, IMO
[7/18/17, 1:43:48 PM] Steve: Are there better backups in the entire NFL? Yes. Is he better than at least 10 of the 30 backups? I think so.
[7/18/17, 1:45:02 PM] Launchpad: but will he take the league minimum?
[7/18/17, 1:45:26 PM] Miller: generally speaking teams look for stable, veteran, pocket passers and guys who have been successful in that role before to fill the QB2 role
[7/18/17, 1:47:02 PM] Steve: None of us know the answer to that
[7/18/17, 1:47:32 PM] Steve: That's a very general statement
[7/18/17, 1:47:42 PM] Steve: Teams have different views on that
[7/18/17, 1:47:56 PM] Steve: Depending on the staff and philosophy
[7/18/17, 1:48:52 PM] Miller: hence why i said generally speaking
[7/18/17, 1:49:04 PM] Miller: but that eliminates a lot of job opportunities b/c he doesnt remotely fit that mold
[7/18/17, 1:49:52 PM] Miller: i would not want him to be the giants backup QB
[7/18/17, 1:50:05 PM] Miller: i would be happy w/him as the backup of any other NFC east team
[7/18/17, 1:50:26 PM] Miller: now thats 80% based on football and only 20% based on racism
[7/18/17, 1:50:53 PM] Miller: oh wait the giants current backup QB is black? damn nm
[7/18/17, 1:51:21 PM] Scott: And had josh Johnson
[7/18/17, 1:51:24 PM] Scott: And he's black too
[7/18/17, 1:51:39 PM] Miller: was he ever QB2 or always QB3?
[7/18/17, 1:51:45 PM] Miller: i didnt think he was ever next in line but i cant remember
[7/18/17, 1:52:12 PM] Miller: even as much as @16318489683 hates geno i cant imagine he would rather have kapernick as the backup
[7/18/17, 1:53:43 PM] Steve: Your owner literally said why they didn't sign him
[7/18/17, 1:54:01 PM] Steve: And guess what the reason was?
[7/18/17, 1:54:09 PM] Steve: How he plays? Nope
[7/18/17, 1:54:35 PM] Miller: pete carroll didnt sign him and he said he was the best QB in the league i think
[7/18/17, 1:54:43 PM] Steve: He didn't say that either
[7/18/17, 1:55:02 PM] Steve: Love how you have lied about both Pete caroll and I have allegedly said
[7/18/17, 1:55:20 PM] Steve: And you boy @17189742074 he protector of honesty and integrity stays quiet
[7/18/17, 1:55:23 PM] Steve: ü§î
[7/18/17, 1:55:27 PM] Steve: Just a thought
[7/18/17, 1:55:37 PM] Miller: i wonder if the giants not signging him has anything at all to do w/the fact they have 4 QBs on the roster
[7/18/17, 1:55:39 PM] Miller: na probably just racism
[7/18/17, 1:55:57 PM] Steve: He literally said why he didn't sign him
[7/18/17, 1:56:02 PM] Miller: sorry if exaggerating is now lying, then yes, i am guilty, lock me up
[7/18/17, 1:56:04 PM] Launchpad: they said his protest was a factor....they didn't say what he was protesting was a factor.  Could have been the Dakota Pipeline too
[7/18/17, 1:56:04 PM] Steve: And it had nothing to do with 4 QB's
[7/18/17, 1:56:07 PM] Miller: hyperbole is a crime
[7/18/17, 1:56:29 PM] Steve: That's what your boy @17189742074 does
[7/18/17, 1:56:39 PM] Steve: I'm just basing on your group
[7/18/17, 1:56:45 PM] Steve: You all think and feel the same
[7/18/17, 1:56:46 PM] Miller: you act like the giants have this massive hole at QB and worked him out and then decided no we just cant deal w/the protesting even though you are so talented and good at football
[7/18/17, 1:56:50 PM] Steve: Let's be consistent boys
[7/18/17, 1:56:52 PM] Miller: giants have more QBs than they need
[7/18/17, 1:57:15 PM] Miller: why didnt he cowboys cut dak and sign him?
[7/18/17, 1:57:19 PM] Miller: is it b/c jerry jones is racist?
[7/18/17, 1:57:48 PM] Miller: you should really get rid of that dak jersey, that guys just standing in kapernicks way of having a job
[7/18/17, 1:57:50 PM] Steve: I don't care what you think anymore
[7/18/17, 1:58:08 PM] Steve: Do you and think what you want
[7/18/17, 1:58:10 PM] Miller: b/c when it comes to kapernick, the only thing that doesnt matter is the football
[7/18/17, 1:58:14 PM] Steve: I've already stated my opinion
[7/18/17, 1:58:19 PM] Steve: If you don't agree with it
[7/18/17, 1:58:22 PM] Steve: Don't give a fuck
[7/18/17, 1:58:28 PM] Steve: Not trying to convince you
[7/18/17, 1:58:31 PM] Miller: not good? team doesnt remotely need a QB? who cares, its the man and the system and racism holding him down
[7/18/17, 2:00:54 PM] Launchpad: you should come down to San Diego.  No one gives a shit about race, we all eat tacos and have a great time
[7/18/17, 2:01:25 PM] Miller: no one cares about race? your football team just moved cities to avoid signing kapernick, explain that
[7/18/17, 2:21:55 PM] Miller: http://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-closes-restaurant-where-customers-got-sick-2017-7
[7/18/17, 2:32:20 PM] Justin: Your still really missing the point on the racist element
[7/18/17, 2:33:09 PM] Justin: It's ok if a darkie plays foosball and fills the seats.  But when he starts questioning institutional structures, time to sit down boy.
[7/18/17, 2:35:20 PM] Justin: And the racist fans feel the same way. They don't want to be lectured or told they're racist, which is infinitely more aggregious to them than say Adrian Peterson hitting his kid with a branch
[7/18/17, 2:36:02 PM] Justin: So combined you can make all the arguments you want about his skill, he had slim to no chance of surviving  his protest.
[7/18/17, 2:40:54 PM] Miller: It's ok if a lightie plays foosball and fills the seats.  But when he starts believing in god too much, time to sit down boy.
[7/18/17, 2:42:45 PM] Launchpad: lololol
[7/18/17, 2:44:44 PM] Justin: Keep making that comparison
[7/18/17, 2:44:57 PM] Steve: It's not the same
[7/18/17, 2:44:59 PM] Miller: is it racism that ray rice was blackballed?
[7/18/17, 2:45:00 PM] Steve: Not even close
[7/18/17, 2:45:05 PM] Miller: is everything racism?
[7/18/17, 2:45:15 PM] Steve: It's like scotts bald racist statement yesterday
[7/18/17, 2:45:19 PM] Steve: Stupid
[7/18/17, 2:45:30 PM] Miller: what if kapernick was outspokenly gay and not outspokenly political?
[7/18/17, 2:45:32 PM] Steve: Just plain ignant
[7/18/17, 2:45:36 PM] Justin: I think you answered your own rhetorical question
[7/18/17, 2:45:47 PM] Justin: ...no one said rice was racism
[7/18/17, 2:45:52 PM] Justin: No one said ap was racism
[7/18/17, 2:46:00 PM] Justin: A lot of people are saying this is racism
[7/18/17, 2:46:03 PM] Justin: Shocking I know
[7/18/17, 2:46:05 PM] Miller: its really not complicated, the NFL doesnt want players who have any kind of outspoken views or any kind of distractions (drugs, arrests, beating dogs or people etc...)
[7/18/17, 2:46:19 PM] Justin: The NFL loved tebow
[7/18/17, 2:46:22 PM] Miller: they will tolerate it in certain situations if they think the difference b/w that player and the next man up is significant enough
[7/18/17, 2:46:36 PM] Miller: once that gap narrows they no longer tolerate it
[7/18/17, 2:46:45 PM] Donk: so therefore, in this case, it is about racism
[7/18/17, 2:46:50 PM] Justin: His historically terrible performances they didn't
[7/18/17, 2:46:51 PM] Donk: as he has the ability to be an nfl player
[7/18/17, 2:46:58 PM] Donk: and isnt because of his outspoken stances
[7/18/17, 2:47:07 PM] Justin: Do you remember the broncos that season?
[7/18/17, 2:47:25 PM] Miller: its not racism, do you really think kapernick doesnt have a job b/c he is black?
[7/18/17, 2:47:31 PM] Donk: sorry
[7/18/17, 2:47:33 PM] Justin: No
[7/18/17, 2:47:33 PM] Donk: not racism
[7/18/17, 2:47:34 PM] Miller: b/c that would be racism
[7/18/17, 2:47:35 PM] Donk: i meant his outspoke views
[7/18/17, 2:47:39 PM] Justin: Because what he said
[7/18/17, 2:47:44 PM] Justin: Not because he's black
[7/18/17, 2:48:01 PM] Justin: It's the message not the person. He could be white and blackballed
[7/18/17, 2:48:33 PM] Miller: so guess what if he was outspokenly openly gay and doing the YMCA dance during the national anthem he would have the same kind fo issues
[7/18/17, 2:48:40 PM] Miller: as he would if he abused dogs
[7/18/17, 2:48:42 PM] Miller: or beat his wife
[7/18/17, 2:48:57 PM] Donk: whats your point?
[7/18/17, 2:49:00 PM] Miller: now if he was as good at football as fresh-out-of-jail vick was, he would have a job
[7/18/17, 2:49:02 PM] Steve: He has no point
[7/18/17, 2:49:03 PM] Donk: so then it would be about those issues vs this one
[7/18/17, 2:49:07 PM] Donk: but not about his ability to play the game
[7/18/17, 2:49:12 PM] Steve: He just likes reading what he types
[7/18/17, 2:49:16 PM] Donk: as we can all agree he has enough ability to be on a roster
[7/18/17, 2:49:41 PM] Miller: sure, i never said he didnt, but the issue is he doesnt have enough ability to make it worth it
[7/18/17, 2:49:47 PM] Donk: ok
[7/18/17, 2:49:48 PM] Justin: Yeh I'm not rehashing this again
[7/18/17, 2:49:47 PM] Donk: fine
[7/18/17, 2:49:56 PM] Donk: but it is still about his views and not ability
[7/18/17, 2:50:05 PM] Miller: its clearly both
[7/18/17, 2:50:07 PM] Justin: You can continually develop strawman and nonsensical comparisons.
[7/18/17, 2:50:08 PM] Donk: its not both
[7/18/17, 2:50:12 PM] Miller: if he had one or the other he would be fine
[7/18/17, 2:50:23 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 2:50:26 PM] Miller: you either need to be good enough to withstand being labeled a distraction
[7/18/17, 2:50:31 PM] Steve: He has one
[7/18/17, 2:50:33 PM] Donk: i cant do this anymore
[7/18/17, 2:50:34 PM] Steve: The ability
[7/18/17, 2:50:34 PM] Miller: or be okay enough and be "clean cut"
[7/18/17, 2:50:38 PM] Steve: You just said that
[7/18/17, 2:50:41 PM] Donk: i dnot understand how you still think its both
[7/18/17, 2:50:49 PM] Steve: Right there
[7/18/17, 2:51:16 PM] Miller: so if aaron rodgers did this you all believe he would be a FA and not have a job?
[7/18/17, 2:51:21 PM] Miller: did the exact same things as kapernick
[7/18/17, 2:51:25 PM] Steve: Here comes his boo, watch out boys
[7/18/17, 2:51:27 PM] Miller: b/c if not, then clearly it is about ability
[7/18/17, 2:51:29 PM] Justin: Yet you continue to argue he isn't good enough to be a backup
[7/18/17, 2:51:39 PM] Justin: As if that has any relation to the other argument.
[7/18/17, 2:51:53 PM] Justin: Ou just keep growing darts trying to find an excuse other than the obvious
[7/18/17, 2:51:57 PM] Justin: Throwing *
[7/18/17, 2:52:02 PM] Miller: no i argue from a football perspective he isnt the right fit as a backup for a lot of teams
[7/18/17, 2:52:05 PM] Dan Watts: If kaepernick had a legitimate racial discrimination case he'd sue the NFL
[7/18/17, 2:52:20 PM] Dan Watts: But there couldn't be a worse more frivolous case
[7/18/17, 2:52:23 PM] Miller: and yes he probably could get a job somewhere if it wasnt for his political issues, but no team thinks he is worth it b/c he isnt good enough
[7/18/17, 2:52:27 PM] Steve: Why would he sue the league he wants to play for?
[7/18/17, 2:52:28 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 2:52:29 PM] Justin: Why
[7/18/17, 2:52:34 PM] Justin: It's private organization
[7/18/17, 2:52:38 PM] Dan Watts: So what
[7/18/17, 2:52:41 PM] Justin: What case could he ha e
[7/18/17, 2:52:43 PM] Steve: So what?
[7/18/17, 2:52:55 PM] Steve: So would you sue an employer you still want to work for?
[7/18/17, 2:53:08 PM] Miller: good, i want you all with a straight face to tell me if aaron rodgers knelt during the anthem he would be an unsigned FA today
[7/18/17, 2:53:08 PM] Steve: Or would that hurt your chances more?
[7/18/17, 2:53:12 PM] Miller: thats a joke
[7/18/17, 2:53:19 PM] Dan Watts: Private organizations can't discriminate by race, religion national original either
[7/18/17, 2:53:36 PM] Steve: But you have to prove that
[7/18/17, 2:53:42 PM] Dan Watts: Yes exactly
[7/18/17, 2:53:44 PM] Steve: Albeit less burden of proof in court
[7/18/17, 2:53:52 PM] Steve: *civil court
[7/18/17, 2:54:00 PM] Steve: But it still doesn't mean it's not happening lol
[7/18/17, 2:54:10 PM] Steve: Guys, he isn't suing means it isn't happening
[7/18/17, 2:54:14 PM] Dan Watts: So if he can't prove he's being discriminated against why do you think you can prove to us he's been discriminated against
[7/18/17, 2:54:16 PM] Steve: #wattslogic
[7/18/17, 2:54:17 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 2:54:24 PM] Steve: I'm not trying to prove shit
[7/18/17, 2:54:27 PM] Steve: It's obvious
[7/18/17, 2:54:28 PM] Justin: Also not sure if that's true
[7/18/17, 2:54:33 PM] Dan Watts: It's not obvious
[7/18/17, 2:54:34 PM] Steve: You three schmucks just see it your way
[7/18/17, 2:54:44 PM] Dan Watts: Again with name calling
[7/18/17, 2:54:44 PM] Launchpad: lolol got em!
[7/18/17, 2:54:44 PM] Justin: Would assume NFL probably licensed in a very legally unregulated state
[7/18/17, 2:54:44 PM] Steve: Per usual
[7/18/17, 2:54:59 PM] Steve: LP, sit down
[7/18/17, 2:55:11 PM] Steve: Sorry watts
[7/18/17, 2:55:43 PM] Steve: Don't want to make you upset again
[7/18/17, 2:55:57 PM] Steve: I'll refrain from name calling in your presence
[7/18/17, 2:56:56 PM] Justin: Also just like him filing a case wouldn't prove it's racism not filing doesn't disprove it
[7/18/17, 2:57:07 PM] Miller: now its back to racism?
[7/18/17, 2:57:08 PM] Miller: i cant keep up
[7/18/17, 2:57:18 PM] Miller: 2 minutes ago you all conceded it was not racism
[7/18/17, 2:57:28 PM] Justin: I never conceded that.
[7/18/17, 2:57:42 PM] Justin: Also would assume an employer could fire you for expressing your beliefs
[7/18/17, 2:57:47 PM] Miller: you just said its not b/c hes black
[7/18/17, 2:57:47 PM] Steve: It's based on him standing up for social injustices that black people face in America
[7/18/17, 2:57:51 PM] Steve: It's always been that
[7/18/17, 2:57:51 PM] Miller: do you even racism bro?
[7/18/17, 2:57:58 PM] Miller: like do we know the definition of racism?
[7/18/17, 2:58:06 PM] Justin: Ok you are very confused
[7/18/17, 2:58:11 PM] Steve: @16195657200 does not
[7/18/17, 2:58:14 PM] Justin: He's talking about instituionlized racism
[7/18/17, 2:58:14 PM] Miller: please enlighten me
[7/18/17, 2:58:19 PM] Steve: See yesterday's convo for further proof
[7/18/17, 2:58:20 PM] Justin: People are angry about that
[7/18/17, 2:58:25 PM] Miller: rac¬∑ism
ÀàrƒÅÀåsiz…ôm/Submit
noun
prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.
[7/18/17, 2:58:30 PM] Justin: It's not complicated
[7/18/17, 2:58:54 PM] Miller: so you talk about racism
[7/18/17, 2:58:56 PM] Miller: cheese doesnt hire you
[7/18/17, 2:58:58 PM] Miller: is that racism?
[7/18/17, 2:59:14 PM] Donk: thats payism
[7/18/17, 2:59:15 PM] Steve: Institutional racism (also known as institutionalized racism) is a form of racism expressed in the practice of social and political institutions.
[7/18/17, 2:59:19 PM] Justin: Is the reason he didn't hire me because racism?
[7/18/17, 2:59:20 PM] Miller: b/c i thought racism actually involved being discriminated against b/c of your actual race
[7/18/17, 2:59:34 PM] Steve: Crazy miller the all powerful only thinks there is only one form of racism
[7/18/17, 2:59:55 PM] Steve: Miller rules: you aren't in the KkK, not racist.
[7/18/17, 2:59:57 PM] Launchpad: Michael Bennett still got a job...
[7/18/17, 3:00:00 PM] Justin: I'm not saying he's not getting a job because he's black
[7/18/17, 3:00:11 PM] Miller: so then what merit would he have to sue based on racism?
[7/18/17, 3:00:16 PM] Steve: He has a contract that he didn't opt out of
[7/18/17, 3:00:22 PM] Miller: which is literally him not getting a job b/c hes black
[7/18/17, 3:00:32 PM] Steve: And if they cut him it would cost them money
[7/18/17, 3:00:35 PM] Steve: Very basic
[7/18/17, 3:00:36 PM] Justin: I never said he did it was watts comin in with  that.
[7/18/17, 3:00:44 PM] Steve: Kap opted out
[7/18/17, 3:00:46 PM] Miller: also michael bennett is actually good at football
[7/18/17, 3:00:47 PM] Miller: so theres that
[7/18/17, 3:00:53 PM] Steve: And so is kap
[7/18/17, 3:01:00 PM] Steve: Or did you already forget your admission?
[7/18/17, 3:01:03 PM] Miller: according to you
[7/18/17, 3:01:04 PM] Steve: Let me get that for you
[7/18/17, 3:01:12 PM] Miller: being better than me at football doesnt make you #good
[7/18/17, 3:01:35 PM] Steve: Again
[7/18/17, 3:01:53 PM] Miller: is that same as michael bennett?
[7/18/17, 3:01:58 PM] Miller: who essentially an all pro?
[7/18/17, 3:02:12 PM] Miller: if michael bennett was borderline roster bubble and was his same outspoken self he would also not have a job
[7/18/17, 3:02:56 PM] Miller: and we can rehash this in a couple yrs when michael bennett is a FA and cannot find a job b/c hes no longer good enough for teams to want to deal w/his distractions
[7/18/17, 3:03:06 PM] Miller: and you can all cry racism again
[7/18/17, 3:03:09 PM] Miller: and we can rinse and repeat
[7/18/17, 3:03:20 PM] Steve: We won't because these are different cases
[7/18/17, 3:03:22 PM] Steve: Again
[7/18/17, 3:03:25 PM] Justin: Lol again
[7/18/17, 3:03:28 PM] Steve: You bringing up things hat aren't the same
[7/18/17, 3:03:32 PM] Justin: I don't even have an idea what beenet has said
[7/18/17, 3:03:50 PM] Justin: And you think it's comparable to 24/7 news coverage of kap protest
[7/18/17, 3:03:56 PM] Steve: He certainly didn't kneel for the anthem
[7/18/17, 3:04:03 PM] Steve: Which is what kap did
[7/18/17, 3:04:11 PM] Justin: I'm sure CNN has run prices on Bennett
[7/18/17, 3:04:11 PM] Miller: so did plenty of other players
[7/18/17, 3:04:13 PM] Miller: and they have jobs
[7/18/17, 3:04:17 PM] Steve: And certainly wasn't vilified for his word like kap
[7/18/17, 3:04:22 PM] Justin: Pieces
[7/18/17, 3:04:58 PM] Steve: Want to tell us how there is only one type of racism again guru?
[7/18/17, 3:05:06 PM] Steve: Or you want to step back on that one?
[7/18/17, 3:05:24 PM] Miller: i honestly dont even know what youre talking about
[7/18/17, 3:05:43 PM] Miller: if you think you can sue a private organization for institutionalized racism then just lol
[7/18/17, 3:05:46 PM] Steve: This?
[7/18/17, 3:05:49 PM] Justin: Yeh I don't think people are arguing kap can't get a job because he's black.
[7/18/17, 3:05:59 PM] Miller: ........then it isnt racism
[7/18/17, 3:06:05 PM] Steve: Defining racism like there is just one kind
[7/18/17, 3:06:07 PM] Steve: That's lol
[7/18/17, 3:06:11 PM] Justin: It's because his protest and speaking of racism
[7/18/17, 3:06:15 PM] Steve: And sad
[7/18/17, 3:06:28 PM] Miller: its literally the definition of racism according to the english language
[7/18/17, 3:06:32 PM] Miller: youre free to disagree with it
[7/18/17, 3:06:34 PM] Justin: Talking about that shot Is equivalent to being a communist
[7/18/17, 3:06:37 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 3:06:47 PM] Miller: i know its fun to say everything is racism
[7/18/17, 3:06:50 PM] Justin: Ask watts about blm and you can see the vilification
[7/18/17, 3:06:52 PM] Launchpad: so if he was protesting for the ethical treatment of animals would he have a job?
[7/18/17, 3:06:56 PM] Steve: I'm not saying that either
[7/18/17, 3:07:01 PM] Miller: someone trying to frame zeke for punching someone?
[7/18/17, 3:07:02 PM] Miller: racism
[7/18/17, 3:07:08 PM] Justin: Yes he would have a job
[7/18/17, 3:07:07 PM] Steve: I am defending this one instance
[7/18/17, 3:07:12 PM] Launchpad: or just a forbidden cause?
[7/18/17, 3:07:13 PM] Steve: Not every single thing
[7/18/17, 3:07:34 PM] Justin: Clearly that issue which is the point - that issue is why he doesn't have a job
[7/18/17, 3:07:47 PM] Launchpad: So basically the only reason why he doesn't have a job is because of the specific cause he supports....nothing else
[7/18/17, 3:07:55 PM] Steve: Again, crazy tangents of things no one said or inferred
[7/18/17, 3:08:00 PM] Justin: Now should teams give him a job with that baggage, I don't fucken know that's up to the team.
[7/18/17, 3:08:09 PM] Miller: DONT CALL IT BAGGAGE
[7/18/17, 3:08:11 PM] Miller: THATS RACIST
[7/18/17, 3:08:13 PM] Justin: But denying that it's the major cause is beyond stupid
[7/18/17, 3:08:36 PM] Miller: well quantifying what % of the cause it is seems impossible
[7/18/17, 3:08:39 PM] Steve: It's beyond stupid that we are still arguing with these theee
[7/18/17, 3:08:41 PM] Miller: something i am open to admitting
[7/18/17, 3:08:42 PM] Steve: *three
[7/18/17, 3:08:46 PM] Steve: We are the idiots
[7/18/17, 3:08:50 PM] Miller: but you guys all insist it is THE major cause
[7/18/17, 3:08:55 PM] Steve: They just keep saying the same things
[7/18/17, 3:09:54 PM] Miller: im looking at the facts objectively, kapernick is a FA, kapernick had outspoken political views, kapernick is not very good at football, and he does not fit the traditional mold of a backup QB
[7/18/17, 3:10:08 PM] Miller: so now what % of why is he a FA is due to his politics and what % is due to football? i dont know
[7/18/17, 3:10:30 PM] Justin: Major is a simple answer. Would he have a job minus protest ?
[7/18/17, 3:10:43 PM] Miller: possibly, not 100% sure
[7/18/17, 3:10:50 PM] Steve: 80/20
[7/18/17, 3:10:52 PM] Justin: Every single writeup on his incomin free agency indicates yes
[7/18/17, 3:10:57 PM] Miller: but the back half of NFL backups are pretty replacable
[7/18/17, 3:11:21 PM] Justin: Go back to 2015 discussion of trade talks and impending free agency
[7/18/17, 3:11:32 PM] Miller: but explain to me why you think that solves the answer
[7/18/17, 3:11:44 PM] Miller: would he have a job if he was as good as rodgers or brady or even eli or rivers?
[7/18/17, 3:11:57 PM] Miller: in that case then his talent is the major reason
[7/18/17, 3:12:04 PM] Miller: see it works both ways
[7/18/17, 3:12:14 PM] Justin: Because those articles are written after talking to front office guys
[7/18/17, 3:12:19 PM] Justin: And a lot of teams wanted him
[7/18/17, 3:12:28 PM] Steve: I believe he wouldn't
[7/18/17, 3:12:31 PM] Miller: can you not understand he was literally a different player then?
[7/18/17, 3:12:39 PM] Justin: All of a sudden they don't. You claim because of advanced statistics- as if those weren't around in 2015
[7/18/17, 3:12:40 PM] Miller: like this is the NFL
[7/18/17, 3:12:43 PM] Miller: shit changes and changes fast
[7/18/17, 3:12:46 PM] Miller: he had surgery
[7/18/17, 3:12:49 PM] Miller: lost all his arm strength
[7/18/17, 3:12:59 PM] Steve: I believe if he was adamant as kap was and obviously those guys would then also be black
[7/18/17, 3:12:59 PM] Miller: he was running a gimmick offense that teams figured out
[7/18/17, 3:13:01 PM] Justin: And he had like a 16-2 td int ratio
[7/18/17, 3:13:02 PM] Steve: They wouldn't have jobs
[7/18/17, 3:13:25 PM] Justin: So couldn't have hurt his arm strength all that much
[7/18/17, 3:13:36 PM] Miller: @16316620763 you realize there is more to analysis then just looking at box scores or fantasy stats?
[7/18/17, 3:13:43 PM] Miller: like give me a break
[7/18/17, 3:13:47 PM] Miller: matt flynn threw 7 TDs in one game
[7/18/17, 3:13:47 PM] Miller: great
[7/18/17, 3:14:16 PM] Miller: go please get NFL rewind and objectively break down all of kaps games and tell me hes a good QB and makes good reads and doesnt miss guys etc...
[7/18/17, 3:14:36 PM] Miller: please put some more respek on teams talent evaluations
[7/18/17, 3:14:38 PM] Miller: its not madden
[7/18/17, 3:14:57 PM] Miller: tebow finished like QB7 in fantasy as a starter, does that make him a good QB
[7/18/17, 3:15:42 PM] Dan Watts: tebow was better than many starters, thats because the league is anti- white christian
[7/18/17, 3:16:03 PM] Dan Watts: the league is anti-white christian AND racist
[7/18/17, 3:17:05 PM] Miller: Inside the NFL, this is where 90% of the discussion about Kaepernick begins and ends. Playing from the pocket is not a quarterbacking attribute; it‚Äôs a prerequisite. If a team‚Äôs QB can‚Äôt play from the pocket, the vast majority of the play designs won‚Äôt work. Coaches can‚Äôt draw up plays that call for the quarterback to break down, run around and hopefully find an open guy. Today‚Äôs defenses are too good for that.

Is Kaepernick capable of dropping back and releasing the ball at the top of his drop? Sure, but usually only when the play design has an either/or read‚Äîwhen Kaepernick has just one or two receivers to consider and doesn‚Äôt have to read the entire field or full coverage. But even on these, Kaepernick tends to get off track in his dropback with unsettling regularity. He‚Äôll move needlessly, creating pressure that wouldn‚Äôt have existed. Or at the very least, his needless movement will get him out of sync with the timing of his receivers‚Äô routes.

Also, when Kaepernick moves, he ceases to be a throwing threat. Watch Tom Brady‚Äîhe moves with subtly and nuance, his eyes stay downfield and he almost never sacrifices his readiness to throw. Watch Aaron Rodgers‚Äîhe moves a lot, sometimes unnecessarily, but he never sacrifices his readiness to throw. Stylistically, most NFL starters are like this. (The Bradys and Rodgerses of the world, of course, do it at a much higher level.)

Kaepernick, on the other hand, brings the ball down, gets out of his throwing stance, takes his eyes to the pass rush and immediately assumes a runner‚Äôs mindset. Sometimes after this, he‚Äôll try to go back into a passer‚Äôs mindset, which means taking his eyes back to the field and spontaneously reevaluating a defensive look that has now changed and that he hadn‚Äôt fully processed in the first place.

Imagine playing wide receiver with a quarterback like this. Or blocking for that guy. You have no chance at establishing rhythm. The timing and detail that you‚Äôve practiced over and over goes out the window.

Exacerbating matters, Kaepernick is not a proficient passer on the move. A coach of his once told me, ‚ÄúHe only has one club in his golf bag.‚Äù What the coach meant was Kaepernick can throw fastballs, but only fastballs. When he nails those, they look as good as anything you‚Äôll see. His arm can be incredible. But touch passes? Anticipation passes? They‚Äôre not in his bag.

Kaepernick is a talented athlete. (Though it‚Äôs worth noting that his athleticism was significantly diminished by rapid weight loss last offseason. Teams are surely wondering whether he‚Äôll ever recapture it.) But he‚Äôs not a talented quarterback. His weaknesses happen to be the very weaknesses that an NFL quarterback can least afford to have.
[7/18/17, 3:17:45 PM] Miller: but you and steve probably know better, after all you did check a box score
[7/18/17, 3:17:46 PM] Dan Watts: RACIST analysis
[7/18/17, 3:18:19 PM] Steve: We know nothing and do nothing we known
[7/18/17, 3:18:25 PM] Steve: You scott and watts know it all
[7/18/17, 3:18:30 PM] Steve: Racism doesn't exist
[7/18/17, 3:18:37 PM] Steve: It is a made up thing by liberals
[7/18/17, 3:18:41 PM] Steve: And we are all snowflakes
[7/18/17, 3:18:44 PM] Steve: We get it
[7/18/17, 3:18:47 PM] Steve: Don't care
[7/18/17, 3:18:48 PM] Miller: see i dont have enough hubris to think i am better at evaluating talent than nfl coaches and executives
[7/18/17, 3:19:22 PM] Steve: But you have enough hubris to know everything all the time when it comes to us lol
[7/18/17, 3:19:29 PM] Steve: Get the fuck outta here
[7/18/17, 3:19:34 PM] Steve: With your fake ass humility
[7/18/17, 3:20:27 PM] Steve: Miller humble = fake news
[7/18/17, 3:20:46 PM] Miller: im not sure why you are incapable of having a discussion about literally anything w/o resorting to personal insults
[7/18/17, 3:21:03 PM] Steve: BecUse you are lecturing me
[7/18/17, 3:21:04 PM] Steve: Always
[7/18/17, 3:21:18 PM] Steve: Sorry if I have a dad already and don't always need to be lectured
[7/18/17, 3:21:37 PM] Miller: well i would hope you dont speak to your dad that way
[7/18/17, 3:21:44 PM] Miller: and also i have no idea what you are talking about, as usual
[7/18/17, 3:21:47 PM] Steve: That he isn't humble?
[7/18/17, 3:21:48 PM] Steve: Lol
[7/18/17, 3:21:55 PM] Steve: If he wasn't I'd probably point it or
[7/18/17, 3:23:01 PM] Launchpad: I never said that.  However, it is largely correlated to education and income levels.  Have nots who blame others for their own lives failures.   Does racism exist in the upper middle class?  Sure, but no where close to near the levels it does in people who are of a lower socio economical status
[7/18/17, 3:23:15 PM] Donk: oh i think you do. perine was taken in the 4th round of the nfl draft, and you took him in our rookie draft above many rbs taken higher than him lol
[7/18/17, 3:23:31 PM] Launchpad: Arrogant Miller
[7/18/17, 3:23:37 PM] Steve: Don't question him being humble
[7/18/17, 3:23:44 PM] Miller: fanstasy is different than real life, every fantasy "expert" ranks him where i took him
[7/18/17, 3:23:45 PM] Donk: so much hubris
[7/18/17, 3:23:45 PM] Steve: That's a personal insult
[7/18/17, 3:23:50 PM] Miller: b/c in fantasy opportunity > talent
[7/18/17, 3:23:57 PM] Miller: much like why herman thinks kapernick is good
[7/18/17, 3:24:04 PM] Miller: b/c he had him on his fantasy team
[7/18/17, 3:24:10 PM] Steve: Says the guy who accused me of raping women
[7/18/17, 3:24:19 PM] Steve: But I hurl personal insults
[7/18/17, 3:24:22 PM] Steve: What a joke
[7/18/17, 3:24:36 PM] Donk: haha, i know,
[7/18/17, 3:24:39 PM] Donk: just thought it was funny
[7/18/17, 3:24:45 PM] Miller: you accused someone of rape for having sex with a drunk woman
[7/18/17, 3:24:55 PM] Miller: or having sex with an underage woman who had lied to him
[7/18/17, 3:24:58 PM] Steve: Of an unconscious woman
[7/18/17, 3:24:59 PM] Steve: Yup
[7/18/17, 3:25:14 PM] Steve: That's sexual assault still
[7/18/17, 3:25:20 PM] Miller: so i was asking if you had done either of those things
[7/18/17, 3:25:24 PM] Steve: Then you accused me of doing that
[7/18/17, 3:25:32 PM] Donk: the underage woman who lied to you about her age is one of the toughest things to reconcile imo
[7/18/17, 3:25:36 PM] Donk: i see it from so many sides
[7/18/17, 3:25:40 PM] Steve: But keep getting butt hurt because I said your not humble
[7/18/17, 3:25:43 PM] Donk: thats what they got LT on
[7/18/17, 3:26:00 PM] Miller: if you have never had sex w/anyone who is drunk or had sex w/anyone who is not under age b/c you got a full authorized check of their birth certificate then you have nothing to worry about
[7/18/17, 3:26:06 PM] Miller: you would not fit your definition
[7/18/17, 3:26:23 PM] Steve: Right but that's not what you said
[7/18/17, 3:26:26 PM] Miller: if not then you are the only one calling yourself a rapist
[7/18/17, 3:26:28 PM] Steve: You accused
[7/18/17, 3:26:31 PM] Miller: b/c that is not my definition of rape
[7/18/17, 3:26:44 PM] Steve: Great
[7/18/17, 3:28:10 PM] Miller: are you possibly suggesting there are grey areas and everything is not black and white?
[7/18/17, 3:28:46 PM] Donk: haha, for everything except the kapernick situation
[7/18/17, 3:28:47 PM] Donk: that is black and white
[7/18/17, 3:28:52 PM] Donk: its because of his views
[7/18/17, 4:01:22 PM] Dan Watts: "I don't think Colin Kaepernick has been signed because of his performance on the field the last 2 years"
[7/18/17, 4:01:40 PM] Dan Watts: ~MICHAEL VICK 7/17/17
[7/18/17, 4:01:56 PM] Donk: michael vicks comments were ridiculous
[7/18/17, 4:02:08 PM] Donk: esp the whole haircutting thing
[7/18/17, 4:02:32 PM] Dan Watts: criticize the Kaepernick? UNCLE TOM!!!
[7/18/17, 4:03:12 PM] Donk: telling black people to cut their hair for a better image has so many racial undertones
[7/18/17, 4:03:55 PM] Miller: kind of funny to have an ex con giving kapernick job interview advice
[7/18/17, 4:03:55 PM] Donk: and who called vick an uncle tom?
[7/18/17, 4:04:07 PM] Donk: exactly
[7/18/17, 4:04:14 PM] Miller: he kind of back tracked on the hair cutting stuff but it didnt make a lot of sense
[7/18/17, 4:05:00 PM] Dan Watts: because he made the hair comment his critcisim of his on the field play is less valid?
[7/18/17, 4:05:25 PM] Donk: because of the hair comments it basically negates everything he said in that interview to be honest
[7/18/17, 4:05:36 PM] Miller: who you gonna trust to evaluate a QB? michael vick or herman? cmon watts be real here
[7/18/17, 4:07:08 PM] Dan Watts: definitely deferring to the opinion of the all-pro would be unfair i know
[7/18/17, 4:07:42 PM] Donk: i dont think vick was ever an allpro fwiw
[7/18/17, 4:07:53 PM] Donk: pro-bowler for sure, but i doubt he was ever all-pro
[7/18/17, 4:09:09 PM] Miller: kind of surprised he was not in that 2010 season
[7/18/17, 4:09:31 PM] Miller: also didnt realize they only took one QB
[7/18/17, 4:09:31 PM] Miller: nevermind then
[7/18/17, 4:09:51 PM] Miller: not sure why there is no QB on the 2nd team all pro
[7/18/17, 4:09:55 PM] Dan Watts: ok sorry- opinion of the pro-bowler*
[7/18/17, 4:11:11 PM] Donk: so do you also listen to curt schillings opinions on things like immigration because he was an all-star a bunch of times?
[7/18/17, 4:11:36 PM] Miller: as much of a dbag as he is i would still trust his evaluation of pitchers
[7/18/17, 4:12:06 PM] Miller: im sure he knows a shitload about pitching
[7/18/17, 4:12:06 PM] Dan Watts: yes
[7/18/17, 4:12:25 PM] Donk: even if his evaluation included comments about a hispanic player shouldnt celebrate as much?
[7/18/17, 4:12:29 PM] Dan Watts: his evaluations on pitchers not immigration
[7/18/17, 4:12:36 PM] Donk: or would you dismiss it as typical schiulling bullshit
[7/18/17, 4:12:58 PM] Donk: also, michael vick was such a mediocre qb, hes not anywhere close to the level schilling was as a pitcher
[7/18/17, 4:13:13 PM] Miller: nobody is saying otherwise?
[7/18/17, 4:13:19 PM] Miller: schilling a 1st ballot HOFer
[7/18/17, 4:13:26 PM] Donk: most electryfing athelte in nfl history? maybe
[7/18/17, 4:13:31 PM] Donk: but overall mediocre qb? yes
[7/18/17, 4:13:37 PM] Miller: vick was largely underhwleming as a QB
[7/18/17, 4:14:16 PM] Miller: but yes i still would trust the opinion of any professional qb or coach or scout even prof nfl analyst over someone like me or herman
[7/18/17, 4:14:26 PM] Launchpad: I'm pretty sure everyone on the planet is guilty of making a stupid comment so that pretty much invalidates all comments on everything, ever
[7/18/17, 4:14:36 PM] Donk: i didnt say ever
[7/18/17, 4:14:39 PM] Donk: i said in that interview
[7/18/17, 4:14:56 PM] Donk: im dismissing 1 interviews worth of comments
[7/18/17, 4:15:37 PM] Miller: not sure what vick has to gain or why he would lie about that
[7/18/17, 4:15:49 PM] Miller: i have no reason to not trust he believes that he said
[7/18/17, 4:15:59 PM] Donk: vick also thinks kap needs a life coach which is also laughable
[7/18/17, 4:16:12 PM] Donk: oh, i beleive that he thinks that
[7/18/17, 4:16:26 PM] Donk: i personally think hes wrong
[7/18/17, 4:17:02 PM] Launchpad: i feel like a lot of people in this chat could benefit from having a life coach...
[7/18/17, 4:17:34 PM] Miller: is tim ferrett available?
[7/18/17, 4:17:39 PM] Donk: but the main point here, is that watts mentions 1 part of the interview about michael vick of all peopel thinking hes a bad qb, and dosnt even mention the hair comment, or life coach thing, or any of the other ignorant things that vick said
[7/18/17, 4:17:41 PM] Donk: "The first thing we got to get Colin to do is cut his hair," Vick said of Kaepernick. "Listen, I'm not up here to try to be politically correct, but even if he puts cornrows in it, I don't think he should represent himself in that way in terms of just a hairstyle. Just go clean cut. Why not? You're already dealing with a lot of controversy surrounding this issue. What he needs to do is just try to be presentable."
[7/18/17, 4:17:48 PM] Miller: does he do online life coaching? $49.99/week?
[7/18/17, 4:18:31 PM] Dan Watts: vick ditched his cornrows and sought guidance from tony dungy
[7/18/17, 4:18:36 PM] Dan Watts: to get back in the league
[7/18/17, 4:18:41 PM] Miller: yes but he also said "‚ÄúHe is a great kid and the reason he's not playing has nothing to do with the national anthem,‚Äù Vick said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more solely on his play" so why is the other stuff relevant?
[7/18/17, 4:18:44 PM] Donk: Vick was a convicted felon at the time
[7/18/17, 4:18:58 PM] Donk: and tony dungy is also the worst, but thats besides the point
[7/18/17, 4:19:11 PM] Dan Watts: i agree, but he acknowledged he had an image problem
[7/18/17, 4:19:26 PM] Dan Watts: he's saying it because that worked for him
[7/18/17, 4:19:46 PM] Miller: someone mail kapernick a copy of the 4 hour work week
[7/18/17, 4:20:18 PM] Donk: vick clearly doesnt understand the history behind telling a black man that he has to cut his hair to look more presntable
[7/18/17, 4:20:39 PM] Miller: oh man
[7/18/17, 4:20:45 PM] Donk: at best its an ignorant comment from it, at worst its basically racist
[7/18/17, 4:20:50 PM] Miller: is it possible cheese didnt hire herman b/c he didnt cut his hair?
[7/18/17, 4:20:53 PM] Miller: maybe it wasnt racism
[7/18/17, 4:21:35 PM] Donk: i thought that cheese did offer herman a job and herman turned it down?
[7/18/17, 4:22:13 PM] Miller: idk about the racist overtones or not but if someone who was white and had like dreadlocks or long unkempt hair asked me for my opinion before going on an interview i would tell them to cut their hair
[7/18/17, 4:23:00 PM] Launchpad: Yankees made jonny damon cut his hair... racist organization
[7/18/17, 4:23:25 PM] Donk: wasnt there a player recently who said he didnt sign with the yankees because he didnt want to have to shave before everygame?
[7/18/17, 4:23:45 PM] Miller: doesnt ring any bells, i know clint frazier was pisssed
[7/18/17, 5:08:51 PM] Justin: lol there irony all over the place here
[7/18/17, 5:09:53 PM] Justin: if you think the media, or watts for that matter, highlights that comment because michael vick was a qb...iv got a bridge to sell you
[7/18/17, 5:10:32 PM] Launchpad: https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-claps-back-at-mike-vick-after-being-told-to-cut-his-hair/
[7/18/17, 5:10:48 PM] Launchpad: sounds like Herman is running CP's twitter
[7/18/17, 5:12:32 PM] Dan Watts: i don't know what this means
[7/18/17, 5:13:37 PM] Launchpad: To be fair....has there been any QBs to say that CP should have a job?
[7/18/17, 5:13:52 PM] Justin: and flip the question
[7/18/17, 5:14:30 PM] Dan Watts: pete carrol said he should be in the league, then proceeded to pass on CP
[7/18/17, 5:14:40 PM] Justin: i mean the fact taht a black athlete is saying its performance related ims rue has nothing to do with anything
[7/18/17, 5:14:42 PM] Dan Watts: CK*
[7/18/17, 5:15:02 PM] Justin: im not approaching it form michael vick is an uncle tom
[7/18/17, 5:15:20 PM] Dan Watts: i'm going to take the opinion of a professional who was recently in the league
[7/18/17, 5:15:25 PM] Dan Watts: rather than you or shaun king
[7/18/17, 5:15:31 PM] Dan Watts: sorry im not sorry
[7/18/17, 5:15:34 PM] Justin: thats fine
[7/18/17, 5:15:53 PM] Launchpad: Interesting...because my thoughts were not that a Black QB gave his opinion about CP, just that a former QB said that
[7/18/17, 5:16:31 PM] Justin: ok so perhaps you arent racist
[7/18/17, 5:16:43 PM] Justin: perhaps you are irrelevant- it justifies people that are racist
[7/18/17, 5:17:24 PM] Justin: hence the media, an organization that runs on profit, willim sure run with it...im sure breitbart and almost all right wing outlets will as well
[7/18/17, 5:19:30 PM] Justin: so would vick have a job?
[7/18/17, 5:19:42 PM] Justin: if he spoke out like kap?
[7/18/17, 5:19:56 PM] Dan Watts: now, no, 6 years ago yes
[7/18/17, 5:20:26 PM] Launchpad: before prison yes, definitely not after prison
[7/18/17, 5:20:34 PM] Dan Watts: i think after prison too
[7/18/17, 5:20:41 PM] Launchpad: no way
[7/18/17, 5:20:47 PM] Launchpad: he was already a big liability
[7/18/17, 5:21:13 PM] Launchpad: he made it back because he was on his best behavior
[7/18/17, 5:21:20 PM] Dan Watts: after that 2010 season? he could protest naked
[7/18/17, 5:21:40 PM] Launchpad: maybe after 2010...but not right after prison
[7/18/17, 5:22:28 PM] Dan Watts: yeah it would be more difficult for sure, but it all boils down to the same fundamental point- that talent is the superceding factor
[7/18/17, 5:23:18 PM] Justin: tythats funny---maybe @15166335046 miller should look at vicks advanced statistics
[7/18/17, 5:23:33 PM] Justin: 2 seasons above average
[7/18/17, 5:23:43 PM] Justin: 2002, 2010
[7/18/17, 5:23:45 PM] Dan Watts: the guy made 4 pro bowls
[7/18/17, 5:23:47 PM] Justin: thats it
[7/18/17, 5:23:55 PM] Justin: oh so now were looking at real stats again?
[7/18/17, 5:24:18 PM] Justin: 16-4 td int ratio
[7/18/17, 5:24:28 PM] Miller: 6 years ago vick was one of the best QBs in the NFL
[7/18/17, 5:24:31 PM] Miller: hence why he got the shot he did
[7/18/17, 5:24:39 PM] Justin: ok so looka t his advanced stats then
[7/18/17, 5:24:45 PM] Dan Watts: how many pro bowls kap make? 0?
[7/18/17, 5:24:52 PM] Justin: thats yuour argument against cap and you just sunk that arguement
[7/18/17, 5:25:09 PM] Dan Watts: what concerns me about those in the "it has to be racism camp" is that there is literally no amount of evidecne to the contrary can persuade them to the contrary
[7/18/17, 5:25:11 PM] Justin: his rate + was nearly identical to kap
[7/18/17, 5:25:12 PM] Miller: i dont have PFF gold
[7/18/17, 5:25:14 PM] Justin: a little lower overall
[7/18/17, 5:25:16 PM] Miller: you go look at his advanced stats
[7/18/17, 5:25:22 PM] Justin: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/V/VickMi00.htm#all_passing_advanced
[7/18/17, 5:25:22 PM] Miller: im sure he was not the 32nd best QB in the NFL
[7/18/17, 5:26:05 PM] Launchpad: he also fit right into the Eagles / McNabb system
[7/18/17, 5:26:11 PM] Launchpad: also a huge factor
[7/18/17, 5:27:00 PM] Miller: dont worry as soon as vick started sucking the NFL was done w/ him also
[7/18/17, 5:27:05 PM] Miller: pretty sure he said last year he still wanted to play
[7/18/17, 5:27:09 PM] Miller: was he blackballed?
[7/18/17, 5:27:11 PM] Dan Watts: yes
[7/18/17, 5:27:20 PM] Dan Watts: he wants to play
[7/18/17, 5:27:27 PM] Justin: vicks sucking was form the get go accoridng to those stats
[7/18/17, 5:27:35 PM] Justin: in fact according to conventional stats as well
[7/18/17, 5:27:35 PM] Miller: and does vicks career as an avg or above or below avg QB have any merit on his ability to better analyze a QBs play than you?
[7/18/17, 5:27:46 PM] Justin: and he averaged 5.1 yd per run
[7/18/17, 5:27:48 PM] Miller: his QB rating was 100 in 2010
[7/18/17, 5:27:54 PM] Miller: so no not according to conventional stats
[7/18/17, 5:27:57 PM] Justin: kap 6.8 last year
[7/18/17, 5:27:59 PM] Justin: .......next
[7/18/17, 5:28:24 PM] Justin: kaps was 90.7 last year
[7/18/17, 5:28:51 PM] Justin: so your calling kap 90.7 historically bad bottom of league
[7/18/17, 5:28:58 PM] Justin: and vicks 100 good enough to be rodgers
[7/18/17, 5:29:36 PM] Miller: once again
[7/18/17, 5:29:38 PM] Justin: but keep picking and choosing from one article on pff
[7/18/17, 5:29:40 PM] Miller: im not calling him anything
[7/18/17, 5:29:44 PM] Justin: thats great way to make statistical analysis
[7/18/17, 5:29:43 PM] Miller: guys who do this for a living are
[7/18/17, 5:29:50 PM] Miller: i am not a prof nfl scout
[7/18/17, 5:29:53 PM] Miller: and have claimed not to be 100s of times
[7/18/17, 5:30:05 PM] Miller: i am fully willing to admit i watched maybe 6 kapernick plays last yr
[7/18/17, 5:30:19 PM] Miller: you armchair analystys can sit there and tell me how great he is
[7/18/17, 5:30:28 PM] Miller: ill rely on the experts
[7/18/17, 5:30:38 PM] Miller: does that mean vick sucked also? maybe
[7/18/17, 5:30:54 PM] Miller: i dont fucking know, i do know that teams at least thought he was good enough to deal with the backlash from signing him
[7/18/17, 5:31:10 PM] Miller: and if you dont think there was any backlash youre full of shit
[7/18/17, 5:31:22 PM] Miller: but he helped them win
[7/18/17, 5:31:25 PM] Miller: and so all was forgiven
[7/18/17, 5:31:57 PM] Justin: but football outsiders has him as 23rd qb in apssing stats and 1 in rushing
[7/18/17, 5:31:57 PM] Dan Watts: i think vick signed one of the biggest extensions ever at the time following that 2010 season
[7/18/17, 5:32:01 PM] Justin: you ignore those professionals
[7/18/17, 5:32:10 PM] Miller: lol @ "one pff article" that ONE pff article literally graded all the QBs from last yr
[7/18/17, 5:32:12 PM] Miller: what more do you want?
[7/18/17, 5:32:20 PM] Justin: ok http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/qb
[7/18/17, 5:32:31 PM] Justin: heres another group of profesisonals who graded every qb
[7/18/17, 5:32:43 PM] Justin: and they seperated it by passing and rushing
[7/18/17, 5:33:42 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/18/17, 5:34:30 PM] Justin: otal QBR (listed as just QBR) is a metric created by the ESPN Stats & Information group. Total QBR is based on the by the quarterback on each play, then adjusts the numbers to a scale of 0-100. There are five main differences between Total QBR and Football Outsiders' DVOA metric (with further explanation here):
Total QBR incorporates information from game charting, such as passes dropped or thrown away on purpose.
Total QBR splits responsibility on plays between the quarterback, his receivers, and his blockers. Drops, for example, are more on the receiver, as are yards after the catch, and some sacks are more on the offensive line than others.
Total QBR has a clutch factor which adds (or subtracts) value for quarterbacks who perform best (or worst) in high-leverage situations.
Total QBR combines passing and rushing value into one number and differentiates between scrambles and planned runs.
Beginning in 2016, Total QBR is now adjusted for strength of opponent. Total QBR on other stats pages (pre-2016) has not yet been updated with oppponent adjustment. (Note: Other QB stats pages will be updated with adjusted QBR and a qualifying minimum of 200 passes sometime before the end of February.)
[7/18/17, 5:34:51 PM] Miller: The simple version: DYAR means a quarterback with more total value.
[7/18/17, 5:34:53 PM] Miller: simple version
[7/18/17, 5:34:55 PM] Miller: simple
[7/18/17, 5:34:55 PM] Miller: version
[7/18/17, 5:35:05 PM] Miller: so hes the 30th most valuable QB
[7/18/17, 5:35:06 PM] Miller: great
[7/18/17, 5:35:07 PM] Miller: next?
[7/18/17, 5:35:43 PM] Justin: by that stnadard flacco is 29th
[7/18/17, 5:35:52 PM] Miller: okay
[7/18/17, 5:35:57 PM] Miller: and he probably was
[7/18/17, 5:35:58 PM] Miller: whats the point?
[7/18/17, 5:36:00 PM] Justin: do you envision flacco as 29th qb ?
[7/18/17, 5:36:14 PM] Miller: is this where you just ignore the fact you blew up your own argument?
[7/18/17, 5:36:23 PM] Justin: im going by qbr rating
[7/18/17, 5:36:26 PM] Miller: lol
[7/18/17, 5:36:27 PM] Miller: so yes
[7/18/17, 5:36:39 PM] Justin: sorry espn advanced statistics i suppose are meaningless
[7/18/17, 5:36:46 PM] Miller: so first you want to use advanced stats
[7/18/17, 5:36:52 PM] Miller: then you want to use some BS ESPN metric
[7/18/17, 5:37:00 PM] Miller: bc now the advanced stats dont suit you
[7/18/17, 5:37:09 PM] Justin: its tisll adanced stat
[7/18/17, 5:37:18 PM] Miller: does QBR adjust for defenses played?
[7/18/17, 5:37:19 PM] Miller: nope
[7/18/17, 5:37:37 PM] Justin: Beginning in 2016, Total QBR is now adjusted for strength of opponent. Total QBR on other stats pages (pre-2016) has not yet been updated with oppponent adjustment. (Note: Other QB stats pages will be updated with adjusted QBR and a qualifying minimum of 200 passes sometime before the end of February.)
[7/18/17, 5:37:58 PM] Justin: so yes it does
[7/18/17, 5:38:24 PM] Justin: teh difference is that this doesnt include rushing
[7/18/17, 5:38:35 PM] Justin: rushing advnaced stats hes #1
[7/18/17, 5:39:05 PM] Miller: great, lmk when he is open to switching to RB
[7/18/17, 5:39:11 PM] Justin: so yeh ii mean there is nothing disinegenuous about ignoring that i suppose when siting he is 30th
[7/18/17, 5:39:34 PM] Miller: is but his rushing! the new but her emails!
[7/18/17, 5:39:37 PM] Miller: that is the question
[7/18/17, 5:39:45 PM] Justin: dyar 134 and dvoa 32% on ruhsing
[7/18/17, 5:39:48 PM] Justin: or 1st overlal
[7/18/17, 5:39:48 PM] Miller: hes a quarterback
[7/18/17, 5:39:53 PM] Miller: his job is to throw the football
[7/18/17, 5:39:59 PM] Miller: and everyone agrees he sucked at it last yr
[7/18/17, 5:40:04 PM] Miller: or everyone but you and a few others
[7/18/17, 5:40:11 PM] Justin: well than like i said, vick sucked as well
[7/18/17, 5:40:15 PM] Justin: but vick was a sensation
[7/18/17, 5:40:16 PM] Miller: sounds like a great backup QB
[7/18/17, 5:40:17 PM] Miller: sign me up
[7/18/17, 5:42:24 PM] Justin: . His career interception rate (1.8 percent) is second-best in NFL history to only Aaron Rodgers.
[7/18/17, 5:42:31 PM] Justin: nah tahts terrible die afor backup
[7/18/17, 5:43:44 PM] Miller: and tebow is tied for 15th all time
[7/18/17, 5:43:44 PM] Miller: wow
[7/18/17, 5:43:48 PM] Miller: he must be awesome also
[7/18/17, 5:44:28 PM] Justin: on 350 pass attmepts but fair
[7/18/17, 5:44:39 PM] Miller: cherry picking random stats doesnt make him a good QB
[7/18/17, 5:44:57 PM] Miller: idk why you cannot get over it, 2 completely independent sites ranked him 30th and 32nd in the NFL
[7/18/17, 5:45:01 PM] Justin: dont see tebow on the list though
[7/18/17, 5:45:10 PM] Justin: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_int_perc_career.htm
[7/18/17, 5:45:09 PM] Miller: im sorry hes not good, i really am
[7/18/17, 5:45:18 PM] Miller: doesnt have enough attempts probably
[7/18/17, 5:45:30 PM] Justin: might be 2016 qb only
[7/18/17, 5:45:35 PM] Justin: nah tis not
[7/18/17, 5:45:36 PM] Miller: but he throws so few passes and the ones he does throw are generally so innacurate it doesnt lead to a lot of interceptions
[7/18/17, 5:45:44 PM] Miller: which is probably the same thing for kapernick if i had to guess
[7/18/17, 5:46:02 PM] Miller: if not throwing interceptions was all that mattered alex smith would be a good QB
[7/18/17, 5:46:07 PM] Miller: but its not, and hes not
[7/18/17, 5:46:12 PM] Justin: cap attempts 25 p/g
[7/18/17, 5:46:19 PM] Justin: wouldnt say thats insanely low
[7/18/17, 5:46:36 PM] Justin: that includes games he didnt start was injured, etc
[7/18/17, 5:47:29 PM] Miller: nothing you say is going to change the fact hes not good, you should spend your time working on a time machine so you can go back in time and hire him a QB coach or get him some training or something, its the only thing that will work
[7/18/17, 5:47:45 PM] Justin: fair
[7/18/17, 6:31:58 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/18/17, 6:32:24 PM] Justin: but it be pretty aweosme to see maywehater kicked in the mouth
[7/18/17, 6:32:39 PM] Justin: mkae up for a career of boring fights
[7/18/17, 6:34:41 PM] Miller: Or piss off a lot of people
[7/18/17, 6:34:42 PM] Miller: Imagine paying 100 bucks and McGregor just kicks him in the face in Rd 1
[7/18/17, 6:35:12 PM] Justin: id hope they would write a clause into his contract for fight to prevent that
[7/18/17, 6:38:50 PM] Miller: @16318489683 teaser is out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qab3TMg42k
[7/18/17, 6:41:17 PM] Miller: Lol holy shit the character mark was named after Matt Damon (he thought his name was Mark Damon)
[7/18/17, 6:43:37 PM] Miller: @16318489683 we gotta go see this in theaters
[7/18/17, 8:04:33 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/18/17, 8:07:16 PM] Dan Watts: lol that's awesome
[7/18/17, 9:33:56 PM] Justin: Feel like all this guy needs is a "shop smart shop s mart"
[7/18/17, 9:39:47 PM] Launchpad: and you need to watch Ash vs Evil Dead if you haven't already

[7/19/17, 12:11:03 PM] Miller: bernie fans "you idiots believed those polls that said clinton would beat trump, you are so out of touch and dumb"
also bernie fans "look at this poll that says bernie would beat trump"
[7/19/17, 12:11:16 PM] Miller: if theres one thing polls are known for its accuracy years in advance of potential elections
[7/19/17, 12:12:15 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/16/bernie-s/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-comments-climate-chan/

[7/19/17, 12:21:54 PM] Kiyoon: the Chipotle that served whatever the F virus is the Chipotle right down from my work
[7/19/17, 12:22:01 PM] Kiyoon: good thing I didn't have Chipotle this week
[7/19/17, 12:27:22 PM] Steve: Good trade by the Yankees overall
[7/19/17, 12:27:31 PM] Steve: Still need a starting pitcher
[7/19/17, 12:27:50 PM] Miller: at least 1
[7/19/17, 12:27:52 PM] Steve: But they gave away talent from a strength (young OF)
[7/19/17, 12:27:57 PM] Steve: So I'm fine with it
[7/19/17, 12:28:03 PM] Miller: and blocked the red sox
[7/19/17, 12:28:07 PM] Miller: BP gonna be nasty now
[7/19/17, 12:28:18 PM] Miller: could use betances in like the 6th in theory
[7/19/17, 12:28:34 PM] Steve: Girardi can play around
[7/19/17, 12:28:44 PM] Steve: But having 4 shutdown guys is a great luxury
[7/19/17, 12:28:52 PM] Miller: id never heard of that other guy they got back but hes having a ridiculous yr
[7/19/17, 12:28:56 PM] Miller: and throws 100mph
[7/19/17, 12:29:01 PM] Steve: Still think they go after gray if the price isn't too high
[7/19/17, 12:29:20 PM] Steve: That would cost them at least a gleyber
[7/19/17, 12:29:40 PM] Miller: i would trade for verlander
[7/19/17, 12:29:43 PM] Miller: and take the salary
[7/19/17, 12:29:48 PM] Miller: would cost very little in prospects is my guess
[7/19/17, 12:29:54 PM] Steve: It would certainly cost less
[7/19/17, 12:30:03 PM] Steve: Or at least not the top prospects
[7/19/17, 12:30:31 PM] Steve: I think if Tanaka can get on track it would be like acquiring another SP
[7/19/17, 12:30:35 PM] Steve: He's been bad all season
[7/19/17, 12:30:51 PM] Miller: any reason to think he turns it around though?
[7/19/17, 12:30:52 PM] Miller: hes been awful
[7/19/17, 12:31:00 PM] Steve: No real reason
[7/19/17, 12:31:12 PM] Steve: Just my hope and his good track record overall
[7/19/17, 12:31:17 PM] Miller: @19732079889 Os gonna trade any of their pitchers?
[7/19/17, 12:31:19 PM] Steve: This season has been bad
[7/19/17, 12:31:25 PM] Miller: have a bunch of mediocre SPs dont they?
[7/19/17, 12:31:27 PM] Steve: Not to the Yankees
[7/19/17, 12:31:30 PM] Miller: true
[7/19/17, 12:31:40 PM] Steve: No one in that division is making a deal
[7/19/17, 12:32:10 PM] Steve: Good thing is at least we get this bullpen for more than one year
[7/19/17, 12:32:20 PM] Steve: All under contract until at least '18
[7/19/17, 12:33:56 PM] Steve: Tanaka last start was good despite the L
[7/19/17, 12:34:07 PM] Justin: Yeh pen is nasty if this young guy is good
[7/19/17, 12:34:10 PM] Steve: He made one mistake to mookie
[7/19/17, 12:34:25 PM] Miller: frazier gonna play 1st or 3rd? or both?
[7/19/17, 12:34:40 PM] Steve: According to reports he will start at 1st
[7/19/17, 12:34:49 PM] Miller: holliday done? or is he DHing?
[7/19/17, 12:34:56 PM] Steve: But girardi will be switching him and headley
[7/19/17, 12:35:08 PM] Steve: He's been the DH all season
[7/19/17, 12:35:14 PM] Steve: Other than a few games at first
[7/19/17, 12:35:20 PM] Miller: gotcha, thought he was playing 1b
[7/19/17, 12:35:29 PM] Steve: He's played it a little
[7/19/17, 12:35:42 PM] Steve: But carter has gotten the majority of starts this year
[7/19/17, 12:35:51 PM] Steve: Among the 7 first basemans we've used
[7/19/17, 12:36:05 PM] Steve: During the white six trade rumors
[7/19/17, 12:36:17 PM] Miller: bird law - never go into the season relying on a guy named bird to be your 1st basement
[7/19/17, 12:36:18 PM] Steve: I was hearing the Yankees were taking Duda/reed from the mets
[7/19/17, 12:36:32 PM] Miller: yea i saw that also, have to imagine those 2 would have been essentially free
[7/19/17, 12:36:32 PM] Steve: *talking
[7/19/17, 12:36:46 PM] Miller: but duda being LH doesnt really help, i think they wanted a RH bat
[7/19/17, 12:37:22 PM] Steve: But cashman has to make one more move
[7/19/17, 12:37:25 PM] Steve: We'll see
[7/19/17, 12:37:30 PM] Steve: So far, so good
[7/19/17, 12:37:36 PM] Miller: mets have no SPs to sell in their upcoming fire sale
[7/19/17, 12:38:01 PM] Steve: Anyone the Yankees would want from the mets would cost them too much
[7/19/17, 12:38:03 PM] Miller: hope they trade grandy to a contender
[7/19/17, 12:38:07 PM] Miller: guys the best
[7/19/17, 1:48:44 PM] Justin: kinda ironic all the "we don't want the govt haivng our information" are likely cheering on trump as he demands voter info from states
[7/19/17, 1:50:02 PM] Launchpad: well yes we've well established that most Trump supporters are quite stupide

[7/19/17, 2:17:40 PM] Miller: listening to him this AM "well if the states dont want to give us that information, people need to be asking what they are hiding"
alternatively if our president doesnt want to release his tax returns, people need to be asking what he is hiding
[7/19/17, 2:20:33 PM] Justin: im sure that will be demcoaraats 2020 platform, commerical of trump saying that and his tax returns
[7/19/17, 2:20:56 PM] Justin: worked great in 2016

[7/19/17, 2:24:52 PM] Miller: yea i could easily see trump being re-elected
[7/19/17, 2:25:18 PM] Miller: hes done about as poorly a job as possible 1st 6mo and still has like 85% favorability w/his base so he has a couple more yrs to actually do something
[7/19/17, 2:25:25 PM] Justin: hoenstly with voter fruad panel, he may never leave
[7/19/17, 2:25:46 PM] Miller: democratic party just getting more and more split
[7/19/17, 2:25:47 PM] Justin: can youi imagine what all that data could do for voter supression
[7/19/17, 2:26:56 PM] Justin: defintiely some direct parallel to england
[7/19/17, 2:29:02 PM] Justin: tbh both aprties cant get shit together though
[7/19/17, 2:29:29 PM] Justin: but republicans are doing alright because all news cares about is russia
[7/19/17, 2:29:54 PM] Justin: which is prety much squarely a party line topic
[7/19/17, 2:30:27 PM] Justin: its insane that democrats would run on things like russia instead of saving SS/ medicaire

[7/19/17, 6:11:19 PM] Justin: or is this all on ky performance
[7/19/17, 6:11:48 PM] Launchpad: I would not do that unless I was trying to get unmatched
[7/19/17, 6:11:59 PM] Launchpad: must be performance related
[7/19/17, 6:12:05 PM] Justin: i mean it happened anyway so.....
[7/19/17, 6:12:06 PM] Launchpad: I didn't get to send any message

[7/19/17, 6:12:45 PM] Justin: true
[7/19/17, 9:35:53 PM] Launchpad: btw I wasn't blocked, just the app glitching - she dissappeared and reappeared

[7/20/17, 9:31:15 AM] Kiyoon: lol you message her Scottie?

[7/20/17, 3:01:22 PM] Miller: why is this OJ shit on every single channel all day today?
[7/20/17, 3:01:27 PM] Miller: could not possibly care less
[7/20/17, 3:02:02 PM] Steve: Because of his trial 20+ years ago

[7/20/17, 3:05:31 PM] Miller: guy in cult "zombies and reptile people are real, you people are all sheep"
cult "youre a reptile"

[7/20/17, 3:19:08 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/20/17, 3:19:29 PM] Miller: the amount of time and energy this woman spends on this, she either is somehow monetizing it or is actually insane
[7/20/17, 3:20:28 PM] Miller: i like how this whistleblower guy (who died) thinks hes like blowing the doors off this by EXPOSING her that shes lying, like yea pretty sure 99.9% of people already thought that
[7/20/17, 3:20:31 PM] Justin: She believes she's descendent of king David
[7/20/17, 3:22:17 PM] Justin: Yeh I got thru 2 minutes. "Usually in avoiding being poisoned or avoiding seal teams from assassinating me ".  Lol yeh seal team 6 would have a real tough time merking some psychotic bitch
[7/20/17, 3:23:01 PM] Miller: its funny this guy thinks he needs 3 videos 50 mins long to tell people shes lying
[7/20/17, 3:23:11 PM] Miller: one 30 second video could have done it
[7/20/17, 3:23:30 PM] Miller: hey this bitch belives she talks to lucifer and all celebrities are reptile people
[7/20/17, 3:32:26 PM] Donk: Before the All-Star break, Judge might‚Äôve been the clear MVP, but in the second half he‚Äôs been the worst player in the league. According to FanGraphs, Judge has been worth minus-0.4 wins, tied with Mitch Moreland for the lowest figure in the majors among players who have appeared in seven games. He‚Äôs hitting for no power. His .115 batting average is also his slugging percentage, and he‚Äôs getting on base about as often as Adam Wainwright. In 31 plate appearances, Judge is 3-for-26 with nine strikeouts and a minus-10 wRC+; he‚Äôs hit into two double plays and been caught stealing once. You‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhether you‚Äôre Garry Kasparov, a Subway sandwich artist, or a disgraced former beekeeper‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähave been a more valuable contributor to the Yankees since July 14.
[7/20/17, 3:35:48 PM] Justin: yeh like if some girl was like my name is buffy, vampires are real and when you stake them thru the heart they turn to dust.....the moment she merks a vampire in front of me and he turns to dust, Im all in.  This bitch is like there is a rock that kills lizard people.   lizards inhabit all of televison actors and the entire dc area.  Where the one guy with any sense that like, ok show me how the rock works, lets go get some lizard peoples?
[7/20/17, 3:36:58 PM] Justin: haha that jennifer hudson thing is awesome
[7/20/17, 3:37:16 PM] Justin: yeh her main enemeies are lizard people, demons, and libtards
[7/20/17, 3:37:14 PM] Miller: another carrer ended by the HRD
[7/20/17, 3:38:10 PM] Justin: also got robed of home run other day
[7/20/17, 3:38:40 PM] Miller: thats just part of the HRD curse
[7/20/17, 3:38:42 PM] Justin: not saying his 1/2 stats are really sustainable
[7/20/17, 3:38:42 PM] Miller: it works in many ways
[7/20/17, 3:39:37 PM] Miller: trump believes the human body has a finite amount of energy to expend, i believe the same is true about HRs, so judge was probably going to hit 80 HRs this yr but then he went and hit 50 at the derby so what can you do
[7/20/17, 3:42:56 PM] Donk: i think hes just coming back down to earth to become what everyone expected him to be Adam Dunn 2.0 - its crazy that in the first half he was pace to strike out 200 times, yet was still hitting 330
[7/20/17, 3:43:23 PM] Dan Watts: Or he's off the üíâüíâüíâ
[7/20/17, 3:44:50 PM] Justin: yeh ill take adam dunn career 850 ops and 37 hr a year
[7/20/17, 3:45:43 PM] Donk: for sure
[7/20/17, 3:45:50 PM] Donk: but he was hitting like barry bonds in the first half
[7/20/17, 3:46:21 PM] Miller: poor adam dunn
[7/20/17, 3:46:23 PM] Miller: was ahead of his time
[7/20/17, 3:46:33 PM] Miller: played in an era where people still cared about strikeouts

[7/20/17, 3:59:22 PM] Dan Watts: damn too bad we didn't meet that chick in austin. she's pretty hot and she clearly likes to have a good time
[7/20/17, 4:06:34 PM] Launchpad: how many teeth she got?

[7/20/17, 5:46:23 PM] Launchpad: Looks like it will blow up if pick a high enough number
[7/20/17, 5:46:43 PM] Launchpad: Try fib(100) or fib (1000)
[7/20/17, 5:49:15 PM] Miller: launchpad said you come at the king you best not miss
[7/20/17, 6:00:32 PM] Launchpad: lol no, its like I can see the CS lesson plan.  First they teach you about recursion and how to do fibonacci, then about the program stack and why that will blow up, and finally an iterative solution thats much more efficient
[7/21/17, 11:50:33 AM] Launchpad: Time to short Snapchat? "All told, 97 percent of Snap will be potentially available on the stock market by the end of August, up from just 13 percent now, according to Anmuth. "
[7/21/17, 12:00:06 PM] Miller: eating an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie really makes me wonder what idiot ever decided to put raisins in these things
[7/21/17, 12:01:16 PM] Justin: Glass half full...what genius decided to put chocolate in it?
[7/21/17, 12:02:00 PM] Miller: true
[7/21/17, 12:02:04 PM] Miller: seems like such an obvious move
[7/21/17, 12:02:18 PM] Miller: amazing i dont think i ever saw one until last yr
[7/21/17, 12:05:22 PM] Miller: spicy out
[7/21/17, 12:15:11 PM] Dan Watts: RIP Spice
[7/21/17, 12:15:36 PM] Dan Watts: Spice def getting a book deal
[7/21/17, 12:17:29 PM] Justin: Lol
[7/21/17, 12:17:46 PM] Justin: Hope snl doesn't resign him

[7/21/17, 5:58:53 PM] Launchpad: I would recommend any 1st born / only children in this thread not go anytime soon
[7/21/17, 6:28:30 PM] Dan Watts: I'm over chipotle anyway
[7/21/17, 6:28:37 PM] Dan Watts: Played out
[7/21/17, 6:29:04 PM] Launchpad: i went today for the first time in a while
[7/21/17, 6:30:11 PM] Miller: Bring back Qdoba
[7/21/17, 6:30:29 PM] Dan Watts: Is this kyrie thing #realnews?
[7/21/17, 6:30:54 PM] Miller: Seems so
[7/21/17, 6:31:37 PM] Launchpad: and Moe's
[7/21/17, 6:35:26 PM] Miller: @Schultz_Report: Source: #Knicks and #Cavs in serious talks centered around Carmelo Anthony and Kyrie Irving+possible 3rd team (maybe #Suns). https://t.co/wb5uB85SUZ
[7/21/17, 6:37:52 PM] Dan Watts: Wow
[7/21/17, 6:41:40 PM] Kiyoon: Didn't they just draft a pg
[7/21/17, 6:42:00 PM] Launchpad: this is the knicks we're talking about
[7/21/17, 6:42:35 PM] Kiyoon: Guess Kyrie can play the 2
[7/21/17, 6:45:24 PM] Miller: This kid they drafted is 18
[7/21/17, 6:46:58 PM] Miller: If you have a chance to get kyrie you certainly don't let that stop you
[7/21/17, 6:49:13 PM] Kiyoon: How old Kyrie
[7/21/17, 6:49:29 PM] Kiyoon: Well I think if you have the chance to dump Melo certainly don't let that stop you
[7/21/17, 6:50:39 PM] Steve: 25
[7/21/17, 7:20:40 PM] Tk: Kyrie for Melo doesnt make much sense foe the Cavs? Dont they have to trade Love. Doesnt seem like theres any reasonable market  Love. Why didnt kyrie express this when  free agency first started?
[7/21/17, 7:44:16 PM] Brian Katz: You got it all wrong, the Knicks are the third team in the deal. Suns get kyrie, cavs get all the the other good stuff, and we give up draft picks for a vet. It's how we roll.
[7/21/17, 7:45:38 PM] Steve: #katzhate

[7/23/17, 7:43:11 PM] Justin: THere were some hilarious moments in friends from college
[7/23/17, 7:43:20 PM] Justin: I think it's worth a binge.
[7/23/17, 7:43:51 PM] Justin: Hands down best sequence in show is reverse gender roll streetcar play
[7/24/17, 10:56:28 AM] Launchpad: Would you describe the main characters as unlikable?
[7/24/17, 1:12:32 PM] Justin: yeh presumably accurate
[7/24/17, 4:01:32 PM] Steve: Any and all republicans
[7/24/17, 4:01:49 PM] Launchpad: my brother üòÇ
[7/24/17, 4:01:52 PM] Steve: Or at least they've been playing that card for 7 1/2 years
[7/24/17, 4:02:18 PM] Steve: I actually think this becomes more of a joke every fucking day
[7/24/17, 4:03:06 PM] Donk: how was your brother an obamacare victim?
[7/24/17, 4:03:25 PM] Launchpad: he had to pay a fine for not signing up for insurance (i think)
[7/24/17, 4:03:33 PM] Donk: oh haha
[7/24/17, 4:03:38 PM] Donk: yeah i dont think that counts
[7/24/17, 4:03:40 PM] Justin: I suppose im an "obamacare victim" as well
[7/24/17, 4:03:40 PM] Launchpad: VICTIM
[7/24/17, 4:03:45 PM] Miller: (well he didnt have to but he didnt know he was exempt)
[7/24/17, 4:03:47 PM] Launchpad: that counts
[7/24/17, 4:04:23 PM] Launchpad: then hes a victim of bureaucracy & paperwork
[7/24/17, 4:04:41 PM] Donk: it counts the same as when you get a fined/ticket for not having car insuranse
[7/24/17, 4:04:50 PM] Justin: he didnt actually ahve to pay said fine id presume
[7/24/17, 4:05:10 PM] Launchpad: not sure
[7/24/17, 4:05:13 PM] Justin: because noone has to pay said fine, there is only one enforcement mechanism
[7/24/17, 4:05:32 PM] Launchpad: except in that case you are driving a car -- in his case he's penalized for being alive
[7/24/17, 4:05:47 PM] Miller: except he wasnt
[7/24/17, 4:06:02 PM] Miller: he chose to pay a fine he was not required to b/c he didnt know any better
[7/24/17, 4:06:33 PM] Justin: were still operating under assumption he may have had to pay
[7/24/17, 4:06:45 PM] Justin: well he didnt have to pay...he may have actually paid
[7/24/17, 4:08:17 PM] Justin: rewinding back do you have to pay registration? car insurance?
[7/24/17, 4:09:39 PM] Launchpad: Look man, Im just pointing out that victims exist - we don't need to argue over metaphors.  Stop blaming and shaming the victim, its disgusting
[7/24/17, 4:09:48 PM] Launchpad: hes meeting with Trump as we speak
[7/24/17, 4:10:06 PM] Justin: lol, like i said im techinically a victim--- its pretty snowflaky to consider me a victim
[7/24/17, 4:10:47 PM] Justin: hence the whole point of the insanity of that term....id assume hes gonna bring in all kinds of small business owners that cant affor dto pay insurance for their employees
[7/24/17, 4:12:09 PM] Justin: to which the answer is, if your business model with 30 employees requires you using governments medicaide to your advantage to attain said employees, you can't start whining about market solutions and undair regulatory burden
[7/24/17, 4:14:19 PM] Launchpad: at the same time, you ought to ask yourself....why must an employer be responsible for paying personal insurance costs?? This model began as an employment perk -- offered due to group discount pricing
[7/24/17, 4:14:41 PM] Justin: why should my tax dolalrs go to subsidize that employers cost?
[7/24/17, 4:14:57 PM] Justin: employment eperk = total cost
[7/24/17, 4:15:05 PM] Launchpad: you voted on high taxes
[7/24/17, 4:15:08 PM] Justin: if govt is paying for that perk- im apying part of cost of that employee
[7/24/17, 4:15:26 PM] Justin: but thats not the point
[7/24/17, 4:15:29 PM] Launchpad: the govt is paying for my health insurance
[7/24/17, 4:15:39 PM] Justin: you cant with one hand say govt regulation is bad and than use it as fundamental to your bsiness model
[7/24/17, 4:15:54 PM] Launchpad: if my business is flipping burgers -- I only need minimum wage earning high school students to operate...why the fuck should I be paying for their health insurance
[7/24/17, 4:16:00 PM] Justin: clearly its good when it pays the cost of your employees
[7/24/17, 4:16:26 PM] Launchpad: here you go again making blanket assumptions that I'm an evil libertarian with one mode -- remove regulations
[7/24/17, 4:16:30 PM] Justin: because if those employees didnt have health coverage it would detreimentally effect your workforce
[7/24/17, 4:16:41 PM] Justin: im note ven talking about you
[7/24/17, 4:16:54 PM] Justin: im tlaking about someone arguing about how they shoudlnt be mandated to rpovide helath insurance
[7/24/17, 4:17:00 PM] Justin: becuase its unfiar regulatory burden
[7/24/17, 4:17:23 PM] Justin: well in those cases perhaps the governemtn should jsut charge them for medicaide reimbursements?
[7/24/17, 4:17:29 PM] Launchpad: its always unfair to someone
[7/24/17, 4:20:53 PM] Justin: I mean its batshit crazy to think the macro effects of eliminating food stamps and medicaide along side a min wage, would somehow lead to a utopia
[7/24/17, 4:21:17 PM] Justin: you literlaly just said someone flipping burgers has no choice
[7/24/17, 4:21:17 PM] Launchpad: i never advocated eliminating food stamps or medicaide
[7/24/17, 4:21:27 PM] Justin: i once again am not saying you did
[7/24/17, 4:21:43 PM] Justin: im talking about macro effects of eliminating regulatory burdens
[7/24/17, 4:22:03 PM] Justin: so someone flipping burgers has no chocie and they are beign given food housing and health car eform govt
[7/24/17, 4:22:19 PM] Justin: if we eliminated min wage and all those beneifts, how would that create choice for those workers?
[7/24/17, 4:22:26 PM] Justin: what would be the liekly result
[7/24/17, 4:24:05 PM] Launchpad: I remember when I was growing up.  Flipping burgers was a rite of passage.  It was a part time job to earn money for HS or college.  It was a look into your future that you did not want to have.  Being a life long burger flipper was synonymous with being a loser.
[7/24/17, 4:24:36 PM] Launchpad: No one ever said "When I grow up, I want to be a junkie or flip burgers"
[7/24/17, 4:24:49 PM] Justin: "The U.S. Census Bureau reported in September 2014 that: U.S. real (inflation adjusted) median household income was $51,939 in 2013 versus $51,758 in 2012, statistically unchanged."
[7/24/17, 4:25:05 PM] Justin: wells omehow 50% of the nation with both parents working is living on near min wage wages
[7/24/17, 4:25:14 PM] Justin: so maybe something went wrong somewhere
[7/24/17, 4:26:22 PM] Launchpad: the problem is, its a trivial menial task -- why should an employer be responsible for ensuring that each employee has a livable wage?? Your life is your responsibility, not your employer
[7/24/17, 4:26:29 PM] Launchpad: and they don't live in NY and they don't pay overinflated NY pricew
[7/24/17, 4:26:51 PM] Justin: yeh im sure 50k a year gets you far with a family of 4 in alabama
[7/24/17, 4:27:04 PM] Justin: its not the medicaide and the food stamps
[7/24/17, 4:27:11 PM] Justin: which allow them to not die
[7/24/17, 4:27:14 PM] Launchpad: lot easier to survive on $50k when you're not paying $2200 a month for a 1BR apartment
[7/24/17, 4:27:44 PM] Launchpad: do you believe in personal responsibility?
[7/24/17, 4:28:44 PM] Justin: no
[7/24/17, 4:29:04 PM] Launchpad: You know the rules of the game. You can play by them and thrive, or you can cry and complain how life isn't fair and be a victim
[7/24/17, 4:29:16 PM] Launchpad: you are an enabler of victim mentality
[7/24/17, 4:29:27 PM] Justin: ok so lets rewind, what is btiching about obamacare tax exactly?
[7/24/17, 4:29:38 PM] Justin: is that not the rules of the game?
[7/24/17, 4:29:52 PM] Justin: or are there some set of other rules that you are referring to?>
[7/24/17, 4:29:54 PM] Launchpad: honestly I was making like of the picture you posted
[7/24/17, 4:30:00 PM] Launchpad: **light
[7/24/17, 4:30:10 PM] Launchpad: my brother fucked up, so he has to pay the price
[7/24/17, 4:30:23 PM] Launchpad: Im not going to protest over it
[7/24/17, 4:30:30 PM] Launchpad: protesting has a very low ROI
[7/24/17, 4:30:52 PM] Justin: in fairness as does active day trading versus passive investment
[7/24/17, 4:31:52 PM] Justin: which is just to point out that, as you say everything isnt black and hwite, so why measure something like protesting in terms of ROI
[7/24/17, 4:32:46 PM] Justin: i means its results are mostly intangible even if the result ever comes to fruition
[7/24/17, 4:33:45 PM] Launchpad: Most people want to change the world but aren't willing to change themselves
[7/24/17, 4:34:20 PM] Justin: most people think tehy will be welathy but will die poor
[7/24/17, 4:34:24 PM] Justin: axioms are fun
[7/24/17, 4:34:56 PM] Launchpad: I don't think the first part is true at all
[7/24/17, 4:35:04 PM] Justin: well math does
[7/24/17, 4:35:09 PM] Brian Katz: Some people wish that they were taller
[7/24/17, 4:35:10 PM] Justin: math alot more behind that than yours
[7/24/17, 4:35:15 PM] Justin: or ballers
[7/24/17, 4:35:24 PM] Justin: shot callers
[7/24/17, 4:35:57 PM] Brian Katz: Herman gets it
[7/24/17, 4:37:10 PM] Launchpad: We carry around the aggregate sum of all human knowledge in our pockets, but most people don't care about that, they just want to look at memes and complain
[7/24/17, 4:37:38 PM] Launchpad: I wish I had a üê∞ in a üé©
[7/24/17, 4:37:48 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/24/17, 4:39:20 PM] Justin: 37% of americans think tehy will become rich one day.....defined as around 500k if we aggregate---- so about 2% make that-----so of that 37% at least 35% of them are wrong....for a whopping 94.5% being wrong
[7/24/17, 4:40:04 PM] Justin: thats impressively wrong---my axiom seems pretty accurate.... ill await the math on people thinkign they can change world but not themselves
[7/24/17, 4:40:18 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/24/17, 4:40:30 PM] Launchpad: what percent of those 37% end up on food stamps vs living a comfortable middle class life?
[7/24/17, 4:40:43 PM] Justin: thats fiar i did say die poor
[7/24/17, 4:41:04 PM] Donk: wouldnt it make more sense for a white person to write about what makes white people uncomfortable
[7/24/17, 4:41:33 PM] Justin: i cnat come to an absolute bottom there as 37% is more than the 25% or so of americans that will die poor
[7/24/17, 4:41:38 PM] Miller: dont worry, he can do w/e he wants as long as he can still play football at an elite level üòá
[7/24/17, 4:42:01 PM] Launchpad: all that matters!
[7/24/17, 4:42:15 PM] Miller: im sure this book will be one of the reasons hes "blackballed" in a few yrs
[7/24/17, 4:42:49 PM] Launchpad: Poor - if you include possessing the aggregate sum of all human knowledge in their pocket
[7/24/17, 4:45:04 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty gets it too
[7/24/17, 4:47:55 PM] Launchpad: At the end of the day, there's a ton of people in this world who don't give a fuck and don't want to help themselves.  They don't care about "reading" - they just want to get high.  They have no ambition, no motivation  --- at what point do we just say fuck em?
[7/24/17, 4:48:38 PM] Miller: dude your brother is gonna read this and be upset
[7/24/17, 4:49:22 PM] Justin: at the end of the day there is a ton of people in this world that wnat to help themselves but are trapped in shitty jobs with limited oppurtunity.  they care about reading but dont have the time, they may resort to drugs becuase like feels like it abandoned them.  There amboition has been crushed by the realities surrounding them, at what point did they go wrong?
[7/24/17, 4:50:00 PM] Justin: spinning fairy tales are fun without facts
[7/24/17, 4:50:05 PM] Justin: just words on a screen
[7/24/17, 4:52:06 PM] Launchpad: so don't need more money and perks, they need mentors
[7/24/17, 4:52:53 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/24/17, 4:53:03 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/24/17, 4:53:12 PM] Justin: if you want an ideology grounded in fact, people are poor for all kinds of reasons.  Laziness and lack of ambition likely doesn't make up a large percentage of those cases.  "Almost 63 percent of America's work-eligible poor are working, and 73 percent of public support recipients are members of working families. As noted by Paul Krugman, "only 26 percent of jobless Americans are receiving any kind of unemployment benefit, the lowest level in many decades." "
[7/24/17, 4:53:19 PM] Launchpad: its not a good argument unless there's 3rd party trolling
[7/24/17, 4:53:40 PM] Justin: yeh argument going nowhere never does though so lets talk about shot callers
[7/24/17, 4:55:19 PM] Launchpad: You have no choice in the matter to be born poor.  To remain poor is your choice
[7/24/17, 5:06:50 PM] Launchpad: Hypothetical example: if Donald Trump made it a requirement that all new SNAP patrons must take a free single 8 hour introductory personally finance seminar, which included topics like - signing up for a bank account, contributing to a 401k/IRA, budgeting, saving money through automatic withdrawals, etc. (no stock market) --- would you be for it or against it?
[7/24/17, 5:07:57 PM] Dan Watts: For it, only if trump university teaches said courses
[7/24/17, 5:08:08 PM] Launchpad: lol
[7/24/17, 5:08:13 PM] Launchpad: no trump university
[7/24/17, 5:09:26 PM] Justin: would think we could jsut teach that in school if it takes 8 hours
[7/24/17, 5:09:29 PM] Miller: and charges them 2x w/e they get from SNAP
[7/24/17, 5:09:50 PM] Launchpad: it absolutely shoujld be taught in schools
[7/24/17, 5:11:15 PM] Launchpad: and for someone who is in love with data, take a look at the 'average' millionaire:
https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474
[7/24/17, 5:11:18 PM] Donk: given the amount of complaiing about the cost of entitlement programs, lets make the more expensive by mandating more programs?
[7/24/17, 5:11:25 PM] Launchpad: more likely to drive a ford than a BMW
[7/24/17, 5:12:02 PM] Miller: more likely to be worth 1m than not
[7/24/17, 5:12:13 PM] Launchpad: lol that too
[7/24/17, 9:24:38 PM] Miller: http://www.dailywire.com/news/18941/true-socialist-apparently-bernie-sanders-stealing-amanda-prestigiacomo?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_content=072417-news&utm_campaign=benshapiro
[7/24/17, 9:24:43 PM] Miller: That's just hilarious
[7/24/17, 9:31:30 PM] Launchpad: "Its everyone's Post Bro"
[7/24/17, 9:56:35 PM] Dan Watts: "Sticky fingered socialist Bernie Sanders" sounds like the beginning of a trump tweet
[7/24/17, 10:31:47 PM] Justin: Most disappointing part about that tale is that it would mean Bernie is reading that trash.
[7/25/17, 5:59:46 AM] Miller: Cowboys waived WR Lucky Whitehead.

Charged with petty larceny in Virginia last month, Whitehead then missed a court date. His agent denies Whitehead was even in Virginia when the incident allegedly took place, but the Cowboys are taking a stand. (For once.) Though we're not sure this one is truly deserved considering all the shenanigans the Dallas organization has allowed over the years. Whitehead is a bottom-roster player.
[7/25/17, 6:00:10 AM] Miller: Weird the Cowboys haven't treated dez or zeke like this ü§î
[7/25/17, 9:50:45 AM] Miller: https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/25/16025066/lyft-taco-bell-mode-late-night 
the future is here
[7/25/17, 9:51:21 AM] Launchpad: pretty genius right there
[7/25/17, 9:51:25 AM] Brian Katz: I'm over Taco Bell. Had last Saturday and it's basically garbage.
[7/25/17, 9:52:26 AM] Launchpad: It may be gargage, but you can get over 250 permutations of garbage for just $8
[7/25/17, 10:18:07 AM] Brian Katz: You're right, it's gargage lol
[7/25/17, 11:25:38 AM] Launchpad: whats the total these days katz??
[7/25/17, 11:25:54 AM] Launchpad: you skinnier than cheese yet?
[7/25/17, 11:39:58 AM] Brian Katz: I hit 241 down 84lbs.
[7/25/17, 11:40:30 AM] Launchpad: fucken solid
[7/25/17, 11:40:34 AM] Launchpad: officially 1 pound less than my heaviest
[7/25/17, 11:41:00 AM] Launchpad: Ive been getting back into the gym / diet these last 2-3 weeks
[7/25/17, 11:46:23 AM] Brian Katz: Nice, what have you been doing at the gym?
[7/25/17, 11:46:26 AM] Miller: All charges stemming from ex-Cowboys WR/KR Lucky Whitehead's petty larceny case have been dropped.
[7/25/17, 11:46:52 AM] Brian Katz: Oh thank goodness lol
[7/25/17, 11:48:27 AM] Launchpad: mostly machine splits - chest, back, shoulders, legs
[7/25/17, 11:48:31 AM] Launchpad: plus running 2 miles a day
[7/25/17, 11:48:35 AM] Justin: Dickpushups
[7/25/17, 12:02:16 PM] Donk: cowboys do as the cowboys do
[7/25/17, 12:03:48 PM] Miller: i just cant help but wonder if whitehead would be a FA today if he was more talented
[7/25/17, 12:03:54 PM] Miller: its quite perplexing
[7/25/17, 12:05:07 PM] Brian Katz: I've starting running too. I'm doing 3.25 miles three times a week at the track.
[7/25/17, 12:28:18 PM] Miller: A Boston University study found CTE In 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players
[7/25/17, 12:28:20 PM] Miller: damn
[7/25/17, 12:46:39 PM] Launchpad: Rich also added that Whitehead's warrant was dropped as the "police had the wrong guy." The Cowboys, who released the wideout Monday after learning of his June incident, didn't submit the paperwork for his transaction on time. Therefore, he remains a member of the team, for now, per Rapoport. There will be greater clarity on Whitehead's status on the Cowboys at the close of business Tuesday.

[7/25/17, 1:12:32 PM] Justin: .....I also heard Washington cutting rob kelly for peeing on bernies stolen washington post
[7/25/17, 1:16:21 PM] Miller: yankees should just go yolo and get both darvish and verlander and make a real run at it
[7/25/17, 1:34:23 PM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/25/17, 2:06:36 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/25/17, 2:06:58 PM] Donk: https://www.jambase.com/article/nyc-rapper-provides-phish-tribute-ahead-bakers-dozen
[7/25/17, 2:07:13 PM] Donk: surprisingly great rap that samples phish songs
[7/25/17, 2:07:29 PM] Donk: tho0ugh maybe you need to know the phish lyrics to get alot of it
[7/25/17, 2:39:45 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/25/17, 3:28:30 PM] Justin: I'm no longer a victim
[7/25/17, 3:28:40 PM] Justin: Doesn't feel any different
[7/25/17, 3:28:47 PM] Miller: youre still a victim
[7/25/17, 3:28:50 PM] Miller: they didnt do anything
[7/25/17, 3:28:52 PM] Justin: Lol
[7/25/17, 3:28:57 PM] Miller: and they arent going to
[7/25/17, 3:29:17 PM] Justin: What was he vote
[7/25/17, 3:29:27 PM] Miller: it was just a motion to proceed
[7/25/17, 3:29:34 PM] Miller: a vote on whether to debate and then vote
[7/25/17, 3:29:35 PM] Justin: Got ya
[7/25/17, 3:29:45 PM] Justin: Now they present plans
[7/25/17, 3:29:58 PM] Miller: and they already lost collins/murkowski on that vote and then paul is a NO on anything other than full repeal (which doesnt have 50 votes) so its still DOA
[7/25/17, 3:30:22 PM] Donk: yeah but now trump can claim victory on social media
[7/25/17, 3:30:42 PM] Miller: just got this in my email
[7/25/17, 3:30:42 PM] Miller: After seven years, a "win" is deciding to talk on the Senate Floor about repeal and replace.
In the absence of a solution, what are we talking about? This is not unlike drawing waves around a still picture to create the illusion of motion.
Regardless of procedural vote, we do not see 50 GOP Senate votes on anything of health care substance.
But more time to burn at expense of upcoming gov't shutdown
[7/25/17, 3:31:43 PM] Justin: Yeh I get it.
[7/25/17, 3:31:55 PM] Justin: So McCain rushed to congress w cancer for that
[7/25/17, 3:31:56 PM] Justin: Lol
[7/25/17, 3:32:02 PM] Miller: yes
[7/25/17, 3:32:06 PM] Justin: Idiot
[7/25/17, 3:32:12 PM] Miller: i was really hoping he was coming back just to vote no on the motion
[7/25/17, 3:32:14 PM] Justin: Seems worth it
[7/25/17, 3:32:15 PM] Miller: i would have died laughing
[7/25/17, 3:32:32 PM] Miller: he also made a whole dramatic thing about it
[7/25/17, 3:32:59 PM] Miller: and then also subsequently said he isnt voting for the HC bill and said the entire process has been a disaster
[7/25/17, 3:33:46 PM] Miller: some protestors going HAM rn
[7/25/17, 3:33:50 PM] Miller: where you at @16316620763
[7/25/17, 3:34:03 PM] Miller: oh shit theyre calling in the sargeant of arms
[7/25/17, 3:37:15 PM] Dan Watts: Trump is on twitter rampage
[7/25/17, 3:38:35 PM] Justin: Yeh I'm not all in on this Russia nonsense, find it hypocritical, but if his presumed new attorney general, fires special prosecutor, people should riot in streets
[7/25/17, 3:39:32 PM] Miller: yea i dont see how thats kosher
[7/25/17, 3:42:38 PM] Dan Watts: Heard Cruz might be next AG. Didn't think it would be possible to get worse than Jeff Sesh..:
[7/25/17, 3:49:03 PM] Miller: Victor?
[7/25/17, 3:49:08 PM] Miller: gregg rosenthal did list him as a "surprise" cut yest
[7/25/17, 5:43:38 PM] Miller: The Cowboys have no plans to re-sign free agent WR/KR Lucky Whitehead even though his petty larceny arrest was the result of mistaken identity.
"We made a decision," executive vice president Stephen Jones said. "We're moving on.
[7/25/17, 5:43:52 PM] Miller: no #justice4whitehead
[7/25/17, 5:52:37 PM] Brian Katz: Miller must be super bored to be following this story so intently.
[7/25/17, 6:05:37 PM] Brian Katz: I'll take high steve
[7/25/17, 6:06:45 PM] Launchpad: Herman
[7/25/17, 6:07:27 PM] Brian Katz: Only if he's on a diet.
[7/25/17, 6:07:41 PM] Justin: I'm like the trump of food comp.
[7/25/17, 6:07:53 PM] Justin: Still haven't done any, everyone thinks I own that shit
[7/25/17, 6:08:39 PM] Justin: Ironic that when I cut McDonald's out of the McDonald's diet my weight loss stalled?
[7/25/17, 6:08:54 PM] Justin: Just some fast food for thought
[7/25/17, 6:09:58 PM] Brian Katz: You've been around 240 for 5 months homeslice
[7/25/17, 6:10:58 PM] Justin: Well 244 3 months ago. But that's when I cut McDonald's out
[7/25/17, 6:11:58 PM] Justin: So like I said.
[7/25/17, 6:12:26 PM] Brian Katz: So what is your diet now? And have you followed it strictly?
[7/25/17, 6:12:30 PM] Justin: 6 pounds in 8-12 weeks post McDonald's .....26 pounds in 13 weeks with McDonald's
[7/25/17, 6:12:53 PM] Justin: Pretty sure McDonald's was the key
[7/25/17, 6:13:08 PM] Justin: I gotta tweet them and get a McDonald's trainer
[7/25/17, 6:14:19 PM] Justin: I have had trips to Europe Connecticut Vegas/San Diego in those past 12 weeks but I'm going with McDonald's being the key
[7/25/17, 6:16:27 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah......sounds like you've haven't done much, and gotten the same results. I wouldn't congratulate Mac D's so fast lol
[7/25/17, 6:20:02 PM] Justin: I mean the thing that differs is McDonald's...just saying
[7/25/17, 7:45:12 PM] Kiyoon: Me and Steve take that shit down
[7/25/17, 7:45:31 PM] Kiyoon: I can house all the nugs, Steve has the fries
[7/25/17, 7:45:56 PM] Brian Katz: What's your nugget tally kiyoon?
[7/25/17, 7:50:24 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/25/17, 7:50:39 PM] Brian Katz: A that even possible?
[7/25/17, 7:51:24 PM] Miller: If the third out is from like a run down I guess
[7/25/17, 7:51:32 PM] Steve: If the run scored before the third out, yes
[7/25/17, 7:51:48 PM] Steve: Like the third out was caught in a rundown of some sort
[7/25/17, 7:53:23 PM] Kiyoon: I've eaten 40 with no issue drunk, I dno what max I could do
[7/25/17, 7:54:01 PM] Miller: There's 71 in that picture
[7/25/17, 7:59:09 PM] Justin: as im home now, do you think the fact that noone is calling for justice for whitehead strengthens or weakens your Kap stance?
[7/25/17, 8:00:03 PM] Miller: Do you think the fact Whitehead was cut has more to do with his ability as an nfl player or his transgression
[7/25/17, 8:04:39 PM] Justin: well there was no trasngression, so his ability.......hence why noone is arguing for him
[7/25/17, 8:05:33 PM] Miller: So it was a total coincidence then, the timing
[7/25/17, 8:06:59 PM] Justin: consdiering the cut wasnt official, coincidence or not, would there be any literally any backlash if they decided to not cut him?
[7/25/17, 8:07:21 PM] Miller: Why did they cut him? In your opinion
[7/25/17, 8:09:08 PM] Justin: because he was on a roster bubble in the first place likely and lets say they cut him becuase  the false accusations
[7/25/17, 8:09:22 PM] Justin: so why isnt there a backlash?
[7/25/17, 8:09:40 PM] Justin: other than a hashtag in a random whats app group?
[7/25/17, 8:10:17 PM] Justin: black guy falsey accused of doign something gets cut, noone cares
[7/25/17, 8:11:02 PM] Justin: noone is crying racism even though the arrest is obviously motivated by racial bias
[7/25/17, 8:12:01 PM] Launchpad: Is this a fact backed by evidence?
[7/25/17, 8:12:22 PM] Justin: they mistook him for another back person
[7/25/17, 8:12:26 PM] Justin: black *
[7/25/17, 8:12:34 PM] Justin: happens frequently with white people im sure
[7/25/17, 8:14:09 PM] Justin: i know im always worried about being pulled over because the police are looking for a 6:1 white person with ginger hair
[7/25/17, 8:14:46 PM] Miller: Is it this guy's fault he got wrongfully arrested? Of course not
[7/25/17, 8:15:07 PM] Miller: Is it tebows fault he gets a lot of media and fan attention?
[7/25/17, 8:15:10 PM] Miller: Teams don't care
[7/25/17, 8:15:18 PM] Justin: and from a pr perspective the team has nothing to lose by keeping him, probably had something to gain
[7/25/17, 8:15:26 PM] Miller: No team is dealing with a fringe roster spot being in the news
[7/25/17, 8:15:31 PM] Miller: They don't want it
[7/25/17, 8:15:43 PM] Miller: Not worth it
[7/25/17, 8:16:56 PM] Miller: So yea there's tons of examples of teams treating players who have off field issues differently depending how good they are at football, this one is just especially amusing considering its the Cowboys and the guy ended up not even having done anything
[7/25/17, 8:44:01 PM] Launchpad: first his dog gets kidnapped, now this
[7/25/17, 8:44:07 PM] Launchpad: tough week for Lucky
[7/25/17, 8:46:47 PM] Miller: You know what they say, lucky in name, unlucky in life
[7/25/17, 9:12:37 PM] Brian Katz: I feel had he been guilty the cowboys being the cowboys would've stood by him. It's the fact that he didn't do it, that led to the team making this decision.
[7/25/17, 9:18:04 PM] Justin: I 2nd that
[7/25/17, 9:38:03 PM] Justin: thoguth tebow was getting promoted
[7/25/17, 9:40:03 PM] Dan Watts: @15166335046 üéâüôåüï∫üèªüòÇüòé
[7/25/17, 9:41:16 PM] Scott: Yessss
[7/26/17, 5:57:43 AM] Miller: They had cited a man on June 22 with petit larceny outside a convenience store. The man, according to authorities, provided the name Rodney Darnell Whitehead, Jr. - Lucky's full name - but did not possess identification. Police claim he also provided a date of birth and social security number to match the name through the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.
[7/26/17, 5:58:29 AM] Miller: Sounds like clear racism on the cops part, what do they think all black guys with the same names, dob and ssn are the same?
[7/26/17, 9:40:12 AM] Steve: Trump just banned transgender people from serving in the military
[7/26/17, 9:40:12 AM] Steve: But keep caring about whitehead
[7/26/17, 9:42:32 AM] Miller: kids are being bombed by drones every day
[7/26/17, 9:42:38 AM] Miller: but keep caring about trumps tweets
[7/26/17, 9:54:50 AM] Brian Katz: I didn't even know there was transgendered people in the military. How do they feed themselves?
[7/26/17, 11:18:13 AM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/26/17, 11:27:58 AM] Launchpad: lol
[7/26/17, 11:29:36 AM] Launchpad: I could see a reason for not allowing transitioning during active duty, but a blanket ban is quite dumb
[7/26/17, 11:40:08 AM] Dan Watts: I'm going to go fake tranny if there's a draft
[7/26/17, 12:32:48 PM] Launchpad: http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/drinking-a-sugary-drink-with-a-meal-could-be-even-worse-than-you-thought/
[7/26/17, 12:34:35 PM] Launchpad: I thought the only thing that mattered for losing weight was the total number of calories consumed ü§î
[7/26/17, 12:34:52 PM] Launchpad: and now science is tell me that there's more to it??
[7/26/17, 12:44:20 PM] Brian Katz: You're wrong Scotty, only thing that matters in weight loss is intake of mac D's
[7/26/17, 1:19:09 PM] Justin: ok so lets wait a second and read the article
[7/26/17, 1:19:18 PM] Justin: 30% protein intake is a high protein meal?
[7/26/17, 1:19:36 PM] Justin: funny, iw oudlnt clal that a high protein meal
[7/26/17, 1:19:48 PM] Justin: in fact its just baout the bottom of what i strive for in my meals
[7/26/17, 1:20:01 PM] Justin: if im cheating ill be like, ok its 1:1 carb to protein so whatever
[7/26/17, 1:20:39 PM] Justin: so we're already a little iffy....next where the fuck is the control group to ask about the satiation?
[7/26/17, 1:23:14 PM] Justin: now i don't know how this effects their findings, but i know their assumptions to start are pretty weak
[7/26/17, 1:25:10 PM] Justin: im gonna read the actual study......parts like this seem confusing "While having a sugar-sweetened drink increased the amount of energy used to metabolise the meal, the increased expenditure did not even out the consumption of additional calories from the drink."
[7/26/17, 1:30:50 PM] Justin: https://www.muscleforlife.com/low-carb-diet/
[7/26/17, 1:31:37 PM] Justin: When you reduce your carbohydrate intake, you reduce the amount of glycogen stored in the muscles. This, in turn, compromises your performance in the gym‚Äìyou can expect a dramatic reduction in both muscle endurance and strength, which then limits the amount of progressive overload you can subject your muscles to in those workouts. (And less progressive overload in workouts = less muscle growth over time.)
[7/26/17, 1:32:04 PM] Justin: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091182
[7/26/17, 1:36:53 PM] Brian Katz: Wow didn't think sugary drinks and their effect on your metabolism were your hit button issue Herm lol
[7/26/17, 1:40:24 PM] Justin: lol
[7/26/17, 1:49:44 PM] Justin: @16195657200 I mean scientifically speaking, if carbs do in fact lower the bodies ability to  metabolise food, how would that mean a cheat day, where you massively overconsume carbs and calories to the point of days worth of eating,  promotes weight loss?
[7/26/17, 1:52:33 PM] Justin: I mean that would imply that on the day where you are eating likely 25% of your caloric intake for the week, you are at the same time crippling your ability to metabolize that caloric intake......
[7/26/17, 1:54:23 PM] Justin: considering katz has lost 90 pounds doing just that, I'm gonna say theres something else going on
[7/26/17, 2:23:50 PM] Launchpad: Why would you strive to eat a high protein diet? Protein doesn't build muscle, just like sugar doesn't make you fat.  A calorie is a calorie is a calorie, its all energy
[7/26/17, 2:24:44 PM] Launchpad: https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/can-you-build-muscle-on-a-ketogenic-diet.html
[7/26/17, 2:27:58 PM] Justin: did you actaulyl read that whole article?
[7/26/17, 2:28:11 PM] Brian Katz: You saying I'm juicing Herm? Lol
[7/26/17, 2:29:02 PM] Justin: pretty much the thesis says carbs are integral to muscle growth and recovery.... but he set out to acheive a goal with very hard training and acheived that goal, so presumably his body had to adapt and become more efficent
[7/26/17, 2:29:36 PM] Justin: anotherwords he is fully speculating that the keto diet allowed for that muscle growth and he isnt advocating it long term
[7/26/17, 2:29:51 PM] Justin: "Carbs are not required to flip the protein synthesis switch, but perhaps there are other ways to make the overall anabolic process more efficient and effective.

In a chronically low-carb environment, the body doesn't follow the normal biochemical rules because it has to change. It becomes much more efficient with muscle glycogen, it up-regulates gene expression of certain enzymatic machinery needed for maximum performance, and it adapts as needed to excel in the presence of far fewer carbohydrates and much less insulin.

Quite simply, my adventure in carbohydrate-less anabolism was to prove that you can perform at a high level on minimal carbohydrate‚Äîat least in the short term. Carbohydrates are not required to flip the protein synthesis switch, but perhaps there are other ways to make the overall anabolic process more efficient and effective.

Does that mean everyone should adopt a ketogenic diet? I don't think it is for everyone (and perhaps not for the long-term), but it's still interesting to see what your body can achieve through thick and thin."
[7/26/17, 2:29:58 PM] Launchpad: Herman is say that since you lost about 85 pounds in 207 days, 1 pound per 2.435 days, you must be consuming less / burning off 1437 extra calories a day....impressive
[7/26/17, 2:30:41 PM] Justin: kats is on about a 1700 clorie a day diet
[7/26/17, 2:30:53 PM] Justin: at 330 pounds what do tyo think his caloric intake was originally?
[7/26/17, 2:31:03 PM] Justin: id put the over on 3k, but hey thats just me
[7/26/17, 2:31:10 PM] Justin: thanks for doing my math for me though
[7/26/17, 2:31:40 PM] Launchpad: 1700 calories a day....wonder if he could do that all in cheetos?
[7/26/17, 2:32:02 PM] Justin: well according to your guys logic he could becuase the "body would adapt"
[7/26/17, 2:32:20 PM] Justin: what exactly is differnet about the body adapting to low carb diet than a full carb diet?
[7/26/17, 2:32:43 PM] Justin: body composition is a completely different story
[7/26/17, 2:32:57 PM] Launchpad: look man, sugar makes you fat.  When you eat sugar, you don't become as satiated as when you eat quality foods. You crave more sugar
[7/26/17, 2:33:20 PM] Launchpad: if your a bodybuilder and you workout every day, an extra slice of cake wont kill you
[7/26/17, 2:33:21 PM] Justin: ok and craving more sugar means you eat more caloires
[7/26/17, 2:33:26 PM] Justin: no disagremenet with your statement
[7/26/17, 2:33:55 PM] Launchpad: but if the average person makes no other changes to their diet except to cut out sugar, they will lose weight
[7/26/17, 2:34:00 PM] Justin: but thats actualyl different case
[7/26/17, 2:34:06 PM] Justin: if your a bodybuilder you liekly need carbs
[7/26/17, 2:34:14 PM] Launchpad: a big part of Tim Ferris theory
[7/26/17, 2:34:37 PM] Justin: and i feel like we have went over this before, I agree witht that
[7/26/17, 2:35:08 PM] Launchpad: look Id rather follow bad science and magically get good results then follow good science and stay fat.  What do you think @16318489683
[7/26/17, 2:35:15 PM] Launchpad: so why do you eat protein?
[7/26/17, 2:35:21 PM] Justin: guy at gym just lost 30 pounds in about 6 weeks on near no carb diet
[7/26/17, 2:35:29 PM] Launchpad: why is protein some special muscle building nutrient?
[7/26/17, 2:35:44 PM] Justin: his knees started hruting him, he postulated it was liekly form low carb environment
[7/26/17, 2:35:54 PM] Justin: but hes fine with that, it got the job done
[7/26/17, 2:36:01 PM] Launchpad: ohhhhhh.....postulations are good now?
[7/26/17, 2:36:15 PM] Launchpad: funny how my postulations are always junk
[7/26/17, 2:36:27 PM] Justin: well i mean hes sports trainer and had his diet made by nutrtionists working with him and nfl palyers
[7/26/17, 2:36:41 PM] Justin: so there phd's ppstulate that....yes
[7/26/17, 2:37:22 PM] Justin: he explained the reasoning to me, i didnt fulyl udnerstand it
[7/26/17, 2:37:28 PM] Justin: so i sumarized it as postulate
[7/26/17, 2:37:57 PM] Justin: something to do with joints being dried out from the caloric deficit and lack of carbs
[7/26/17, 2:38:15 PM] Justin: perhaps thats mostly from the caloric deficit though adn not the fault of carbs, im sure he has a decent understanding of th process
[7/26/17, 2:38:17 PM] Launchpad: sorry none of the phd's tim ferris has interviewed count for anything, so some random guy with nfl trainers postulating doesn't count either
[7/26/17, 2:38:39 PM] Justin: i mean the article you sent me said long term he doesnt advocate keto
[7/26/17, 2:38:42 PM] Justin: for sports training
[7/26/17, 2:38:46 PM] Justin: he said his body adapted and it worked
[7/26/17, 2:39:04 PM] Launchpad: And more than likely Tim Ferris would have an over the counter supplement to mitigate those affects
[7/26/17, 2:39:28 PM] Justin: lol funny becuase i think he hit someone up at the gym for some under the counter yesterday
[7/26/17, 2:40:44 PM] Launchpad: the Tim Ferris Slow Carb Diet has proven to be wildly effective for 100% of group chat members who have tried this diet
[7/26/17, 2:41:36 PM] Justin: why cant you just take the i agree parts and be happy with those
[7/26/17, 2:41:44 PM] Justin: why do you have to prove the unprovable?
[7/26/17, 2:41:55 PM] Justin: specifically when the data is very against you
[7/26/17, 2:42:10 PM] Justin: like carbs make you eat more carbs-----agreed
[7/26/17, 2:42:26 PM] Justin: a diet rich in protein and low GI carbs is good and makes you feel more full- agreed
[7/26/17, 2:43:18 PM] Justin: you for some reason need to somehow make erroneous conclusions from  those above two statements.
[7/26/17, 2:44:10 PM] Justin: you drinking 2 beers a day of useless carbs while lsoing weight should be enough to disprove extending thsoe statements to where you extend them
[7/26/17, 2:44:14 PM] Launchpad: my underlying assertion is there is more to losing weight than just counting calories -- there are other varaiables at play
[7/26/17, 2:52:54 PM] Justin: and the science says for optimal body composition sure.....otherewise there are varying degrees of success in terms of low fat/high fat  low carb/high carb.....but the glaring consistency is caloric depression leads to weight loss
[7/26/17, 2:54:06 PM] Justin: sugar has plenty of terrible other effects which also cause the increase in appetite by replacing your good bacteria with bad bacteria in colon and stomach
[7/26/17, 2:54:17 PM] Launchpad: I have never denied caloric depression leads to weight loss. I have just concluded that it is not the single and only factor that matters
[7/26/17, 2:54:48 PM] Brian Katz: Idk what herman is arguing about, but kenny lost 80 lbs I've lost 84lbs and you lost 60lbs for a grand total of 224lbs. Herman looks like he's gained weight so read as many articles as you want that support your carb beliefs Herm. I'll stick with Tim Ferriss.
[7/26/17, 2:55:33 PM] Justin: Lp this is when you are supposed to step in and say im proud of herman
[7/26/17, 2:55:51 PM] Justin: he took it upon himself to lose 30 pounds, that shouldnt be demonzied or picked on
[7/26/17, 2:59:19 PM] Justin: and just forced my hand at a midday mid week weigh in at 237.8, ate taco bell last 2 days and mcdonalds
[7/26/17, 2:59:37 PM] Justin: freddie aint dead he says bring it
[7/26/17, 3:00:21 PM] Brian Katz: Lol, get it Herm
[7/26/17, 3:00:33 PM] Brian Katz: Taco Bell is gross tough
[7/26/17, 3:01:16 PM] Justin: well now that fast food is back in diet, im sure weight loss will get back on track
[7/26/17, 3:01:32 PM] Justin: shes been craving that spicy double chalupa
[7/26/17, 3:01:43 PM] Justin: i experimented with donks just get some taco bell chicken soft tacos
[7/26/17, 3:01:48 PM] Brian Katz: Had that on Saturday, super gross
[7/26/17, 3:02:15 PM] Justin: chicken soft tacos way overpriced fwiw
[7/26/17, 3:02:25 PM] Justin: 2$ for a taco at taco bell... gtfo here
[7/26/17, 3:02:40 PM] Brian Katz: Really? That's robbery
[7/26/17, 3:02:58 PM] Justin: yeh i remember when tacos were like 59 cents
[7/26/17, 3:03:11 PM] Justin: and could get 10 pack for like 6$
[7/26/17, 3:06:03 PM] Justin: Btw anyone looking for some insanely good macos/ great tasting ice cream.
[7/26/17, 3:06:48 PM] Justin: 33% protein
[7/26/17, 3:06:51 PM] Justin: Lol
[7/26/17, 3:07:01 PM] Justin: Didn't know you found this shit was directing it at you mostly
[7/26/17, 3:07:03 PM] Justin: Lol
[7/26/17, 3:07:23 PM] Justin: It's incredible how much it tastes like actual ice cream
[7/26/17, 3:07:44 PM] Brian Katz: Jill eats that stuff. Is it any good?
[7/26/17, 3:08:33 PM] Launchpad: ive had it, pretty good
[7/26/17, 3:08:35 PM] Justin: Tastes amazing . Entire pint has less calories than 2 slices of bread and it's decent proportion protein
[7/26/17, 3:09:09 PM] Launchpad: and @16316620763 it is great that you lost 30 pounds....we bicker cause (most of us) have jobs that are boring and we need a distraction
[7/26/17, 3:13:35 PM] Launchpad: lmao
[7/26/17, 3:13:35 PM] Miller: red velvet was meh, oatmeal cookie is the best one ive had so far
[7/26/17, 3:13:40 PM] Launchpad: that started the sea salt discussion
[7/26/17, 3:13:46 PM] Miller: salted caramel pretty good
[7/26/17, 3:14:18 PM] Launchpad: salted caramel was good -- sounds like the flavor I would have gotten
[7/26/17, 3:42:20 PM] Brian Katz: C the admiral 
PF Lebron 
SF sir Charles 
SG Jordan 
PG CP3
[7/26/17, 3:42:38 PM] Miller: lol cmon in what world is barkely a small forward?
[7/26/17, 3:42:55 PM] Brian Katz: Who'd you start over him?
[7/26/17, 3:43:06 PM] Miller: anyways the correct answer is
1 - lebron
2- mj
3 - kobe
4 - durant
5 - robinson
[7/26/17, 3:43:26 PM] Brian Katz: Lots of scoring but you soft on D
[7/26/17, 3:43:44 PM] Brian Katz: Charles was a monster boarder and could score as well
[7/26/17, 3:44:06 PM] Brian Katz: Kobe and Jordan on the court at once wouldn't work
[7/26/17, 3:45:05 PM] Brian Katz: With my starting 5 no team would score more than 55 on the USA
[7/26/17, 3:45:37 PM] Miller: you wouldnt score enough
[7/26/17, 3:45:40 PM] Miller: in no way can you leave durant off
[7/26/17, 3:45:48 PM] Brian Katz: Of course I can
[7/26/17, 3:45:55 PM] Miller: you think barkely is gonna be able to keep with an athletic 3
[7/26/17, 3:46:29 PM] Brian Katz: Why do I need more scoring? I need boarding and D, pulse sir Charles was an elite scorer in the old NBA
[7/26/17, 3:46:49 PM] Brian Katz: He jammed like an animal
[7/26/17, 3:47:18 PM] Brian Katz: Anyone think that grey worm sex scene was super unnecessary?
[7/26/17, 3:48:46 PM] Miller: its GOT gratuioutous sex scenes are a staple
[7/26/17, 3:48:49 PM] Sean: Nope I think it showed her love for him dick or no dick
[7/26/17, 3:49:13 PM] Sean: Also finally showed his vulnerability
[7/26/17, 3:50:00 PM] Miller: unnecessary is bringing a whip to a swordfight
[7/26/17, 3:50:31 PM] Brian Katz: Euron is my man. Anyone else about cersi and her crew?
[7/26/17, 3:51:12 PM] Sean: I mean I love to hate them
[7/26/17, 3:51:36 PM] Sean: I'm all about my queen Khaleesi
[7/26/17, 3:51:41 PM] Sean: I hope her and snow fuck
[7/26/17, 3:51:48 PM] Brian Katz: I don't hate Euron at all. He's my new favorite character
[7/26/17, 3:51:53 PM] Brian Katz: That's his aunt
[7/26/17, 3:52:14 PM] Donk: yeah, but banging their own family members are what targaryans do
[7/26/17, 3:52:23 PM] Brian Katz: Still gross
[7/26/17, 3:52:38 PM] Donk: ride dragons by day, fuck their siblings by night
[7/26/17, 3:53:12 PM] Launchpad: spoilers!
[7/26/17, 3:53:13 PM] Miller: and lannisters
[7/26/17, 3:53:23 PM] Brian Katz: Btw I think the dead will walk across the the ocean
[7/26/17, 3:53:33 PM] Brian Katz: And avoid the wall altogether
[7/26/17, 3:53:42 PM] Donk: mostly thats cersei always wanted to be a targaryn - she dreamed of marrying rhaegar as a girl
[7/26/17, 3:53:46 PM] Miller: anyone think that crossbow was fucking stupid?
[7/26/17, 3:53:53 PM] Brian Katz: No
[7/26/17, 3:54:12 PM] Donk: what was funny to me was when they were like "we are working on it" and then its just a giant crossbow
[7/26/17, 3:54:13 PM] Miller: im sure it works well if you are 5 ft away from an unmoving dragon
[7/26/17, 3:54:17 PM] Brian Katz: One of the original three dragons was killed with a spear in dorne
[7/26/17, 3:54:18 PM] Miller: seriously
[7/26/17, 3:54:20 PM] Donk: i thought it would be some wildfire type shit
[7/26/17, 3:54:22 PM] Miller: i expected something way more impressive
[7/26/17, 3:54:42 PM] Launchpad: Yall gotta watch Twin Peaks so I have someone to talk to...

[7/26/17, 3:56:15 PM] Donk: i watched the pilot of the old one, but never made it further than that
[7/26/17, 3:56:15 PM] Brian Katz: I rewatched weekend at bernies..... movie is genius even now lol

[7/26/17, 4:16:27 PM] Brian Katz: He's in football purgatory now
[7/26/17, 4:16:52 PM] Launchpad: Can they protect his puppy?
[7/26/17, 6:48:35 PM] Justin: Can't verify that meme without a proper legend key
[7/26/17, 6:49:37 PM] Brian Katz: I don't think she owns North America.
[7/26/17, 6:50:09 PM] Launchpad: She owns Canada
[7/26/17, 6:50:47 PM] Brian Katz: Not French Canada
[7/26/17, 6:50:59 PM] Brian Katz: I'm guessing
[7/26/17, 6:56:14 PM] Justin: Because Steve/ sean going away on 10th and they bring the party, im  gonna go out for a herman/joia co birthday party bash at beer garden next friday  the 4th

[7/26/17, 7:10:58 PM] Justin: ite i guess ill be there at 4
[7/26/17, 7:11:02 PM] Justin: which means probably 445
[7/26/17, 8:30:35 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/26/17, 9:04:18 PM] Brian Katz: Damn
[7/26/17, 9:12:53 PM] Launchpad: Bigotry is bad....but threatening mass murder is probably not a good idea...
[7/26/17, 9:22:03 PM] Justin: ......
[7/26/17, 9:22:38 PM] Justin: took a pretty simple search for word kill....hyperbole is hyperbole
[7/26/17, 9:28:26 PM] Brian Katz: That's more of a they should be ashamed if they lose this election, rather than they ought to be killed Herm
[7/26/17, 9:29:16 PM] Miller: Not to mention the difference in saying something here vs on Facebook
[7/26/17, 9:29:43 PM] Justin: yeh its super feasable to be able to bomb states
[7/26/17, 9:29:58 PM] Justin: mountain out of a mole hill
[7/26/17, 9:30:08 PM] Brian Katz: He was saying they should bomb these states is the point
[7/26/17, 9:30:21 PM] Justin: people are so stupid theey should be bombed
[7/26/17, 9:30:26 PM] Justin: emocrats are so shitty they should die
[7/26/17, 9:30:29 PM] Justin: please explian more
[7/26/17, 9:30:33 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty was was saying the Democratic Party should be ashamed two different things
[7/26/17, 9:30:36 PM] Miller: Is it super feasible for me to kill the president?
[7/26/17, 9:30:39 PM] Miller: Probably not
[7/26/17, 9:30:55 PM] Miller: Should I say that I want to?
[7/26/17, 9:31:04 PM] Miller: Still probably not
[7/26/17, 9:31:37 PM] Justin: if yoyur argument is it isnt smart...fine
[7/26/17, 9:32:25 PM] Miller: Not smart, also not a great message to be spreading
[7/26/17, 9:32:44 PM] Miller: I dont love trump, but I also don't think his supporters deserve to die
[7/26/17, 9:34:17 PM] Justin: do you yhink they are as dumb as shit?
[7/26/17, 9:34:23 PM] Justin: like a literal pile of shit
[7/26/17, 9:34:55 PM] Justin: why would you take a statement that is imposisble to exceute literally
[7/26/17, 9:34:59 PM] Justin: thats meant to be an exaggeration
[7/26/17, 9:35:03 PM] Miller: No, I can't imagine anyone with the intelligence of literal feces could have managed to vote
[7/26/17, 9:35:13 PM] Miller: Feasibility is irrelevant
[7/26/17, 9:35:26 PM] Miller: If you don't see a problem with that message then that's fine
[7/26/17, 9:35:49 PM] Miller: It's no better than any of the alt right shit
[7/26/17, 9:36:06 PM] Justin: ok
[7/26/17, 9:36:24 PM] Justin: false equvialency is everywhere so why not
[7/26/17, 9:37:19 PM] Miller: Lol sort of like how Hillary was just as bad so you should just vote for Jill stein? That kind of false equivalency or na?
[7/26/17, 9:37:35 PM] Brian Katz: What reed is on the IR btw?
[7/26/17, 9:37:41 PM] Justin: thats perfect example
[7/26/17, 9:37:59 PM] Justin: comnsdiering i voted for stein becuase my vote didnt matter
[7/26/17, 9:38:01 PM] Miller: I honestly cannot even think of another Reed katz
[7/26/17, 9:38:04 PM] Justin: but comtuniue w false equivalency
[7/26/17, 9:38:08 PM] Miller: Addison Reed?
[7/26/17, 9:38:13 PM] Brian Katz: The te?
[7/26/17, 9:38:17 PM] Miller: Yea

[7/26/17, 9:38:44 PM] Donk: Andre reid?
[7/26/17, 9:41:01 PM] Brian Katz: Ed reed
[7/26/17, 9:42:41 PM] Miller: While everyone on the Ravens is dying at an alarming rate were you really concerned that former Ravens Db was trying to make a comeback but had injured himself?
[7/26/17, 9:44:30 PM] Brian Katz: Yes
[7/26/17, 9:44:38 PM] Brian Katz: Cause he's from the U
[7/26/17, 9:44:48 PM] Miller: Pretty surprised his coaching career never went anywhere
[7/26/17, 9:45:02 PM] Miller: Seemed like he would have been awesome at that
[7/26/17, 9:45:12 PM] Brian Katz: Great players rarely make good coaches
[7/26/17, 9:45:42 PM] Miller: Him and Ray were just so intelligent about the way they played, idk seemed like it would translate
[7/26/17, 9:46:16 PM] Brian Katz: True, but few he their drive and effort.
[7/26/17, 9:57:12 PM] Tk: Flacco got injured liftingüòí. Why??
[7/26/17, 10:07:08 PM] Steve: http://pix11.com/2017/07/26/rikers-on-lockdown-after-prisoner-escapes/
[7/26/17, 10:08:21 PM] Steve: That guy know he's on an island? Do I know I'm on an island? So many questions...ü§î
[7/26/17, 10:11:03 PM] Miller: Alcatraz was an island and sean Connery escaped from that shit
[7/26/17, 10:11:24 PM] Steve: But that's 007
[7/26/17, 10:38:52 PM] Launchpad: Interesting https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/9kw4mz/guy-killed-by-alien-in-alien-now-believes-hes-seen-real-aliens?utm_campaign=Global&utm_source=vicefbca
[7/26/17, 10:50:42 PM] Sean: Oh dayum no wonder the helicopters were crazy before
[7/27/17, 7:38:38 AM] Brian Katz: He's the man, and his stories are great. He's spent more on spilt drinks from one end of this country to the other, than you make in a year. He's custom made from head to toe. High profiling, private jet flying, kiss stealing, son of a gun. That's why his jacket costs $800 and he doesn't know how much yours costs, he'd be embarrassed to wear it.
[7/27/17, 8:30:07 AM] Miller: damn whatsapp has 1B avg daily users
[7/27/17, 8:30:58 AM] Miller: even more surprising is the whatsapp status/snapchat clone has 250m daily users (snapchat only has 160m)
[7/27/17, 8:33:48 AM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[7/27/17, 9:13:25 AM] Miller: damn kimyes surrogate is only getting 45k? i thought the going rate for these was like 60-70k and i assumed for a celebrity surrogtate it would easily be 6 figures
[7/27/17, 9:17:40 AM] Brian Katz: What's a kimyes?
[7/27/17, 9:19:05 AM] Brian Katz: Who cares
[7/27/17, 9:19:46 AM] Miller: probably lots of people
[7/27/17, 9:22:27 AM] Brian Katz: I could never hear anything else about these people ever again, and be completely content.
[7/27/17, 9:32:30 AM] Brian Katz: Maybe I should release a sex tape with ray j
[7/27/17, 9:32:44 AM] Miller: almost certainly would help your social media game
[7/27/17, 9:32:45 AM] Brian Katz: And people are stupid
[7/27/17, 9:33:11 AM] Miller: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prontobev-chill-beverages-in-30-seconds-coffee-tea#/ probably just wasted $100 but w/e
[7/27/17, 9:37:41 AM] Brian Katz: Jill has a similar thing that just schools the bottle. It works well
[7/27/17, 9:38:49 AM] Miller: i have that one but it uses ice
[7/27/17, 9:38:54 AM] Miller: which i never have enough of
[7/27/17, 10:15:36 AM] Launchpad: http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/26/amazon-1492-secret-health-tech-project.html

[7/27/17, 10:42:09 AM] Miller: http://www.gq.com/story/john-mccain-is-the-perfect-american-lie first time ever seeing drew write about politics
[7/27/17, 10:50:50 AM] Justin: Just saw headline on tv. "Julio Jones pays 100k for divers to find earring"
[7/27/17, 10:51:28 AM] Donk: that headline is a bit messed up
[7/27/17, 10:51:45 AM] Donk: it should be julio jones hires divers to find 100k earring
[7/27/17, 10:52:22 AM] Miller: how much did that earring possibly cost
[7/27/17, 10:52:35 AM] Launchpad: Verizon stock up 6.26%
[7/27/17, 10:53:25 AM] Brian Katz: Is the first preseason game tonight?
[7/27/17, 10:53:47 AM] Miller: launchpad i put all my $ into astra zeneca with their 6.6% yield and its now down 15% today and now im broke
[7/27/17, 10:53:48 AM] Miller: thanks a lot

[7/27/17, 11:23:59 AM] Launchpad: Booker suffered a hairline fracture in his wrist during OTAs and is expected to miss at least six weeks while recovering from surgery. He's in serious danger of missing Week 1, which helps Jamaal Charles' chances of earning a roster spot and a significant role.
[7/27/17, 11:24:36 AM] Brian Katz: That's great
[7/27/17, 11:25:47 AM] Launchpad: that was supposed to be CJA
[7/27/17, 11:29:35 AM] Launchpad: DT Dontari Poe collects a $125,000 bonus after weighing in at/below 330 pounds for camp. This the second of four weigh-in bonuses worth $125,000 each in the language of his contract

[7/27/17, 3:08:02 PM] Launchpad: Just plugged in this echo I got 2 weeks ago for the first time
[7/27/17, 3:10:07 PM] Brian Katz: Is that the end of your story?

[7/27/17, 5:39:03 PM] Miller: Scaramucci if nothing else is massively entertaining
[7/27/17, 5:39:07 PM] Miller: hes fucking nuts
[7/27/17, 5:39:17 PM] Miller: ‚ÄúReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,‚Äù Scaramucci told New Yorker writer Ryan Lizza in a Wednesday phone call. 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll all be fired by me,‚Äù he said of the White House communications staff. ‚ÄúI fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I‚Äôll fire tomorrow. I‚Äôll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus ‚Äî if you want to leak something ‚Äî he‚Äôll be asked to resign very shortly.‚Äù
[7/27/17, 5:39:24 PM] Miller: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Steve Bannon, I‚Äôm not trying to suck my own cock,‚Äù Scaramucci reportedly told The New Yorker‚Äôs Ryan Lizza, according to an account of the explosive phone call published Thursday.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to build my own brand off the f---ing strength of the president. I‚Äôm here to serve the country,‚Äù Scaramucci continued on the call.
[7/27/17, 5:59:44 PM] Launchpad: pretty crazy

[7/27/17, 6:10:01 PM] Donk: yeah ive heard good things about it
[7/27/17, 6:20:13 PM] Justin: I'm all for foul language but there is a bit of irony in that being the language of the communications director for the White House
[7/27/17, 6:38:20 PM] Steve: Scaramucci, skipping leg day just to run his mouth.
[7/27/17, 7:09:24 PM] Steve: Duda traded

[7/27/17, 8:39:08 PM] Launchpad: I know about index funds and ETFs thanks for your concern though
[7/27/17, 8:43:20 PM] Miller: Wasn't concerned, seemed like an episode you would be interested in, if not feel free to ignore it
[7/27/17, 8:43:56 PM] Launchpad: gotcha...thought you were trolling my stock picking
[7/27/17, 9:55:26 PM] Launchpad: I would agree that index funds / ETFs / passive investing is best for most people
[7/28/17, 1:37:07 AM] Justin: I'm still a victim because of McCain
[7/28/17, 5:32:50 AM] Miller: Second time this week but this time probably a little more fitting.... Our long national nightmare is over

[7/28/17, 8:20:33 AM] Miller: that was the other day, he voted yes on the motion to proceed which was what started this chaos of vote-o-rama we had the last few days
[7/28/17, 8:20:49 AM] Miller: he voted no on the skinny repeal bill last night @ 130am
[7/28/17, 8:22:11 AM] Kiyoon: Is debate and motion to proceed the same thing
[7/28/17, 8:22:45 AM] Steve: The motion was for a debate or not

[7/28/17, 8:23:04 AM] Kiyoon: Yeah, check the Noah segment
[7/28/17, 8:23:16 AM] Steve: Then they put 2 or 3 bills on the floor and voted on them
[7/28/17, 8:26:49 AM] Miller: yes essentially voting "for" a debate is the same thing as voting for the motion to proceed, just wording
[7/28/17, 10:11:42 AM] Miller: long shot but does anyone want to go see the bleachers @ terminal 5 on 11/20? tickets $40

[7/29/17, 12:06:41 PM] Launchpad: Dark blue would be good with lighter jeans or opposite
[7/29/17, 12:06:42 PM] Launchpad: just make sure you iron that shirt first
[7/29/17, 12:06:42 PM] Scott: Internal medicine.

[7/29/17, 12:07:42 PM] Steve: Go cholo Los Angeles
[7/29/17, 12:07:47 PM] Miller: Agreed

[7/29/17, 12:08:01 PM] Miller: A bandana would really tie it together
[7/29/17, 12:08:07 PM] Steve: Wear a white vneck tshirt underneath
[7/29/17, 12:08:16 PM] Launchpad: ü§£
[7/29/17, 12:08:17 PM] Steve: Show that chest hair

[7/29/17, 12:10:12 PM] Launchpad: Might want to spend some time in the gym too
[7/29/17, 12:10:29 PM] Miller: Wow
[7/29/17, 12:10:32 PM] Steve: Who shops for a 3rd date because "he has no clothes"
[7/29/17, 12:10:33 PM] James  L: Hospital doctors want to fuck so your more relaxed private practice is more up right right in your alley cheese more proper dress
[7/29/17, 12:10:50 PM] Steve: Mad sophisticated and happening
[7/29/17, 12:11:16 PM] Steve: Cheese doesn't have time for guns
[7/29/17, 12:11:20 PM] Steve: *gyms
[7/29/17, 12:11:32 PM] Launchpad: he has Cheese clothes...this is the right move
[7/29/17, 12:12:31 PM] Steve: He's picking jury's, having 3 hour sex sessions with his soon to be wife, shopping for short sleeved button downs and sending venmo requests for money he owes. No time!
[7/29/17, 12:12:38 PM] Scott: Lop

[7/29/17, 12:42:38 PM] Scott: I wasn't trying to smile.
[7/29/17, 12:42:51 PM] Scott: Shit was serious.
[7/29/17, 1:53:28 PM] Scott: This friends from college show is extremely mediocre.  I concur with prior comments about it
[7/29/17, 2:02:33 PM] Launchpad: we should make our own shoe
[7/29/17, 2:02:47 PM] Launchpad: a half hour of ripping on Cheese each week is pure comedy gold
[7/29/17, 2:02:55 PM] Scott: Should we?  I think not.
[7/29/17, 2:08:32 PM] Miller: Okay lavar ball
[7/29/17, 2:11:50 PM] Justin: For future reference.....asking the girl at the store, literally any girl, would have been infinitely more productive than this
[7/29/17, 2:12:12 PM] Scott: Maybe.
[7/29/17, 2:16:16 PM] Miller: No way that's how launchpad got stuck spending $300 to look like a Persian nightclub owner
[7/29/17, 2:16:52 PM] Scott: I was at the gap. They don't sell that garbage there.
[7/29/17, 2:34:12 PM] Launchpad: high school kids cant afford persian night club shrts
[7/29/17, 2:34:31 PM] Scott: Rich high school kids can.
[7/29/17, 2:36:15 PM] Launchpad: they'll still stuff you in a locker
[7/29/17, 2:36:31 PM] Scott: False.
[7/29/17, 6:24:04 PM] Tk: Anyone know whos # this is 845-521-9550?
[7/29/17, 6:25:01 PM] Kiyoon: Nothing on my contacts

[7/29/17, 6:45:14 PM] Brian Katz: These hoes
[7/29/17, 8:49:54 PM] Brian Katz: Watching this documentary. Apparently prescription drugs are quit addictive. It's pretty insane how many people die because of them.
[7/29/17, 9:09:54 PM] Kiyoon: Yeah man that's why I barely took the oxycodone for my ankle
[7/29/17, 9:09:57 PM] Kiyoon: F that shit
[7/29/17, 9:14:02 PM] Brian Katz: Watching a documentary on crossfit now, @16316620763 why the hate on this? This looks great
[7/29/17, 9:16:28 PM] Justin: I recommended it to you...
[7/29/17, 9:17:10 PM] Brian Katz: Are you being sarcastic? I thought you weren't a fan?
[7/29/17, 9:18:07 PM] Justin: I'm not a fan in general. It's really shitty if not done properly. But it fits the criteria you seemed to want, hence recommended it.
[7/29/17, 9:18:59 PM] Justin: Even mentioned my old powerlifting gym owner stared lifting at a crossfit
[7/29/17, 9:20:45 PM] Justin: If done correctly and not half assed it's functionally about doing all the Olympic lifts in a circuit format....which is much better than doing some random 4 days of back arms abs chest
[7/29/17, 9:21:35 PM] Brian Katz: I see
[7/30/17, 3:14:25 PM] Justin: Now that's an update

[7/31/17, 9:11:14 AM] Kiyoon: Why would you say that
[7/31/17, 9:11:27 AM] Kiyoon: Some of us haven't seen the ep
[7/31/17, 9:25:06 AM] Brian Katz: My bad, what did you do instead of watching thrones?
[7/31/17, 9:29:03 AM] Kiyoon: In Korea visiting Fam and sight seeing
[7/31/17, 9:30:30 AM] Steve: Oh snap
[7/31/17, 9:30:33 AM] Steve: How is the trip?
[7/31/17, 9:31:03 AM] Brian Katz: They don't have thrones in Korea?
[7/31/17, 9:37:16 AM] Brian Katz: Also what time is it over there?
[7/31/17, 9:40:34 AM] Kiyoon: They do, just haven't had time to sit down for an hour and watch tv
[7/31/17, 9:40:39 AM] Kiyoon: 10 40 ay might
[7/31/17, 9:40:45 AM] Kiyoon: At night*  monday

[7/31/17, 2:35:07 PM] Miller: President Trump has decided to remove Anthony Scaramucci from his position as communications director, three people close to the decision said Monday
[7/31/17, 2:35:56 PM] Launchpad: lol that was quick
[7/31/17, 2:37:18 PM] Miller: so funny
[7/31/17, 2:37:31 PM] Miller: i called it, as soon as you start getitng too much press or attention trump gets jealous
[7/31/17, 2:38:00 PM] Steve: Or you start telling him people on his staff are sucking their own cocks
[7/31/17, 2:45:01 PM] Dan Watts: Damn I liked mooch
[7/31/17, 2:47:59 PM] Steve: It's also telling how much power bannon has
[7/31/17, 3:00:12 PM] Miller: Source: Gray to Yankees done. Fowler, Mateo, Kaprelian coming back.
[7/31/17, 3:00:40 PM] Steve: Not an awful awful lot
[7/31/17, 3:00:47 PM] Steve: Kaprelian will hurt
[7/31/17, 3:01:03 PM] Steve: Mateo, we have a lot jam at middle infield
[7/31/17, 3:01:10 PM] Steve: Especially with Torres next year
[7/31/17, 3:01:18 PM] Miller: only one top 100 guy
[7/31/17, 3:01:19 PM] Miller: seems cheap
[7/31/17, 3:01:42 PM] Steve: I'm surprised it wasn't more
[7/31/17, 3:01:48 PM] Steve: Honestly they didn't have to trade him now
[7/31/17, 3:01:55 PM] Steve: He's cheap for two more years
[7/31/17, 3:02:33 PM] Brian Katz: Does darvish get traded too?
[7/31/17, 3:02:51 PM] Steve: Still an hour left until the deadline
[7/31/17, 3:03:08 PM] Steve: Darvish to the dodgers seems like it fell through
[7/31/17, 3:03:54 PM] Miller: rangers sounded committed to trading him
[7/31/17, 3:04:19 PM] Miller: wonder if teams were waiting on gray to be done 1st then moving on to yu
[7/31/17, 3:09:00 PM] Brian Katz: We'll cutting it close
[7/31/17, 3:09:12 PM] Brian Katz: Well*

[7/31/17, 3:55:59 PM] Dan Watts: Do we know anyone who does web design professionally?
[7/31/17, 3:56:36 PM] Miller: kind of a deep cut but i could put you in touch, nicoles friend amy, her bf phil does
[7/31/17, 3:57:38 PM] Launchpad: JT does
[7/31/17, 3:57:48 PM] Launchpad: What's your budget?
[7/31/17, 4:01:04 PM] Tk: First Priubus now Scaramuchi, Trump dont know it yet a Pence and Gen Kelly coup is in the works.
[7/31/17, 4:17:24 PM] Miller: wow darvish to the dodgers at the absolute last minute
[7/31/17, 5:50:12 PM] Miller: i sent an email but since some of you seemingly dont know how to use email ill post it in here also, celebrating the kids birthdays 9/16 in westhampton, idk exact starting time yet, formal invitation to come later but just figured i would give people a heads up earlier.
I know it's a pretty long trip for a lot of you, no hard feelings if you cannot make it.
If you know for sure one way or the other you can RSVP to me or text me whenever, dont need to know for another month or so.

any questions (that were not covered in the 4 sentences above) lmk
[7/31/17, 5:50:31 PM] Launchpad: Can't make it
[7/31/17, 5:51:56 PM] Miller: Forgot I even invited you tbh
[7/31/17, 5:52:04 PM] Miller: Formal invitation will not be coming
[7/31/17, 5:52:34 PM] Sean: I'm there with Michael
[7/31/17, 5:53:04 PM] Launchpad: that hows I end up invited to most parties
[7/31/17, 5:55:09 PM] Dan Watts: I'll be there
[7/31/17, 6:51:58 PM] Brian Katz: Jill an I are there
[7/31/17, 8:54:02 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[7/31/17, 8:56:53 PM] Scott: Lol. Half truth

[8/1/17, 12:06:58 PM] Justin: Nice
[8/1/17, 12:07:13 PM] Donk: how many contests is that really restricting if it has to meet both qualificaitons?
[8/1/17, 12:07:35 PM] Justin: Well on aggregate million isn't all that much
[8/1/17, 12:08:13 PM] Launchpad: thats a good idea
[8/1/17, 12:08:35 PM] Justin: Still pretty large More I think of it
[8/1/17, 12:09:04 PM] Justin: Also funny how if poker made such a rule I'd be talking about how much bullshit it is.
[8/1/17, 12:09:56 PM] Launchpad: what limits are you playing these days?
[8/1/17, 12:12:04 PM] Justin: Low. But on aggregate I gamble couple hundred k a year
[8/1/17, 12:12:13 PM] Brian Katz: Are you currently holding them or folding them?
[8/1/17, 12:12:52 PM] Justin: Definitely don't know when to walk away
[8/1/17, 12:17:12 PM] Launchpad: in poker you still need to sit at the table and play the hands -- with DFS you can just have a program submit your lineup to any competition in seconds
[8/1/17, 12:17:49 PM] Justin: Fair. Poker already done the skill separation on certain sites.
[8/1/17, 12:19:48 PM] Justin: I mean it's the same logic behind the draftkings. The thing is they could in theory make scripts illegal, if it was just about the automation.
[8/1/17, 12:21:20 PM] Justin: They make so much money from the scripts though.
[8/1/17, 12:50:14 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/1/17, 1:12:06 PM] Miller: Cowboys Jerry Jones to Players: ‚ÄúStand For the Anthem or You‚Äôre Off the Team‚Äù
[8/1/17, 1:18:58 PM] Dan Watts: üá∫üá∏
[8/1/17, 1:45:27 PM] Brian Katz: Unless you're really good, then you can do whatever
[8/1/17, 1:46:19 PM] Miller: Would love to see dez kneel, you know they wouldn't do shit
[8/1/17, 1:47:03 PM] Brian Katz: They'd praise him for it
[8/1/17, 1:48:02 PM] Launchpad: If he kneeled for PETA and hes kicked off the team, is it racism?
[8/1/17, 3:04:57 PM] Justin: Curious what's under line?
[8/1/17, 3:28:18 PM] Miller: Don't remember, closed it, probably plus 120 or something
[8/1/17, 4:35:13 PM] Miller: yo @16072459839 wtf is going on
[8/1/17, 4:35:13 PM] Miller: Ravens fourth-round OG Nico Siragusa has been diagnosed with a torn left ACL, MCL and PCL, and is done for the season.
Devastating. The No. 122 overall pick had been getting some first-team reps at the Ravens' unsettled left guard position. Now he'll be settling in for what will probably be a year-long rehab. Siragusa has impressive college film and measurables, but was old for a rookie. He will be a 24-year-old sophomore with a shredded knee in 2018. Enduring an unfathomable run of injuries, the Ravens have lost seven players for the season since June 1
[8/1/17, 4:40:21 PM] Donk: is that tony siragusa's son?
[8/1/17, 4:40:44 PM] Donk: ha just googled him and his wiki page says this:  Despite his surname and football prowess, Nico has no relation to former NFL defensive tackle and Fox Sports broadcaster Tony Siragusa.[5] His parents are Ramon and Dianne Siragusa.[6]
[8/1/17, 4:41:18 PM] Donk: (though when i googled him and saw he wasn't white, that was a pretty good tip off too)
[8/1/17, 6:08:29 PM] Tk: So is our back up Te Gilmore. Out for the season also. Same shit like last year.
[8/1/17, 6:09:16 PM] Tk: Its still early enough to  decent replacements but def not a good trend.
[8/1/17, 6:46:17 PM] James  L: Doesn't matter we know who is the king of the north
[8/1/17, 6:46:42 PM] Steve: For this year
[8/1/17, 6:46:53 PM] Steve: They better resign leveon
[8/1/17, 6:46:58 PM] Launchpad: the browns?

[8/1/17, 7:48:29 PM] James  L: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/1/17, 7:49:03 PM] Steve: At least he marked it for you
[8/1/17, 7:49:44 PM] Miller: Is it possible it's 2 different people
[8/1/17, 7:50:09 PM] James  L: Almost fought a guy last week tried to say his dog shits three times and he picks it all up on the way back... called me the shit police
[8/1/17, 7:51:23 PM] James  L: Could be but the other person needs to reevaluate his life if he's looking for dog shit to put trump flags in it
[8/1/17, 7:51:27 PM] Steve: Better or worse than being the taxi squad police?
[8/1/17, 7:52:10 PM] Steve: That's a civic service if he is @16465236894 returning that face to its rightful owner
[8/2/17, 8:52:00 AM] Steve: @17189742074 looks like a case you might want to be a part of: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/doj-eyes-discrimination-white-applicants-colleges-article-1.3376035

[8/2/17, 1:53:09 PM] Launchpad: If he leaves his wife for a dude and moves to Brooklyn - they could call the show Queen of Kings  üíÅüèª

[8/2/17, 5:52:05 PM] Launchpad: sort of like Lending Club, except the loans are backed by real estate
[8/3/17, 7:51:10 AM] Miller: http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/20211833/nba-bust-darko-milicic-finds-success-back-home-serbia surprisingly well done story from ESPN
[8/3/17, 9:02:33 AM] Brian Katz: I wish they'd explain more on how he did that.
[8/3/17, 9:03:15 AM] Miller: in the link he talks about just keeping his T levels high and eating lots of brazil nuts
[8/3/17, 9:06:28 AM] Brian Katz: Well yeah, that's without question.
[8/3/17, 10:11:08 AM] Launchpad: on the gym tv,  they cycle through random shit.  Yesterday,  they mentioned Brazil nuts and listed random facts
[8/3/17, 10:11:33 AM] Launchpad: Highest occurring natural source of selenium
[8/3/17, 10:12:25 AM] Launchpad: I guess fertility and testosterone are unrelated though
[8/3/17, 10:12:41 AM] Miller: you in an uber?
[8/3/17, 10:13:32 AM] Launchpad: Lol
[8/3/17, 10:14:04 AM] Launchpad: I'm sure lifting weights and building muscle does nothing for testosterone either really
[8/3/17, 10:42:45 AM] Miller: not that i hope for anyone to be injured, but if tanny is hurt and the fins sign cutler instead of kap the taeks are gonna be so hot
[8/3/17, 10:55:31 AM] Justin: http://www.berkeleywellness.com/supplements/minerals/article/selenium-strikes-out
[8/3/17, 10:55:41 AM] Justin: Googled selenium scientific studies
[8/3/17, 10:57:19 AM] Justin: Although article does conclude eat  braziisn nuts if you're gonna do anything
[8/3/17, 10:59:16 AM] Launchpad: ^^ that article was specifically about cancer and cholesterol - not metabolism, fertility
[8/3/17, 10:59:31 AM] Justin: Also true.
[8/3/17, 11:00:12 AM] Miller: at the end of the day its totally reasonable to think a 200lb guy eating 5k/cals per went from 16% BF to 10%
[8/3/17, 11:00:36 AM] Launchpad: i believe it
[8/3/17, 11:01:41 AM] Launchpad: doesn't say how many calories he burned in training
[8/3/17, 11:02:16 AM] Launchpad: and as his muscle mass increases he needs to eat more to sustain the same weight
[8/3/17, 11:02:29 AM] Launchpad: but what do NFL trainers know about anything?
[8/3/17, 11:03:01 AM] Launchpad: probably about the same amount that NFL talent evaporators know about Colin Kapernick
[8/3/17, 2:12:05 PM] Brian Katz: Who are these people?
[8/3/17, 2:12:28 PM] Miller: kimye

[8/3/17, 4:28:25 PM] Miller: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing Russia‚Äôs interference in 2016 U.S. elections as well as possible collusion with Trump campaign, has impaneled a grand jury, WSJ reports.
[8/3/17, 4:28:36 PM] Justin: wow

[8/3/17, 7:51:01 PM] Launchpad: a couple months ago I posted a Tinder chat with the model line that ive used a bunch of times and the girl didn't get it and completely went off on me....she didn't write an entire novel, but the message was pathetically the same
[8/3/17, 8:03:00 PM] Justin: So that model line has backfired multiple times.
[8/3/17, 8:05:22 PM] Scott: The model line is...?
[8/3/17, 8:22:07 PM] Launchpad: its actually gotten me more responses than almost anything else

[8/4/17, 11:51:25 AM] Launchpad: lol I've seen that on Vice
[8/4/17, 11:51:40 AM] Launchpad: Cause obviously thats a very Vice headline
[8/4/17, 2:49:25 PM] Launchpad: Decisions decisions https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/28/everything-you-want-to-know-about-the-tesla-model-3/
[8/4/17, 2:56:22 PM] Miller: The Miami Herald reports Dolphins coach Adam Gase "personally" has reached out to "retired" QB Jay Cutler since Ryan Tannehill suffered a potentially year-ending knee injury.
[8/4/17, 2:57:28 PM] Brian Katz: Miami herald reports you should of heard the Marlins joke from Scott Schectner yesterday
[8/4/17, 3:00:08 PM] Launchpad: you throwin shade at my name?
[8/4/17, 3:00:49 PM] Brian Katz: It doesn't matter what your name is
[8/4/17, 3:01:43 PM] Launchpad: Yesterday Steve said he was rebuilding his team and all his players were available.  The Marlins famously win championships and sell off their team afterwards.  Get it? Good.  Now that we all understand it, lets laugh at how clever I am
[8/4/17, 3:02:12 PM] Brian Katz: We're all laughing don't worry
[8/4/17, 3:02:30 PM] Steve: At him?
[8/4/17, 3:02:41 PM] Launchpad: @Brai
[8/4/17, 3:02:53 PM] Brian Katz: You get steve, and I didn't even have to explain it
[8/4/17, 3:02:56 PM] Launchpad: @16318489683 can you explain that one to steve?
[8/4/17, 3:03:25 PM] Brian Katz: No need, He got it
[8/4/17, 3:03:25 PM] Steve: You not being funny?
[8/4/17, 3:03:29 PM] Steve: We get that also
[8/4/17, 3:04:39 PM] Launchpad: Im pretty damn funny
[8/4/17, 3:04:48 PM] Launchpad: I provide hours of entertainment
[8/4/17, 3:06:50 PM] Launchpad: FUCK: All-told, a fully upgraded Model 3 retails for $59,500 before tax or incentives, which is still quite a reasonable deal given what you‚Äôre getting, especially when measured up against comparable gas fuel burning vehicles.
[8/4/17, 3:07:12 PM] Miller: welcome to 1 week ago
[8/4/17, 3:07:26 PM] Miller: im even getting a tesla and i knew that
[8/4/17, 3:07:28 PM] Miller: *not
[8/4/17, 3:07:29 PM] Brian Katz: You own this car yet?
[8/4/17, 3:07:30 PM] Launchpad: lol
[8/4/17, 3:07:44 PM] Launchpad: no they just delivered car #1 a week ago
[8/4/17, 3:08:09 PM] Miller: also launchpad just got really hot and sweaty and has food poisoning
[8/4/17, 3:08:19 PM] Launchpad: I don't think Im going to get it, based on these pricing options
[8/4/17, 3:08:34 PM] Brian Katz: I've never seen anyone so excited about a car that doesn't increase his chance of getting laid. I guess the deal is just that good.
[8/4/17, 3:08:36 PM] Donk: good thing you gave them that loan
[8/4/17, 3:08:46 PM] Launchpad: its refundable
[8/4/17, 3:08:56 PM] Donk: i know
[8/4/17, 3:08:59 PM] Donk: thats why i said loan
[8/4/17, 3:09:08 PM] Donk: and not a gift
[8/4/17, 3:09:12 PM] Launchpad: I might just take that $1k back and put it towards a downpayment on a Mazda 3 lease
[8/4/17, 3:09:21 PM] Launchpad: the one I drove from the dealer for a couple days was sick
[8/4/17, 3:10:03 PM] Miller: what about a car they arent even getting lol
[8/4/17, 3:10:55 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/4/17, 3:11:41 PM] Launchpad: I would say that car might increase my chance of getting laid...by how much who knows
[8/4/17, 3:12:11 PM] Miller: def would
[8/4/17, 3:12:48 PM] Brian Katz: I saw you looking at her. That's right it's a Tesla. I get 200 miles before I have to plug it in. How many miles do you get before you need a plug in baby?
[8/4/17, 3:12:48 PM] Launchpad: but I usually Uber to my dates
[8/4/17, 3:13:22 PM] Launchpad: and if they drive, I have them give me a ride home then I conveniently invite them in once they get there üòâ
[8/4/17, 3:13:43 PM] Brian Katz: And they're all like "nah I'm good"
[8/4/17, 3:14:27 PM] Launchpad: hahaha

[8/4/17, 11:40:49 PM] Dan Watts: But I'm Saratoga anyway
[8/4/17, 11:41:36 PM] Dan Watts: But I don't know why I've been blackballed. What say you @16316620763
[8/4/17, 11:42:19 PM] Dan Watts: I'm very offended
[8/4/17, 11:42:39 PM] Justin: I mean I'm not near Joia but I sent the invite to group chat and actually told Joia you said you were gonna be in Saratoga tomorrow so assumed tonight
[8/4/17, 11:42:53 PM] Justin: But assume does make an ass out of you and me so my bad
[8/4/17, 11:44:09 PM] Dan Watts: I knew nothing of details, I think you systematically excluded me

[8/5/17, 12:49:18 AM] Launchpad: FILO better for partying
[8/5/17, 3:17:57 PM] Launchpad: So last night....I met a girl out at a bar.  Was making out with her at the end of the night....everything normal & going fine.  We get in an Uber to head back to my place, and half way there she freaks out, makes the Uber driver immediately pull over in a slightly sketchy area so she can get out
[8/5/17, 3:19:52 PM] Scott: That's crazy.
[8/5/17, 3:19:55 PM] Scott: What did u do
[8/5/17, 3:20:34 PM] Justin: Must been the implication
[8/5/17, 3:22:25 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty's full of implications
[8/5/17, 3:47:35 PM] Launchpad: lol nothing
[8/5/17, 3:47:41 PM] Launchpad: went home and smoked weed
[8/5/17, 4:19:57 PM] Miller: Def more to this story
[8/5/17, 4:23:16 PM] Scott: True. There's no way she freaked out for no reason and needed to basically jump out of the car.
[8/5/17, 4:25:07 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/5/17, 4:25:37 PM] Scott: Or wash her hair
[8/5/17, 4:25:40 PM] Scott: Or do laundry
[8/5/17, 4:25:59 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/5/17, 4:26:04 PM] Steve: Had to take the dog out
[8/5/17, 4:27:07 PM] Scott: Does she have a dog?
[8/5/17, 4:27:29 PM] Launchpad: She was all about how hot i am and making out with me 15 min earlier
[8/5/17, 4:34:05 PM] Steve: Is she blind?
[8/5/17, 4:34:22 PM] Steve: It's a walking dog!
[8/5/17, 6:57:50 PM] Scott: U mean seeing eye doh
[8/5/17, 6:57:52 PM] Scott: Dog
[8/5/17, 7:53:01 PM] Brian Katz: @13478047760 btw I asked @16313981203 I don't think he thinks you had a good draft
[8/5/17, 8:07:37 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/5/17, 8:20:34 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/5/17, 8:28:28 PM] Steve: @16318489683 you are fake news
[8/5/17, 8:34:06 PM] Brian Katz: @13478047760 I didn't report on anything
[8/5/17, 8:56:56 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/sports/little-league-removes-softball-team-world-series-social-media-post-212434926.html

[8/5/17, 8:58:31 PM] Miller: That's ridiculous
[8/5/17, 8:59:15 PM] Miller: Is there a less offensive thing than the middle finger idk what it is
[8/5/17, 9:04:30 PM] Justin: yeh i think its crazy
[8/5/17, 9:04:42 PM] Justin: thats parents issue/fault
[8/5/17, 9:20:50 PM] Steve: This is reporting of fake news
[8/5/17, 9:36:45 PM] Brian Katz: Show me where kiyoon said you had a good draft
[8/5/17, 9:38:44 PM] Steve: After you show me you talked to him
[8/5/17, 9:45:49 PM] Steve: So you took a screen shot of me saying he's in Korea?
[8/5/17, 9:45:59 PM] Steve: Still not a transcript of him telling you anything
[8/5/17, 9:46:11 PM] Steve: You having a rough Saturday
[8/5/17, 9:50:56 PM] Brian Katz: Him keeping his silence is very telling about how he doesn't think you had a good draft
[8/5/17, 9:51:19 PM] Steve: Keep avoiding your fake news
[8/6/17, 9:53:24 AM] Scott: @15166335046 that Darko story was actually pretty good. I agree.
[8/6/17, 2:49:08 PM] Justin: @16195657200 http://www.pokereum.io/#
[8/7/17, 9:08:09 AM] Miller: https://twitter.com/thewallofmusic/status/894332542324703232 this moonlight video is nuts
[8/7/17, 9:58:01 AM] Launchpad: bout time someone did this -- been discussed for several years now
[8/7/17, 10:19:56 AM] Launchpad: gross http://mashable.com/2017/08/07/despacito-youtube-crown/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial#uLu3jgQaSaqm
[8/7/17, 10:20:09 AM] Launchpad: Just weeks after becoming the most streamed song of all time, "Despacito" has now been crowned with another title.

With just over 3 billion views, the song has officially become the most viewed video in YouTube history.
[8/7/17, 10:21:07 AM] Launchpad: nevermind its the original, not the beiber remix
[8/7/17, 10:34:22 AM] Miller: Odds to win the Super Bowl @southpointlv:
Patriots 11/5
Cowboys 5/1
Packers 10/1
Steelers 10/1
Seahawks 10/1
Falcons 12/1
Raiders 12/1
[8/7/17, 10:38:31 AM] Launchpad: cowboys?? really?
[8/7/17, 10:39:14 AM] Launchpad: they can't even stay not suspended
[8/7/17, 10:40:43 AM] Donk: plenty of cowboys fans out there placing homer bets is the likely scenario
[8/7/17, 10:43:33 AM] Donk: started watching ozark over the weekend, its good
[8/7/17, 10:44:40 AM] Launchpad: yeah I just finished it yesterday
[8/7/17, 10:45:12 AM] Miller: surprised launchpad would watch a show w/a kanye song in the trailer
[8/7/17, 10:45:30 AM] Brian Katz: Anyone watch new Rick and morty yesterday?
[8/7/17, 10:45:46 AM] Miller: on too late for me
[8/7/17, 10:45:46 AM] Donk: not yet, when i get home
[8/7/17, 10:46:00 AM] Donk: yeah 1130 on a sunday seems like a ridiculous time slot
[8/7/17, 10:46:14 AM] Brian Katz: Pickle Rick is a ruthless killer lol
[8/7/17, 10:49:56 AM] Launchpad: Seems reasonable that a show about a guy who is indebted to Mexican drug dealers would use the song of a guy who's indebted to his creditors and needs Mark Zuckerberg to loan him some money
[8/7/17, 11:21:24 AM] Miller: idk who these people are
[8/7/17, 11:21:26 AM] Donk: yeah i saw it earlier
[8/7/17, 11:21:27 AM] Donk: very sad
[8/7/17, 11:21:30 AM] Miller: but that sounds terrible
[8/7/17, 11:21:33 AM] Donk: Brian Henderson = Hindu
[8/7/17, 11:21:52 AM] Miller: sounds vaguely familiar?
[8/7/17, 11:22:05 AM] Donk: he was roommates with Phil and Deezy their freshman year i think
[8/7/17, 11:22:11 AM] Miller: gotcha
[8/7/17, 11:22:18 AM] Donk: or knew them one fo them from home, one or the other, not sure
[8/7/17, 11:24:13 AM] Launchpad: roommates in mountain view
[8/7/17, 11:24:41 AM] Launchpad: Used to come to a lot of our events
[8/7/17, 11:25:11 AM] Miller: im sure, my longer term memory of ppl i didnt keep in any kind of contact w/sucks
[8/7/17, 11:28:20 AM] Steve: Crazy
[8/7/17, 11:28:24 AM] Steve: Wonder how it happened
[8/7/17, 11:28:30 AM] Steve: Either way, incredibly sad
[8/7/17, 11:28:33 AM] Steve: He was a good guy
[8/7/17, 11:28:51 AM] Steve: Kids being left without a father is always sad
[8/7/17, 11:29:06 AM] Launchpad: I'm am going with suicide
[8/7/17, 11:29:18 AM] Miller: thats agressive
[8/7/17, 11:29:33 AM] Steve: Yea, that's a jump
[8/7/17, 11:29:43 AM] Launchpad: he had issues with drugs & probably depression
[8/7/17, 11:29:57 AM] Steve: Still shouldn't assume that
[8/7/17, 11:30:00 AM] Steve: You have no idea
[8/7/17, 11:30:16 AM] Steve: Could have been an accident
[8/7/17, 11:30:22 AM] Steve: Could have been cancer
[8/7/17, 11:30:26 AM] Steve: Who the fuck knows
[8/7/17, 11:30:35 AM] Launchpad: ^^^ facebook post did not mention any accident or cancer
[8/7/17, 11:30:44 AM] Steve: It didn't mention suicide either
[8/7/17, 11:30:47 AM] Launchpad: and it could of been, but thats my guess
[8/7/17, 11:30:50 AM] Steve: So what's your point?
[8/7/17, 11:31:01 AM] Launchpad: whats your point?
[8/7/17, 11:31:04 AM] Launchpad: Im speculating
[8/7/17, 11:31:07 AM] Steve: Since it didn't mention anything you assume suicide?
[8/7/17, 11:31:15 AM] Launchpad: I've seen the things hes posted on FB before
[8/7/17, 11:31:49 AM] Miller: probably not cancer considering how surprised she sounds about it, but yea could have gotten hit by a car, who the fuck knows
[8/7/17, 11:31:50 AM] Launchpad: including a few months ago -- his best friend, and phil & deezy's other mountain view roommate also passed away
[8/7/17, 11:32:14 AM] Donk: yeah, while its probably best not to speculate, given his previous posts, its likely drug related in some way
[8/7/17, 11:32:30 AM] Launchpad: suidice or OD seems most likely
[8/7/17, 11:39:35 AM] Launchpad: in other news
[8/7/17, 11:40:07 AM] Launchpad: I'm going back to Camp No Counselors this week in Denver.  Hopefully around this time a week from now I'll have some awesome stories
[8/7/17, 11:40:31 AM] Launchpad: you guys should sign up for an NY camp

[8/7/17, 4:38:39 PM] Steve: Says the guy who watches all of the housewives
[8/7/17, 4:39:05 PM] Steve: Posts the guy who believes white privilege doesn't exist
[8/7/17, 4:39:15 PM] Steve: Lol at both of you
[8/7/17, 4:40:26 PM] Launchpad: 1) I never said privilege doesn't exist
2) what does that have to do with celebrity divorces?
[8/7/17, 4:40:50 PM] Brian Katz: Chi-raq is no joke
[8/7/17, 4:41:32 PM] Steve: BecAuse you are saying those people are the worst
[8/7/17, 4:41:46 PM] Steve: I would say people who think white privilege doesn't exist are much worse
[8/7/17, 4:41:54 PM] Miller: i enjoy watching housewives, doesnt mean i personally care what happens in any of their personal lives to the point of actually being upset about it
[8/7/17, 4:41:55 PM] Steve: As well as people who watch garbage housewives
[8/7/17, 4:42:13 PM] Steve: The fact that you spend time out of your life watching that is enough personal investment
[8/7/17, 4:42:24 PM] Miller: what shows do you like?
[8/7/17, 4:42:36 PM] Steve: Many
[8/7/17, 4:42:43 PM] Steve: But I'm the one criticizing others here
[8/7/17, 4:42:44 PM] Miller: just name one
[8/7/17, 4:42:49 PM] Steve: So don't flip it on me
[8/7/17, 4:43:04 PM] Steve: You are the one that agrees with a statement of "those people are he worst"
[8/7/17, 4:43:05 PM] Miller: also you used to watch duck dynasty lol so be careful about throwing stones
[8/7/17, 4:43:15 PM] Steve: Now you are trying to make yourself feel better about it
[8/7/17, 4:43:19 PM] Brian Katz: Steve definitely loves king of Queens lol
[8/7/17, 4:43:28 PM] Miller: more like king of long island tbh
[8/7/17, 4:43:30 PM] Steve: I'm not throwing stones
[8/7/17, 4:43:38 PM] Steve: That's actually the opposite of what I'm doing
[8/7/17, 4:43:40 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/7/17, 4:43:44 PM] Launchpad: No I'm just tired of a bunch of crybaby bloggers blaming their low income and poor life decisions on me and using racist arguments to do so in order to make me feel guilty
[8/7/17, 4:43:44 PM] Steve: You and LP actually are
[8/7/17, 4:43:46 PM] Miller: like katz likes GoT
[8/7/17, 4:43:58 PM] Miller: does it mean katz cares what happens in emilia clarkes personal life?
[8/7/17, 4:43:59 PM] Steve: Right
[8/7/17, 4:44:03 PM] Steve: That's it L
[8/7/17, 4:44:06 PM] Steve: LP
[8/7/17, 4:44:14 PM] Steve: Glad you learn nothing on the daily
[8/7/17, 4:44:17 PM] Miller: i think its ridiculous when ppl get emotionally invested in celebrity couples yes
[8/7/17, 4:44:19 PM] Steve: But keep reading things
[8/7/17, 4:44:27 PM] Miller: they dont give a fuck about "you"
[8/7/17, 4:44:30 PM] Brian Katz: As long as she finishes up the series I don't care what she does
[8/7/17, 4:44:33 PM] Scott: steve are you angry, or is this an LOL moment?
[8/7/17, 4:44:39 PM] Steve: And they probably think it's rediculous you watchbhours and hours of awful TV
[8/7/17, 4:44:46 PM] Steve: It's def an lol moment
[8/7/17, 4:44:46 PM] Launchpad: I went to college, took out student loans and have been repaying them off with the money I make in the career I chose
[8/7/17, 4:44:51 PM] Miller: thats great, they are entitled to think that
[8/7/17, 4:45:04 PM] Miller: when someone posts an article about that in their group chat they can say agreed
[8/7/17, 4:45:05 PM] Miller: im fine w/that
[8/7/17, 4:45:27 PM] Miller: i didnt say they arent allowed to have opinions, i said i personally think its absurd how many people care about these peoples personal lives
[8/7/17, 4:46:11 PM] Steve: Again LP, you have learned nothing from the countless arguments/discussions
[8/7/17, 4:46:14 PM] Steve: Zero
[8/7/17, 4:46:26 PM] Launchpad: My grandfather was a slave, cry me a river
[8/7/17, 4:46:27 PM] Steve: Keep reading though
[8/7/17, 4:46:48 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/7/17, 4:46:50 PM] Steve: Ok
[8/7/17, 4:47:43 PM] Launchpad: yes, he was a slave for several years in that thing ....what was it called again?
[8/7/17, 4:47:48 PM] Launchpad: Holocaust!!
[8/7/17, 4:47:58 PM] Launchpad: yes thats it, he was a slave in the Holocaust
[8/7/17, 4:49:32 PM] Donk: im not getting involved in the main part of this arguement
[8/7/17, 4:49:38 PM] Donk: but stop comparing the holocaust to slavery
[8/7/17, 4:49:42 PM] Steve: Your obtuse way of being reminds me why I don't want to go anywhere near another draft trip.
[8/7/17, 4:49:46 PM] Donk: it is not an equal comparison
[8/7/17, 4:50:10 PM] Launchpad: funny cause we didn't do any of this bullshit on our trip
[8/7/17, 6:06:50 PM] Sean: What's wrong with house wives?!
[8/7/17, 6:06:53 PM] Sean: That shit is amazing
[8/7/17, 6:45:16 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/7/17, 6:46:15 PM] Miller: Probably for the best we both went home
[8/7/17, 6:46:45 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah bro, she nicely saying that she's glad she didn't sleep with you.
[8/7/17, 6:47:25 PM] Launchpad: cause she wants to be sober and remember it
[8/7/17, 6:47:39 PM] Launchpad: otherwise there is no reason at all this girl would still be talking to me
[8/7/17, 6:47:49 PM] Scott: So she can remember it and mock it with her friends.
[8/7/17, 6:48:55 PM] Brian Katz: Idk sounds fishy to me
[8/7/17, 9:25:49 PM] Launchpad: so we're hanging out Wednesday
[8/7/17, 9:25:58 PM] Launchpad: Its redemption time boys
[8/7/17, 9:44:24 PM] Brian Katz: Good luck
[8/7/17, 9:48:05 PM] Justin: I hope the comment to her you made wasnt actually what happened...... thats a step into implication territory
[8/7/17, 9:52:21 PM] Justin: not saying its rape, not saying other people don't do the same thing, and not saying she isnt beyond responsible and stupid at that moment....but I am saying that if a girl is so blacked out she says "lets get out of here" and you essentially throw her into a cab without telling her where she is going, as you indicated in that text, and in a moment of clarity she jumps out of said car in presumed fear of being raped, alcohol defnitely caused some lines to be crossed . All worked out in the end i suppose
[8/7/17, 9:53:02 PM] Launchpad: yeah lol I get it -- a little sketchy
[8/7/17, 9:53:03 PM] Justin: unless shes 16 and chris hansen show sup at date
[8/7/17, 9:53:09 PM] Launchpad: not my ideal seduction...
[8/7/17, 9:53:22 PM] Launchpad: but we were making out, which she initiated
[8/7/17, 9:53:34 PM] Launchpad: she implicated herself!
[8/7/17, 9:54:13 PM] Justin: listen according to betsy devos many men have been taken down in similar situations
[8/7/17, 9:54:25 PM] Justin: they have lose their jobs and education
[8/7/17, 9:56:21 PM] Justin: maybe a wird question...why do you have her number?
[8/7/17, 9:56:28 PM] Justin: also how does she remember getting your number?
[8/7/17, 9:56:48 PM] Launchpad: she gave it to me
[8/7/17, 9:56:54 PM] Launchpad: we were hanging out for a while
[8/7/17, 9:57:14 PM] Justin: just seems like an exit move
[8/7/17, 9:57:28 PM] Justin: mid conversation phone exchange
[8/8/17, 6:36:32 AM] Brian Katz: Hgh?
[8/8/17, 6:54:50 AM] Miller: 13 years old, 5 7 177

[8/8/17, 7:20:53 AM] Miller: if anyone watched the video w/o sound, you should listen to it the audio is great
[8/8/17, 8:49:43 AM] Steve: Is it just me or does the recommendations app on Facebook just make people become lazier?
[8/8/17, 8:50:29 AM] Steve: Facebooks like: Why google? Recommend someone else to do it for you!
[8/8/17, 8:52:28 AM] Miller: idk what the reccomendations app is
[8/8/17, 8:52:33 AM] Miller: i thought you meant the people you might know thing
[8/8/17, 8:53:13 AM] Sean: Yeah but I trust my friends opinions of places more then google.
[8/8/17, 8:53:27 AM] Sean: Wouldn't you rather have a reliable source?
[8/8/17, 9:13:20 AM] Donk: yeah i dont see the problem with this
[8/8/17, 9:13:22 AM] Miller: i dont think its being lazy, same reason we asked ppl for reccomendations before we went to NO/MTL/Austin
[8/8/17, 9:13:26 AM] Donk: asking your friends for recommendations makes sense imo
[8/8/17, 9:14:20 AM] Donk: better to ask your friends than to just trust yelp/travel advisor reviews from strangers
[8/8/17, 9:14:46 AM] Miller: depends which friend but in theory
[8/8/17, 9:16:28 AM] Sean: Right I'm saying I may see a popular place that you have been to and know I'll hate it
[8/8/17, 9:16:57 AM] Brian Katz: Shouldn't be united we kneel?
[8/8/17, 9:17:01 AM] Miller: also is tia quoting jay?
[8/8/17, 9:17:10 AM] Miller: no they spelled his name wrong lol
[8/8/17, 9:17:55 AM] Brian Katz: Well he's not good enough for people to spell his name right.
[8/8/17, 9:18:39 AM] Launchpad: Lol i thought the 'we stand' part was quite ironic
[8/8/17, 9:18:40 AM] Miller: although lots of ppl on twitter are making the stand/kneel joke katz
[8/8/17, 12:12:51 PM] Miller: He really is
[8/8/17, 12:13:27 PM] Scott: if all of us were chiefs maybe we wouldnt have been shut down  ü§î
[8/8/17, 12:13:43 PM] Miller: Or if you never became president
[8/8/17, 12:13:46 PM] Miller: Either way
[8/8/17, 12:23:54 PM] Scott: wow
[8/8/17, 12:30:45 PM] Steve: I partially blame wild fans presidency also
[8/8/17, 12:30:50 PM] Steve: *dans

[8/8/17, 1:50:56 PM] Launchpad: im reading it right now
[8/8/17, 4:09:59 PM] Miller: @16313981203 you're the closest, can you do something about this kim jong situation before we end up in nuclear war? Ty
[8/8/17, 6:29:28 PM] Kiyoon: Sure I'll stop by on the way home
[8/8/17, 7:36:15 PM] Tk: Don't worry Mills. Mr. Art of the Deal will fix it all. One of his many victories that we will grow tired of.
[8/8/17, 8:06:22 PM] Justin: guess trump is about to answer the can you staet world war III on vacation
[8/8/17, 8:06:40 PM] Justin: "can you start ww III while on vacation?"

[8/8/17, 10:46:32 PM] Miller: What a joke
[8/8/17, 10:48:07 PM] Justin: well I mean, HRC did say RUssia was biggest threat to america, doesnt make that part untrue
[8/8/17, 10:49:04 PM] Dan Watts: @15165329107
[8/9/17, 9:55:21 AM] Launchpad: Oh shit....got Qdoba taco bar at lunch today
[8/9/17, 9:55:50 AM] Launchpad: wasn't someone just saying they should bring it back?
[8/9/17, 9:56:33 AM] Launchpad: there it is
[8/9/17, 9:56:54 AM] Miller: thats the best, we used to get it pretty frequently
[8/9/17, 9:57:01 AM] Miller: never ate dinner those nights
[8/9/17, 9:58:53 AM] Launchpad: weird....I never knew we had any around here except the one they put in the airport a few years ago
[8/9/17, 9:59:27 AM] Launchpad: apparently there is one more restaurant and their global headquarters
[8/9/17, 9:59:59 AM] Launchpad: Qdoba Mexican Eats, the quick-stop casual burrito shop that started in Denver 21 years ago, is moving its headquarters to San Diego from Lakewood to consolidate with its parent company, Jack in the Box.
[8/9/17, 10:00:16 AM] Scott: so it'll be qdoba in the box?
[8/9/17, 10:00:19 AM] Scott: lol
[8/9/17, 10:00:39 AM] Launchpad: Q in the Box
[8/9/17, 10:01:33 AM] Launchpad: Im glad I'm eating Q today so I don't have to eat it all weekend in Denver

[8/9/17, 11:18:25 AM] Justin: Funny I thought about that irony yesterday. All those crazy fucken idiots who believe in NWO and voted for trump, may have in fact brought about the NWO.
[8/9/17, 11:19:38 AM] Brian Katz: I've been down since 1996

[8/9/17, 1:15:48 PM] Miller: You could always not go
[8/9/17, 1:16:08 PM] Miller: If enough people don't go they will not remain in business

[8/9/17, 2:31:58 PM] Launchpad: Good summary -- I had no idea who this was other than the fact Watts hates her
[8/9/17, 2:35:48 PM] Dan Watts: Linda Sarsour is THE WORST
[8/9/17, 2:35:55 PM] Dan Watts: Way worse than king
[8/9/17, 2:36:32 PM] Dan Watts: There was a recent piece in huffpost about her lunacy. If they're separating themselves from her you know she bad
[8/9/17, 2:37:39 PM] Launchpad: lol
[8/9/17, 2:40:38 PM] Justin: So what are her lunatic stances?
[8/9/17, 2:43:11 PM] Justin: Also is ironic that watts stance is literally what that article is about.
[8/9/17, 2:44:29 PM] Justin: Guess not ironic, highly coincidental
[8/9/17, 2:44:35 PM] Launchpad: Herman I'm surprised you haven't weighed in on the Google memo
[8/9/17, 2:44:58 PM] Justin: Busy deadlifting. Timing worked out well on this one
[8/9/17, 2:45:05 PM] Dan Watts: She tweeted @ ayan hirsi ali that her vagina should be ripped from her etc etc etc
[8/9/17, 2:45:14 PM] Dan Watts: Recently called for a jihad on the trump admin
[8/9/17, 2:45:19 PM] Dan Watts: Nbd
[8/9/17, 2:45:28 PM] Justin: Really that's a big deal?
[8/9/17, 2:45:47 PM] Justin: She told a women she has no eighth to be a women. Omg the controversy
[8/9/17, 2:46:06 PM] Justin: She called trump asdministration. For what it is, omg the controversy
[8/9/17, 2:46:13 PM] Justin: Please keep going though.
[8/9/17, 2:46:17 PM] Dan Watts: Ok if you don't think that's a big deal than fine
[8/9/17, 2:46:31 PM] Dan Watts: No on takes her seriously but you
[8/9/17, 2:46:38 PM] Justin: I mean vulgar words are a big deal now?
[8/9/17, 2:46:55 PM] Justin: If she said fuck trump, that would mean she is  lunatic?
[8/9/17, 2:47:18 PM] Justin: I thought you disliked pic culture
[8/9/17, 2:47:21 PM] Justin: Pc*
[8/9/17, 2:47:28 PM] Dan Watts: A jihad?
[8/9/17, 2:47:33 PM] Dan Watts: That's normal?
[8/9/17, 2:47:51 PM] Justin: YOu seem stuck on that word
[8/9/17, 2:47:58 PM] Dan Watts: Herman you have so lost any ability to be remotely objective and moderate
[8/9/17, 2:48:03 PM] Justin: As if she declared war on trump it would be different
[8/9/17, 2:48:20 PM] Justin: I think you are fitting or definition of pc to align with your values
[8/9/17, 2:48:26 PM] Dan Watts: Yes I am stuck on that word
[8/9/17, 2:48:51 PM] Dan Watts: There's been 30000 attacks since 911 around the world in the name of jihad where innocent people were killed
[8/9/17, 2:48:54 PM] Justin: I'm not the one arguing that the word jihad Carries some meaning of death  behind it in American culture
[8/9/17, 2:48:57 PM] Dan Watts: NBD tho
[8/9/17, 2:49:07 PM] Justin: How many victims of jihad have there been in America?
[8/9/17, 2:49:19 PM] Dan Watts: Who fucking cares
[8/9/17, 2:49:26 PM] Justin: And millions due to American foreign policy
[8/9/17, 2:49:33 PM] Dan Watts: There's people who's parents in this chat have died due to jihad
[8/9/17, 2:49:36 PM] Justin: In fact this year alone directly probably above 30k
[8/9/17, 2:49:47 PM] Justin: Are you gonna stand up to the word "war"
[8/9/17, 2:50:02 PM] Dan Watts: I'm not having this discussion with you
[8/9/17, 2:50:04 PM] Justin: And by probably I mean likely in every single nation we are in conflict with
[8/9/17, 2:50:04 PM] Dan Watts: Your so warped
[8/9/17, 2:50:11 PM] Dan Watts: Ok
[8/9/17, 2:50:15 PM] Justin: Think what you want, in being consistent
[8/9/17, 2:50:29 PM] Dan Watts: It's not consistent at all
[8/9/17, 2:50:30 PM] Justin: You think she is some sort of Muslim sleeper cell
[8/9/17, 2:50:34 PM] Justin: I mean it's comical
[8/9/17, 2:50:37 PM] Dan Watts: I don't think that
[8/9/17, 2:50:41 PM] Dan Watts: I think she's a moron
[8/9/17, 2:51:02 PM] Dan Watts: And the fact you defend her is scary
[8/9/17, 2:51:07 PM] Justin: So she used word jihad therefore she is a moron
[8/9/17, 2:51:07 PM] Launchpad: jihad a trigger word
[8/9/17, 2:51:19 PM] Dan Watts: Yes
[8/9/17, 2:51:23 PM] Justin: Ok
[8/9/17, 2:51:41 PM] Dan Watts: Her reputation is totally tarnished
[8/9/17, 2:51:55 PM] Dan Watts: The only people defending her are far left apologists and you
[8/9/17, 2:52:03 PM] Justin: Yeh I get it. She used word jihad which allowed you to find some crazy justification for why you already don't like her
[8/9/17, 2:52:13 PM] Justin: Strong case u have made
[8/9/17, 2:52:50 PM] Justin: Might want to look into her meanin. For the word jihad fwiw
[8/9/17, 2:53:32 PM] Justin: But hey That would just further diminish the rediculous claim that somehow she is calling for radical terrorism in America
[8/9/17, 2:53:43 PM] Justin: And she wants to rip out women's vaginas
[8/9/17, 2:53:55 PM] Justin: I know I'm warped.
[8/9/17, 2:54:07 PM] Dan Watts: You sound like Ben affleck when he was crushed by Sam Harris and maher. Keep apologizing for this type of behavior. It's cool really
[8/9/17, 2:54:24 PM] Dan Watts: These types of opinions are why the left is losing and will continue to lose
[8/9/17, 2:55:17 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/9/17, 2:56:08 PM] Justin: No voting for tax cuts for the wealthy exporting jobs overseas and allowing Donald trump to promise to make America great are why the left loses.
[8/9/17, 2:56:39 PM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[8/9/17, 2:56:48 PM] Steve: @17189742074 are you on the right?
[8/9/17, 2:56:51 PM] Justin: I know this because I turned to Fox News for 3 minutes yesterday and that's all steve miller was talking about
[8/9/17, 2:56:57 PM] Steve: Just asking
[8/9/17, 2:57:06 PM] Steve: Not really trying to get involved in this convo at all
[8/9/17, 2:57:13 PM] Justin: I heard it, I felt the message. I'm sure that's what people who watch here also.
[8/9/17, 2:57:31 PM] Justin: But keep blaming it on a Muslim women talking about being oppressed and using trigger words
[8/9/17, 2:57:41 PM] Justin: Omg she said jihad.
[8/9/17, 2:58:01 PM] Justin: Would love to see when she said jihad. I'd assume it was well after ou already hated her.
[8/9/17, 2:58:37 PM] Justin: So let's rewind back. Without this new evidence you used to fit into your preconceived notion, before jihad, why was she a lunatic?
[8/9/17, 2:59:11 PM] Justin: FYI article miller sent literally used the two examples you gave- no coincidence there
[8/9/17, 3:06:37 PM] Justin: Clearly I'm  on the progressive side of things. If a libertarian wants to make a economic argument in favor of market economics and provides actual data, we could agree to disagree and there is no real way to prove right or wrong. But don't come at me with this pseudo PC bullshit, about how someone's language offends you, when you in fact get offended by that argument when it comes to things like safe spaces and cultural appropriation. That isn't logically consistent.
[8/9/17, 3:08:21 PM] Dan Watts: Herman when we speak in real life about this stuff you're very reasonable. Idk why you use this platform to start getting tough on this stuff. I think you also think that the more you type the more right you are. Currently I'm driving on the bqe. If you want to have a reasoned in person debate on this we can but I'm not doing this with you anymore
[8/9/17, 3:08:37 PM] Justin: Fair.
[8/9/17, 3:08:51 PM] Miller: trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
[8/9/17, 3:08:57 PM] Justin: I think I'm reasoned in both cases, just comes off less aggressive in real life
[8/9/17, 3:09:36 PM] Steve: Yea, you all take texts much more seriously than if it was said in person
[8/9/17, 3:09:42 PM] Justin: But fair enough. Well leave it to in person.
[8/9/17, 3:09:56 PM] Steve: I also notice I am the same IRL that I am on here and everyone says I'm an angry man
[8/9/17, 3:10:05 PM] Steve: I'm only 1/4 angry
[8/9/17, 3:10:12 PM] Steve: 1/2 trolling
[8/9/17, 3:10:21 PM] Steve: And a 1/4 chilling
[8/9/17, 3:11:55 PM] Steve: Also, @17189742074 are you a conservative or not? Don't be avoiding the question just because you are on the BQE
[8/9/17, 3:12:26 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/9/17, 3:13:00 PM] Brian Katz: What's that?
[8/9/17, 3:13:10 PM] Brian Katz: Guac and

[8/9/17, 3:14:32 PM] Miller: wheres the chips?
[8/9/17, 3:14:36 PM] Miller: wheres the steak?
[8/9/17, 3:14:39 PM] Miller: wheres the tortilla?
[8/9/17, 3:14:42 PM] Miller: youre doing qdoba all wrong
[8/9/17, 3:14:56 PM] Scott: Loser.
[8/9/17, 3:16:18 PM] Launchpad: the queso is there, but I added another layer after I took this pic
[8/9/17, 3:16:24 PM] Launchpad: and more steak
[8/9/17, 3:16:42 PM] Launchpad: no tortillas or chips
[8/9/17, 3:17:05 PM] Launchpad: gotta be Camp ready üí™
[8/9/17, 3:17:39 PM] Launchpad: steak, chicken, black beans, pinto beans, queso, guac, salsa
[8/9/17, 3:17:45 PM] Launchpad: and some filler lettuce
[8/9/17, 3:18:20 PM] Brian Katz: You back on the slow carb diet til then?
[8/9/17, 3:20:34 PM] Launchpad: Si
[8/9/17, 3:20:48 PM] Launchpad: althought Miller just talked me into trying chips & queso
[8/9/17, 3:21:13 PM] Launchpad: got back on it after Austin / July 4
[8/9/17, 3:21:24 PM] Miller: now you have a scapegoat if you dont hook up w/anyone in camp
[8/9/17, 3:21:31 PM] Launchpad: queso
[8/9/17, 3:21:36 PM] Launchpad: nah its goin down
[8/9/17, 3:21:39 PM] Launchpad: Im back
[8/9/17, 3:21:48 PM] Launchpad: and got momentum pushing me forward
[8/9/17, 3:21:54 PM] Launchpad: Im going to bang the Uber jumper tonight
[8/9/17, 3:23:36 PM] Scott: Uber jumper?
[8/9/17, 3:23:40 PM] Launchpad: we got an ice cream sunday bar here today too, but Im just gonna have a 2nd bowl instead
[8/9/17, 3:23:58 PM] Launchpad: the girl who jumped out of my Uber on the way back to my place on friday
[8/9/17, 3:23:59 PM] Brian Katz: She leaped out of an uber to avoid Scotty's implications
[8/9/17, 3:24:14 PM] Launchpad: and now she wants to reimplicate
[8/9/17, 3:27:48 PM] Brian Katz: What is that from?
[8/9/17, 3:28:36 PM] Miller: idk, looks like it could be HIMYM
[8/9/17, 3:29:09 PM] Brian Katz: Maybe
[8/9/17, 3:33:52 PM] Justin: Crazy stupid love?
[8/9/17, 3:34:15 PM] Justin: Looks like steve Carrell and Juliane Moore
[8/9/17, 3:34:31 PM] Donk: i think its crazy stupid love
[8/9/17, 3:34:43 PM] Justin: Only movie I can think of with them is that with Emma stone and Ryan Phillipe
[8/9/17, 3:34:59 PM] Donk: unless thats catherine keener, in which case its 40 year old virgin, but i dont think it is
[8/9/17, 3:35:13 PM] Justin: Yeh that's option 2
[8/9/17, 3:35:30 PM] Launchpad: wasnt she wigging out?
[8/9/17, 3:36:06 PM] Justin: That's eliz banks
[8/9/17, 3:36:11 PM] Justin: Different scene
[8/9/17, 3:36:13 PM] Miller: no judd apatows wife was the one drunk in the car going nuts
[8/9/17, 3:36:28 PM] Justin: Maybe miller right
[8/9/17, 3:36:33 PM] Miller: o i am
[8/9/17, 3:36:43 PM] Justin: Wife in big daddy etc
[8/9/17, 3:36:43 PM] Donk: miller is to blame here for the shitty quality of this gif
[8/9/17, 3:36:54 PM] Donk: hd gifs only please
[8/9/17, 3:37:13 PM] Launchpad: did you send that gif from your Nokia?
[8/9/17, 3:37:32 PM] Miller: whatsapp web
[8/9/17, 3:37:40 PM] Miller: unfortunately has shitty gif support
[8/9/17, 3:38:11 PM] Miller: leslie mann, thats her name

[8/9/17, 4:13:37 PM] Launchpad: "On the positive side, people in the review who cut out high fructose corn syrup became healthier without dieting or counting calories"
[8/9/17, 4:19:26 PM] Justin: being that you had to go there, where does it say "eating high fructose corn syrup is bad for you, but ok once a week"
[8/9/17, 4:20:37 PM] Launchpad: wasn't part of the study

[8/9/17, 4:28:00 PM] Justin: interesting you posted that
[8/9/17, 4:28:09 PM] Justin: yeh fasting has some science behind it
[8/9/17, 4:28:25 PM] Justin: not sure how storng it is, but they are seeing correlations
[8/9/17, 4:29:13 PM] Justin: guy used jacked lol
[8/9/17, 4:29:16 PM] Justin: shit was crack
[8/9/17, 4:44:16 PM] Launchpad: Speaking of cheat days I think @16318489683 needs one.  He's posted like 15 food videos today on Facebook
[8/9/17, 4:44:55 PM] Brian Katz: I've gone cheat day less last week
[8/9/17, 4:45:28 PM] Launchpad: You no longer need a day, just a couple of videos
[8/9/17, 4:45:36 PM] Brian Katz: Lol yup
[8/9/17, 4:45:50 PM] Brian Katz: Nah I'm seeing if I can go til the 26th
[8/9/17, 5:59:30 PM] Justin: think you will notice that if you can go 6 days and enjoy it without eating shitty...you cna likely go 7
[8/9/17, 6:02:47 PM] Launchpad: sure you can
[8/9/17, 6:04:11 PM] Launchpad: The thing you conveniently like to forget about Tim Ferris, the self proclaimed 'human guinea pig' - is that self experimentation is part of the process.  He is not proclaiming the world of the Lord onto the peons
[8/9/17, 6:04:19 PM] Launchpad: You don't like cheat day?? Dont do it
[8/9/17, 6:04:25 PM] Launchpad: You need cheat day? Do it
[8/9/17, 6:04:39 PM] Launchpad: observe and take notes, and keep what works for you
[8/9/17, 6:04:50 PM] Launchpad: you your cheat day hate is unwarranted
[8/9/17, 6:05:11 PM] Justin: im just stating a reality
[8/9/17, 6:05:41 PM] Justin: also there is a differnece between saying do it or dont do it.... and  doing it helps keep body out of starvation mdoe.
[8/9/17, 6:05:45 PM] Justin: just saying
[8/9/17, 6:06:37 PM] Launchpad: Heres a reality -- the 4 Hour Body works, no matter how much you dislike it
[8/9/17, 6:06:48 PM] Justin: you are the worst
[8/9/17, 6:06:52 PM] Justin: all i said was i think hell be fine
[8/9/17, 6:07:01 PM] Justin: you took it as im attackign cheat days and attacking tim ferris
[8/9/17, 6:07:16 PM] Justin: you then set up a strawman as to what cheat days are by yyour own defintion
[8/9/17, 6:07:21 PM] Justin: thus creating this argu,ment

[8/10/17, 7:40:58 AM] Brian Katz: I saw that on Facebook, next level
[8/10/17, 7:42:08 AM] Miller: is it though? its just fried chicken, sauce, and cheese, its literally just a normal chicken parm
[8/10/17, 7:44:20 AM] Brian Katz: Next level
[8/10/17, 7:51:41 AM] Steve: Yea it's just a chicken parm in pizza form
[8/10/17, 7:51:50 AM] Steve: Delicious, but still just that
[8/10/17, 8:10:11 AM] Scott: Every potato is a French fry.
[8/10/17, 8:10:15 AM] Scott: Here we go again
[8/10/17, 8:11:09 AM] Steve: I've never said that statement, ever.
[8/10/17, 8:11:28 AM] Steve: I'd like you to not put words in my mouth
[8/10/17, 8:11:32 AM] Steve: Have some integrity
[8/10/17, 8:14:04 AM] Scott: Think u sis
[8/10/17, 8:14:05 AM] Scott: Did
[8/10/17, 8:14:20 AM] Scott: What did u say then?
[8/10/17, 8:15:13 AM] Steve: Nope
[8/10/17, 8:15:22 AM] Steve: I just said tater tots are fries
[8/10/17, 8:15:31 AM] Steve: You put words in my mouth
[8/10/17, 8:15:36 AM] Steve: As per usual
[8/10/17, 8:15:40 AM] Steve: And your cheesy self
[8/10/17, 8:15:59 AM] Brian Katz: Tater  tots are tater tots, fries are fries
[8/10/17, 8:16:09 AM] Steve: We'll agree to disagree
[8/10/17, 8:16:18 AM] Steve: Like on many, many other things
[8/10/17, 8:16:20 AM] Brian Katz: They're all fried potatoes
[8/10/17, 8:17:58 AM] Scott: Thank u
[8/10/17, 8:18:12 AM] Scott: Tots are tots, fries are fries
[8/10/17, 8:18:37 AM] Steve: We'll agree to disagree
[8/10/17, 8:19:03 AM] Scott: No we will just disagree.
[8/10/17, 8:19:09 AM] Scott: I won't agree to disagreeing.
[8/10/17, 8:19:40 AM] Brian Katz: I personally enjoy the toy over the fry
[8/10/17, 8:19:49 AM] Brian Katz: Tot*
[8/10/17, 9:46:58 AM] Brian Katz: That made my day lol
[8/10/17, 9:47:22 AM] Donk: weird egg shaped tater tots
[8/10/17, 9:51:07 AM] Launchpad: I discovered that one yesterday while doing a gif search on 'vagina'
[8/10/17, 10:14:26 AM] Miller: finished season 2 of last chance u, 5/7, highly recommended for anyone who likes football or documentaries

[8/10/17, 11:01:28 AM] Steve: Damn it, wrong fucking meme
[8/10/17, 11:43:54 AM] Justin: https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/we-sent-alex-jones-infowars-supplements-to-a-lab-heres?utm_term=.vsrG1barm&bffbnews#.bt7yPNA6q
[8/10/17, 11:45:49 AM] Justin: Buzzfeed coming at him now as well. Funny thing is the article is like he's selling useless supplements and making millions of dollars--im legitimately trying to figure out what he's doing more wrong/different than any other supplement company.
[8/10/17, 11:46:28 AM] Launchpad: true right?
[8/10/17, 11:46:44 AM] Miller: most supplements are peddled by supplement companies and not conspiracy theories?
[8/10/17, 11:46:54 AM] Justin: Yeh it's a hit piece- but kinda silly
[8/10/17, 11:47:19 AM] Justin: Idk. I mean if his fans are dumb enough to buy it, that's on them.
[8/10/17, 11:47:30 AM] Miller: like theres a difference b/w some company telling joe shmo to buy this so he can get jacked and some guy telling you if you dont buy this the fluoride int he water is going to turn you gay
[8/10/17, 11:47:33 AM] Miller: no doubt
[8/10/17, 11:47:37 AM] Miller: but i do think there is a difference
[8/10/17, 11:47:55 AM] Miller: hes integrating it into his "news"
[8/10/17, 11:49:11 AM] Justin: Yeh I mean there is a difference. But it's not like sports radio doesn't do the exact same thing.
[8/10/17, 11:49:30 AM] Justin: Also if he sold advertisements to supplement companies, he would just be making someone else rich
[8/10/17, 11:54:28 AM] Justin: If anyone been on fence about getting an Xbox elite controller. https://slickdeals.net/f/10441712-xbox-one-elite-controller-70-after-student-code-and-trade-in-ymmv?v=1
[8/10/17, 11:54:59 AM] Justin: Cheapest it usually goes is 105.
[8/10/17, 1:09:33 PM] Miller: idk if anyone has heard of this, my coworker just sent it to me, https://earny.app.link/bDcGY0T9uF apparently this company goes and checks if anything you buy has a lower price after you buy it and automatically gets you an adjustment (and keeps 5%), only works w/Chase or Citi cards so doesnt work for me, but he had a bunch of checks so its legit
[8/10/17, 1:10:06 PM] Brian Katz: Does anyone know if you can order ppvs off of the Amazon fire stick?
[8/10/17, 2:30:47 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/10/17, 2:31:34 PM] Miller: 2 suitcases for a weekend? jfc
[8/10/17, 2:31:35 PM] Miller: also
[8/10/17, 2:31:59 PM] Miller: what are thooooooooooooose?!
[8/10/17, 2:32:13 PM] Steve: I have only one and I'm going for two weeks to Spain
[8/10/17, 2:32:29 PM] Launchpad: Bedding, pillow, costumes
[8/10/17, 2:32:52 PM] Launchpad: Takes up space.  Annoying but whatever
[8/10/17, 2:33:32 PM] Launchpad: Indoor and outdoor towel
[8/10/17, 2:33:44 PM] Miller: did you pack a bed as well?
[8/10/17, 2:33:46 PM] Miller: and some walls?
[8/10/17, 2:33:48 PM] Miller: and a shower?
[8/10/17, 2:34:41 PM] Launchpad: Small bag is for normal trip shit.  Big bag is those listed above
[8/10/17, 2:36:49 PM] Launchpad: I'm not happy about it I had to pay $40 to add the extra carry on
[8/10/17, 2:37:29 PM] Launchpad: Bag check in line at fronteir is painfully slow
[8/10/17, 2:40:18 PM] Brian Katz: You going to camp?
[8/10/17, 2:40:44 PM] Launchpad: Yeah son
[8/10/17, 2:41:52 PM] Launchpad: This is what we put the hours in the gym and kitchen for. Its survival of the fittest out here üí™
[8/10/17, 2:43:18 PM] Justin: hit any pr's on gym journey?
[8/10/17, 2:43:19 PM] Donk: survival of the fittest.....while you sleep in a bed, in a cabin, and have all of your food prepared for you
[8/10/17, 2:45:28 PM] Justin: got one for you before you jump on the plane

[8/10/17, 2:46:37 PM] Justin: women coders perform better when the gender of coder is unknown...slightly worse than man when known
[8/10/17, 2:48:00 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty would you rather have a women pilot or a male pilot on your way to Denver?
[8/10/17, 2:49:00 PM] Brian Katz: Also women fall into stereotypes.  They've heard these things since they were young, so they must be true.
[8/10/17, 2:50:03 PM] Miller: *bed/cabin/food have to brought by you
[8/10/17, 3:14:39 PM] Launchpad: I meant survival in reference to my competition for chicks and other games. Not fucking survivor
[8/10/17, 3:15:56 PM] Launchpad: Male pilot, but only because I want all my pilots to grey haired, grandfatherly and Capt Sullenburger like
[8/10/17, 3:17:25 PM] Launchpad: Women coders are just as capable as men.  They just aren't as interested in the field and dont enter it in the same numbers that men do
[8/10/17, 3:20:19 PM] Launchpad: No but rebuilding muscle I lost earlier this year.  Haven't been doing the big barbell lifts,  mostly machines

[8/10/17, 3:36:26 PM] Steve: You realize the daily wire is a subset of breitbart right?
[8/10/17, 3:36:48 PM] Steve: Steve bannon jr created it
[8/10/17, 3:38:44 PM] Miller: why is upset in quotes? does nobody on the right know how to use quotes properly?
[8/10/17, 3:38:59 PM] Steve: 'Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew' - maybe you'll recognize this headline
[8/10/17, 3:39:46 PM] Steve: And by Steve bannon jr I mean Shapiro
[8/10/17, 3:39:51 PM] Launchpad: Irony is irony
[8/10/17, 3:39:55 PM] Steve: Who is essentially him in his 30's
[8/10/17, 3:40:07 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/10/17, 3:40:28 PM] Miller: this is like a bad version of the onion
[8/10/17, 3:43:31 PM] Steve: So you think irony entails posting an article about an organization that clearly thinks women are less than men?
[8/10/17, 3:45:20 PM] Launchpad: This statement is absolutely ridiculous
[8/10/17, 3:45:54 PM] Steve: Do you normally read daily wire/breitbart?
[8/10/17, 3:46:10 PM] Steve: Here are a couple of articles and you tell me
[8/10/17, 3:46:14 PM] Steve: Since you are a guru
[8/10/17, 3:46:14 PM] Launchpad: You think that google thinks women are less than men?
[8/10/17, 3:46:24 PM] Steve: No, I think daily wire does
[8/10/17, 3:46:29 PM] Steve: Which is where he article is from
[8/10/17, 3:46:49 PM] Steve: Or do you not even know where you got the article from?
[8/10/17, 3:47:00 PM] Steve: Just because you found it on google doesn't mean it's from google
[8/10/17, 3:50:39 PM] Launchpad: I posted an article about Google,  not the daily wire. Are you suggesting that the facts involved in the article are wrong or do you just not agree with the tone and opinion
[8/10/17, 3:50:53 PM] Steve: Ok
[8/10/17, 3:50:57 PM] Steve: Let's see if you follow
[8/10/17, 3:51:03 PM] Steve: I'm going to do this in pieces
[8/10/17, 3:51:22 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/10/17, 3:52:11 PM] Steve: You know what, who cares
[8/10/17, 3:52:20 PM] Steve: You are right and I'm wrong
[8/10/17, 3:52:26 PM] Steve: Keep reading the daily wire
[8/10/17, 3:52:36 PM] Steve: I don't know why I care what you say anymore
[8/10/17, 3:53:19 PM] Launchpad: I'm just pointing out the irony in the situation, you are freaking out about the source which cited npr
[8/10/17, 3:53:55 PM] Steve: Yup, freaking out
[8/10/17, 3:54:10 PM] Steve: Again, I'll do my best to avoid reading anything you write or post
[8/10/17, 3:54:38 PM] Justin: i mean what steve is saying is even if true, some random person speculating that the reason women stayed home was they had their emotions hurt....isnt news
[8/10/17, 3:54:48 PM] Justin: they could have stayed home in solidarity

[8/12/17, 2:51:31 PM] Justin: Damn this white nationalist guy just plowed people over
[8/12/17, 2:53:28 PM] Justin: Eagerly await how white mentally ill man killed 20 runs across the news @17189742074
[8/12/17, 2:54:13 PM] Justin: Does word terrorism flash on any news station?
[8/12/17, 2:57:52 PM] Steve: Not for white people
[8/12/17, 2:57:59 PM] Steve: I would wholeheartedly agree with that
[8/12/17, 2:58:20 PM] Steve: White people mass killing are just "disturbed individuals"
[8/12/17, 2:58:35 PM] Steve: It's actually a crazy hypocrisy that is seemingly accepted
[8/12/17, 3:39:17 PM] Steve: It is on a cigarette box, obvi.
[8/12/17, 3:39:55 PM] Justin: Damn. Is that lp new tinder profile pic?
[8/12/17, 3:41:05 PM] Steve: Like, is that what you do when you are impotent?
[8/12/17, 3:41:21 PM] Justin: Idk that's fucked up.
[8/12/17, 3:42:01 PM] Justin: Think cogerette company should launch add campaign like "fuck condoms, we'll help you shoot blanks"
[8/12/17, 3:51:07 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah, but that's a good way to get people to stop
[8/12/17, 3:51:36 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/12/17, 3:54:43 PM] Miller: Dunkirk was lit
[8/12/17, 3:57:26 PM] Dan Watts: First of all why the fuck are you singling me out for what my thoughts are about this white nationalism incident?
[8/12/17, 3:58:23 PM] Justin: Terrorism
[8/12/17, 3:58:35 PM] Justin: And all the Muslim terrorism.
[8/12/17, 3:59:12 PM] Steve: Don't know why he was doing that. But agree with the sentiment. Not the singling out.
[8/12/17, 3:59:37 PM] Justin: Nothing to do wth white nationalists. I could give a fuck less about those pieces of shit. I just want to call a spade a spade and Muslim terrorism is not an American threat
[8/12/17, 4:00:10 PM] Justin: Sorry if it seemed like I'm saying you condone their actions, didn't mean that in anyway
[8/12/17, 4:00:07 PM] Dan Watts: There's been 30,000 Muslim terrorist stacks since 911. Is there another ideology religious or otherwise that has anywhere close to that amount
[8/12/17, 4:00:16 PM] Steve: Guy
[8/12/17, 4:00:19 PM] Justin: How many in America?
[8/12/17, 4:00:27 PM] Steve: We are talking about this country
[8/12/17, 4:00:31 PM] Steve: Not around the world
[8/12/17, 4:00:50 PM] Justin: Weird. Leading economy in the world had had 3/30000
[8/12/17, 4:00:59 PM] Steve: White men with guns much more of a threat in the US than extreme terrorism
[8/12/17, 4:01:01 PM] Miller: Fwiw Republican Virginia Congressman, Thomas Garrett, refers to the Charlottesville incident as "political terrorism."
[8/12/17, 4:01:03 PM] Steve: With all donrespect
[8/12/17, 4:01:19 PM] Steve: Call it what you want
[8/12/17, 4:01:26 PM] Steve: Terrorism is terrorism
[8/12/17, 4:01:33 PM] Steve: Our president won't tweet about it
[8/12/17, 4:01:41 PM] Steve: That's üíØfact
[8/12/17, 4:03:23 PM] Miller: He already made some stupid statement
[8/12/17, 4:03:54 PM] Miller: @kylegriffin1: Trump: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides. On many sides." https://t.co/w8eqvResnc
[8/12/17, 4:04:17 PM] Steve: Did he tweet it?
[8/12/17, 4:04:28 PM] Steve: Because that's he only official statement he gives
[8/12/17, 4:04:47 PM] Steve: I don't care about the BS White House statements
[8/12/17, 4:05:32 PM] Steve: I've been told for 6 months that's is his way to communicate with the people
[8/12/17, 4:05:35 PM] Steve: So...
[8/12/17, 4:06:29 PM] Steve: I'll wait
[8/12/17, 4:08:41 PM] Justin: "On many sides "
[8/12/17, 4:09:28 PM] Steve: Gotta keep the bannon people kind of happy
[8/12/17, 5:38:07 PM] Steve: So we just ate dinner for 14
[8/12/17, 5:38:59 PM] Steve: We ordered 4 orders of Spanish omelet, 5 orders of pork loin with fries, 4 orders of baked octopus, 4 salads and 4 bottles of wine
[8/12/17, 5:39:11 PM] Steve: Along with a couple of drinks, after dinner drinks and coffee
[8/12/17, 5:39:30 PM] Steve: And will pay approximately $35-$50
[8/12/17, 5:39:47 PM] Steve: Each

[8/12/17, 5:47:50 PM] Brian Katz: I'm moving to Spain
[8/12/17, 5:49:30 PM] Steve: I have an apartment for you
[8/12/17, 5:49:40 PM] Steve: 3 bedroom, two bath
[8/12/17, 6:00:15 PM] Scott: How much is a two bedroom apt to purchase ?
[8/12/17, 6:00:21 PM] Scott: Roughly. American dollars. Just curious.
[8/12/17, 6:00:32 PM] Steve: Depends

[8/12/17, 6:00:48 PM] Steve: 1/2 bedroom
[8/12/17, 6:16:16 PM] Steve: I lied, the bill came out to 26 euros per person
[8/12/17, 6:16:24 PM] Steve: Actually insane
[8/12/17, 6:16:37 PM] Steve: It would be @15166335046 best check experience
[8/12/17, 7:38:02 PM] Miller: I'm sure cheese still wouldn't pay
[8/12/17, 7:44:10 PM] Justin: I'm sure he would pay more than enough.
[8/12/17, 7:55:32 PM] Scott: Lolz
[8/12/17, 7:55:44 PM] Scott: Scottie wouldn't make it to the dinner.
[8/12/17, 7:57:27 PM] Brian Katz: I hear that if you slap $$40 and say that you've left more than enough, you can just walk out on the tab.
[8/12/17, 7:57:54 PM] Scott: No.
[8/12/17, 9:08:50 PM] Brian Katz: Watching a documentary, and basically, anything that's made from an animal that we consume is killing us lol. Dear god what are we supposed to eat?
[8/12/17, 9:10:07 PM] Dan Watts: Pussy
[8/12/17, 9:11:37 PM] Brian Katz: It says that eating this stuf can make men's hairlines recede and give them random whiskey dick.
[8/12/17, 9:11:43 PM] Brian Katz: Stuff*
[8/12/17, 9:12:08 PM] Steve: I eat pussy well

[8/12/17, 9:16:10 PM] Brian Katz: You know the documentary I speak of?
[8/12/17, 9:16:16 PM] Justin: Assuming this the Netflix one that's new

[8/12/17, 9:20:36 PM] Dan Watts: In my case I'm pretty sure it's form genetics and excessive fireball consumption
[8/12/17, 9:20:47 PM] Brian Katz: Lol

[8/12/17, 9:24:42 PM] Justin: Apple is scary
[8/12/17, 9:24:50 PM] Justin: Like a freaky stalker
[8/12/17, 9:24:50 PM] Brian Katz: It's worked for tens of joia? There's more than one?
[8/12/17, 9:25:37 PM] Justin: Actually Joia had an ex that was dating another Joia at the same time.
[8/12/17, 9:26:01 PM] Justin: Joia was the side chick
[8/12/17, 9:26:25 PM] Brian Katz: That sounds like a Snapple fact
[8/12/17, 9:36:31 PM] Scott: Why u call me out?
[8/12/17, 9:40:03 PM] Dan Watts: Bc @15166335046 and I are still power couple
[8/12/17, 9:40:08 PM] Dan Watts: Steve and Sean are boos again
[8/12/17, 9:40:17 PM] Dan Watts: Your assed out bro sorry
[8/12/17, 9:40:30 PM] Steve: A lot of hate
[8/12/17, 9:40:38 PM] Scott: That's fine.
[8/12/17, 9:43:09 PM] Miller: Last words cheese said to me "I'm giving you money"
[8/12/17, 9:43:20 PM] Miller: Any day now..
[8/12/17, 9:43:35 PM] Dan Watts: Famous last words
[8/12/17, 9:43:37 PM] Dan Watts: As they say
[8/12/17, 9:59:29 PM] Justin: In case you didn't want to click kat. Think these 3 paragraphs sums up youre good.
[8/12/17, 10:09:06 PM] Miller: That doesn't look like any cock I've ever seen tbh
[8/12/17, 10:21:22 PM] Brian Katz: Looks like a dickhead and half a shaft
[8/12/17, 10:28:34 PM] Justin: No way that nerd 2nd from the left got any friends
[8/12/17, 10:32:48 PM] Dan Watts: This Is true
[8/12/17, 10:33:59 PM] Dan Watts: Today @16316620763 called
Me alt right bc I stated facts about global terrorism
[8/12/17, 10:35:44 PM] Justin: I mean sure.
[8/12/17, 10:35:49 PM] Dan Watts: See
[8/12/17, 10:35:59 PM] Miller: Twitter fingers turn to whatsapp fingers
[8/12/17, 10:36:10 PM] Justin: Should add in global terrorism minus the only place any of as actually live
[8/12/17, 10:36:11 PM] Dan Watts: Lmaoooo
[8/12/17, 10:46:11 PM] Justin: I mean when Christian fanactics shoot up mosques and kill abortion doctors,  i don't see the argument that we should blame Christianity. If Islam is as savage as you claim, simple math would dictate the ratio of Christian extremism to Muslim extremeism in the us would dictate we have an extremely severe Christian fundamentalist problem. Or you can apply some logic and realize that the lack of legitimate political and economic structures has led to a breeding ground that has been exploited by religious fundamentalists in that area. The us has and continues to create such conditions, so pretending like we are at war with savagery while corporations print money on the death of millions, perhaps isn't useful.
[8/13/17, 12:12:49 AM] Miller: Happy birthday @16316620763

[8/13/17, 12:35:12 AM] Tk: Mashawn Lynch sits during national anthem. Guessing the Raiders didn't get the memo when they signed him. BeastMode does what he dos.
[8/13/17, 12:51:12 AM] Steve: Praise be to Lynch
[8/13/17, 12:52:44 AM] Donk: Happy birthday herm!
[8/13/17, 12:58:09 AM] Tk: I almost wish he declared that he'd seat before signing. Just to gauge if teams would've signed him anyways.
[8/13/17, 1:06:48 AM] Steve: Every team would want one year of beast mode over what they have
[8/13/17, 1:07:16 AM] Steve: Steelers and cowboys only two teams that are good

[8/14/17, 7:43:56 PM] Miller: It's like me saying I could be as good as Phil ivey if I wanted to
[8/14/17, 7:44:38 PM] Steve: To @16316620763's credit, LP also thinks he's as good as ed Sheehan at guitar

[8/14/17, 7:45:18 PM] Miller: Sure, everyone is as good as him, it's easy
[8/14/17, 7:45:30 PM] Steve: That's literally what LP said
[8/14/17, 7:45:58 PM] Steve: #justsaying
[8/14/17, 7:46:03 PM] Miller: White privilege is every white person thinking they can play guitar
[8/14/17, 7:46:16 PM] Justin: I'm as good as tebow at baseball?
[8/14/17, 7:46:17 PM] Steve: Nope
[8/14/17, 7:46:22 PM] Justin: Where the fuck that come from ?
[8/14/17, 7:46:21 PM] Steve: You are better than that
[8/14/17, 7:47:11 PM] Justin: Also if ed Sheeran. If I said anything it was ed sheeran doesn't really do much on guitar.
[8/14/17, 7:47:39 PM] Steve: Stop @16316620763
[8/14/17, 7:47:44 PM] Steve: He does fucking plenty
[8/14/17, 7:47:53 PM] Steve: He's an incredible talent
[8/14/17, 7:48:18 PM] Steve: Just because you and @16195657200 think that you two are even close to that is an absolutely fucking joke
[8/14/17, 7:48:25 PM] Justin: But you are becoming a king of hyperbole
[8/14/17, 7:48:30 PM] Justin: I am terrible at guitar
[8/14/17, 7:48:31 PM] Steve: It's almost a ridiculous as you saying
[8/14/17, 7:48:40 PM] Justin: I would never say I'm as good.
[8/14/17, 7:48:40 PM] Steve: Hey, I am awesome at FIFA
[8/14/17, 7:48:47 PM] Steve: I can basically be Messi
[8/14/17, 7:48:53 PM] Steve: GTFO
[8/14/17, 7:49:03 PM] Justin: I'd say I can learn an ed sheeran song in limited time. Because it's not difficult. Lp actually plays guitar well.
[8/14/17, 7:49:11 PM] Steve: No you cannot
[8/14/17, 7:49:29 PM] Steve: And I would put money you couldn't learn it in a month if I paid for the lesson
[8/14/17, 7:49:43 PM] Steve: I'll do it
[8/14/17, 7:49:51 PM] Justin: Lol.
[8/14/17, 7:50:10 PM] Steve: I'll give you a month to play it as it's on any tour
[8/14/17, 7:50:20 PM] Justin: If you paid for the lesson I'd play it well
[8/14/17, 7:50:19 PM] Steve: And I'll pay for the lesson
[8/14/17, 7:50:35 PM] Steve: If you can't, you can pay the lesson back and $1000
[8/14/17, 7:50:53 PM] Steve: Shit ill even pay you $1000
[8/14/17, 7:51:01 PM] Justin: I get to chose the song. I haven't picked up a guitar in months and this may be easiet bet I've ever made
[8/14/17, 7:51:04 PM] Steve: After you can play a song as well
[8/14/17, 7:51:21 PM] Justin: Who said as well?
[8/14/17, 7:51:31 PM] Justin: Who judges as well
[8/14/17, 7:51:53 PM] Justin: You telling me any random guy in a coffeehouse can't run a cover of ed sheeran song "as well"
[8/14/17, 7:52:03 PM] Steve: I'll play the album
[8/14/17, 7:52:09 PM] Steve: And we can get a panel
[8/14/17, 7:52:20 PM] Steve: Or a YouTube video of him live
[8/14/17, 7:52:23 PM] Steve: No problem
[8/14/17, 7:52:26 PM] Steve: YouTube exists
[8/14/17, 7:52:58 PM] Justin: So now it's not that the song is soffficult to play
[8/14/17, 7:53:18 PM] Justin: It's you have to play the song as well as guy who were the song and has practiced guitar for his entire life
[8/14/17, 7:53:54 PM] Steve: Yup
[8/14/17, 7:53:59 PM] Steve: That's what I'm saying herman
[8/14/17, 7:54:04 PM] Justin: That's stupid
[8/14/17, 7:54:05 PM] Steve: You have to play as well as him
[8/14/17, 7:54:08 PM] Steve: Which you can't
[8/14/17, 7:54:09 PM] Steve: Thank you
[8/14/17, 7:54:12 PM] Steve: We agree
[8/14/17, 7:54:14 PM] Steve: Perfect
[8/14/17, 7:54:16 PM] Steve: So now
[8/14/17, 7:54:18 PM] Steve: Shut the fuck up
[8/14/17, 7:54:22 PM] Steve: And go to bed
[8/14/17, 7:54:35 PM] Justin: I bet you can't throw a baseball
[8/14/17, 7:54:37 PM] Steve: Still love you
[8/14/17, 7:54:40 PM] Steve: But you are wrong
[8/14/17, 7:54:46 PM] Justin: I bet you can't
[8/14/17, 7:54:50 PM] Steve: And I just proved it by you agreeing
[8/14/17, 7:55:01 PM] Justin: I bet you can't throw a baseball
[8/14/17, 7:54:59 PM] Steve: You see hat right?
[8/14/17, 7:55:04 PM] Steve: Doesn't take spoiler player to see
[8/14/17, 7:55:09 PM] Steve: *poker
[8/14/17, 7:55:24 PM] Justin: You won't take my bet
[8/14/17, 7:55:32 PM] Justin: Fine you obviously can't throw a baseball
[8/14/17, 7:57:48 PM] Justin: if you cant see the huge goal post shift in saying you cant play an ed sheeran song versus you cant play an ed sheeran song as good as ed sheeran, I dont know what to tell you
[8/14/17, 7:59:59 PM] Justin: back to tebow, i told you so miller
[8/14/17, 8:01:02 PM] Miller: You don't think a guy who hasn't played baseball at any level in 10 years holding his own in high levels of minor leagues is impressive? Tough crowd
[8/14/17, 8:01:16 PM] Miller: You should watch espn 30 for 30 Jordan rides the bus
[8/14/17, 8:01:55 PM] Justin: well i mean i suppose "holds his own" needs some clarification
[8/14/17, 8:02:02 PM] Justin: i mean he was in bottom 10% in a ball
[8/14/17, 8:02:27 PM] Justin: whats he in now in high A ball?  But yeh if you wantto hear hes a talented althete, sure hes cleary a talented athlete
[8/14/17, 8:04:22 PM] Miller: A 700 ops in high a ball I would consider holding his own
[8/14/17, 8:04:48 PM] Miller: He's not embarrassing himself and he's flashed some skill
[8/14/17, 8:05:55 PM] Brian Katz: He's okay lol
[8/14/17, 8:08:35 PM] Justin: id sy the guy who listens to songs with acoustic guitar all day, and has actually picked up an acoustic guitar, has some idea of the difficulty of most acoustic songs...but hey its much easier to make claims like ed sheeran is equvialent to prince on guitar
[8/14/17, 8:08:44 PM] Justin: so go for it
[8/14/17, 8:09:16 PM] Justin: maybe you should tweet ed sheeran and ask him what he thinks
[8/14/17, 8:10:02 PM] Brian Katz: I'm talking FIFA
[8/14/17, 8:12:04 PM] Scott: This sheeran bet us grwat
[8/14/17, 8:12:07 PM] Scott: Great
[8/14/17, 8:12:12 PM] Scott: Can we put it on the board ?
[8/14/17, 8:12:25 PM] Scott: @16316620763 @13478047760
[8/14/17, 8:12:59 PM] Justin: like i said when steve takes my he cant throw a baseball bet
[8/14/17, 8:14:40 PM] Steve: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[8/14/17, 8:15:49 PM] Miller: Was a full dj booth really necessary? I've hosted more people with a Bluetooth speaker
[8/14/17, 8:16:15 PM] Miller: Also I'm disappointed because I thought for sure it was gonna be some ed sheeran
[8/14/17, 8:17:05 PM] Justin: that dj coudlnt possibly understand the difficulty of palying ed sheeran
[8/14/17, 8:17:31 PM] Justin: shocked hes able to play music at all
[8/14/17, 8:17:41 PM] Justin: and all those crazy people are dancing
[8/14/17, 8:20:07 PM] Justin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIc1EBbf1Vg
[8/14/17, 8:22:02 PM] Miller: https://youtu.be/_ZhoVX1b4zU
[8/14/17, 8:22:19 PM] Brian Katz: Tool sucks
[8/14/17, 8:33:49 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 1:03:21 PM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 1:03:49 PM] Scott: how did that happne?
[8/15/17, 1:04:16 PM] Dan Watts: Not relevant
[8/15/17, 1:04:22 PM] Steve: I got a good body guy if you are willing to claim it
[8/15/17, 1:04:34 PM] Steve: If not, he's pricey but great
[8/15/17, 1:05:16 PM] Dan Watts: Prob don't want to report it
[8/15/17, 1:08:02 PM] Steve: Well then it will be pricey
[8/15/17, 1:08:23 PM] Dan Watts: ~1g?
[8/15/17, 1:08:40 PM] Brian Katz: No way
[8/15/17, 1:08:59 PM] Brian Katz: And you did it drunk I'm assuming or hit and run?
[8/15/17, 1:09:09 PM] Dan Watts: Definitely not
[8/15/17, 1:09:55 PM] Brian Katz: I had to replace my bumper this winter was like 1200 for my ram
[8/15/17, 1:10:25 PM] Steve: That's going to cost more
[8/15/17, 1:10:33 PM] Steve: They may have to replace the hood
[8/15/17, 1:11:35 PM] Dan Watts: Might have to claim it as an act of vandalism then
[8/15/17, 1:11:46 PM] Steve: That's fine
[8/15/17, 1:11:49 PM] Dan Watts: $500 deductible then
[8/15/17, 1:11:54 PM] Steve: These guys are fantastic
[8/15/17, 1:11:55 PM] Dan Watts: But better than the alternative
[8/15/17, 1:12:07 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[8/15/17, 1:12:10 PM] Steve: Most of the time it is
[8/15/17, 1:12:17 PM] Steve: Insurance could go up though
[8/15/17, 1:12:18 PM] Steve: Monthly
[8/15/17, 1:12:23 PM] Steve: You always run that risk
[8/15/17, 1:18:22 PM] Dan Watts: My insurance is already crazy cheap bc my car is registered in SI
[8/15/17, 1:18:44 PM] Steve: That will probably run you between 1-2k
[8/15/17, 1:18:51 PM] Steve: But if you claim, $500
[8/15/17, 1:19:06 PM] Steve: I'll get the number of them from my father
[8/15/17, 1:19:21 PM] Dan Watts: Ok thanks bud
[8/15/17, 1:21:03 PM] Launchpad: sick shot!
[8/15/17, 1:25:55 PM] Miller: insurance increase only lasts for 3 yrs
[8/15/17, 1:26:03 PM] Miller: you can find out how much it will go up
[8/15/17, 1:26:05 PM] Miller: and then simple math problem
[8/15/17, 1:26:21 PM] Miller: i claimed something a few yrs back b/c cost me less over 3yr period
[8/15/17, 1:26:46 PM] Justin: insurance still gonna go up with vandalism claim
[8/15/17, 1:27:02 PM] Miller: insurance is gonna go up w/any claim
[8/15/17, 1:27:21 PM] Justin: mine shot up from 1200-1800 when my car bumper got hit on side of road
[8/15/17, 1:27:57 PM] Miller: $600/yr for 3yrs plus deductible? might have been better off getting it fixed on your own
[8/15/17, 1:28:12 PM] Justin: would have been better off
[8/15/17, 1:28:16 PM] Miller: mine was gonna be 3k to fix on my own so claiming it made sense
[8/15/17, 1:28:25 PM] Justin: althoguh i changed insurance company and it was lower
[8/15/17, 1:29:01 PM] Justin: and time after that i got fixed by guy my dad uses in deer park....cheap off the books type
[8/15/17, 1:29:17 PM] Justin: id give you his info watts but he takes forever, quality likely blah...but its cheap
[8/15/17, 1:29:44 PM] Justin: also dont bmw's require authorized repairs?
[8/15/17, 1:30:10 PM] Miller: thats not a thing
[8/15/17, 1:31:25 PM] Justin: thought all parts are made specific for bmw
[8/15/17, 1:32:34 PM] Miller: maybe? idk, never heard of anything like that
[8/15/17, 1:33:00 PM] Steve: Yes
[8/15/17, 1:33:11 PM] Steve: Many luxury cars have that
[8/15/17, 1:33:19 PM] Steve: BMW/Mercedes
[8/15/17, 1:33:33 PM] Steve: Have to go back to the manufacturer
[8/15/17, 1:33:52 PM] Steve: Also, I had an accident almost 5 years ago and my insurance hasn't decreased on the Honda
[8/15/17, 1:33:59 PM] Steve: It went up $40 a month
[8/15/17, 1:34:12 PM] Steve: The total damage was over 6k
[8/15/17, 1:34:38 PM] Steve: Also, very rarely is it worth not going through the insurance
[8/15/17, 1:34:46 PM] Steve: Body work is expensive as shit
[8/15/17, 1:34:51 PM] Steve: At least if you want it done well
[8/15/17, 1:35:48 PM] Dan Watts: I own the car so pretty sure I can send wherever
[8/15/17, 1:35:57 PM] Dan Watts: But I'll call geico
[8/15/17, 1:36:05 PM] Dan Watts: Need a new radiator and fans
[8/15/17, 1:36:09 PM] Dan Watts: Costing me like $300
[8/15/17, 1:36:14 PM] Miller: if your deductible is $500 and cost of repair is like 1k its probably not worth it (was the case for me when i rear ended someone very lightly)
[8/15/17, 1:36:17 PM] Dan Watts: Plus tow  as $150
[8/15/17, 1:36:37 PM] Miller: but in general yes everything with cars is fucking ludicrously expensive
[8/15/17, 1:37:17 PM] Dan Watts: I rear ended someone very lightly however that someone was a tractor trailer with a high bumper parallel to my hood
[8/15/17, 1:38:17 PM] Miller: ugh
[8/15/17, 1:39:55 PM] Brian Katz: That sucks
[8/15/17, 1:40:53 PM] Donk: Damn, 150 for a tow?
[8/15/17, 1:41:05 PM] Donk: Gotta get that AAA
[8/15/17, 1:45:14 PM] Dan Watts: Waited 2 hours
[8/15/17, 1:45:20 PM] Dan Watts: That was the worst part
[8/15/17, 1:46:16 PM] Donk: Yeah that blows
[8/15/17, 1:46:28 PM] Donk: Though aaa would probably take that long too fwiw
[8/15/17, 1:47:00 PM] Donk: My issue with german cars is that the parts are always so damn expensive
[8/15/17, 1:47:16 PM] Donk: At least in comparison to Japanese ones
[8/15/17, 1:47:17 PM] Launchpad: fucken took  me 10 hours to get home from Colorado yesterday it was miserable
[8/15/17, 1:48:55 PM] Miller: you get towed?
[8/15/17, 1:51:08 PM] Steve: AAA is free though
[8/15/17, 1:51:23 PM] Steve: So do you still need the number @17189742074 or will you figure it out?
[8/15/17, 1:52:43 PM] Donk: *free for a tow, but there is a yearly membership fee
[8/15/17, 1:59:08 PM] Dan Watts: I'll take number thank you
[8/15/17, 2:00:46 PM] Steve: Free for many tows
[8/15/17, 2:00:55 PM] Steve: Yearly fee of $100 big ones
[8/15/17, 2:01:09 PM] Steve: Which is nothing
[8/15/17, 2:01:17 PM] Steve: A tow costs 165 on average
[8/15/17, 2:01:22 PM] Steve: In the city
[8/15/17, 2:12:39 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 2:12:41 PM] Miller: that is all, ty
[8/15/17, 2:13:00 PM] Miller: please check back next month for the next episode of #LifeWithJones
[8/15/17, 2:47:48 PM] Scott: anyone interested in going to barcelona in a month or maybe soon thereafter?
[8/15/17, 2:51:18 PM] Brian Katz: EJ Arana probably is
[8/15/17, 2:53:11 PM] Miller: i mean 20% of the ppl in this group are currently in spain
[8/15/17, 2:53:15 PM] Miller: seems like pretty low odds
[8/15/17, 2:53:45 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/15/17, 2:53:58 PM] Brian Katz: I'll go to a Spanish restaurant with you in a few weeks
[8/15/17, 2:54:02 PM] Steve: Only cheese plans a trip to Spain after people from Spain go to Spain
[8/15/17, 2:54:10 PM] Brian Katz: Btw where's my cheese day?
[8/15/17, 2:54:18 PM] Miller: its in barelona
[8/15/17, 2:54:30 PM] Miller: the ultimate katz punishment, you have to get on a plane
[8/15/17, 2:54:35 PM] Scott: oooooooooooooo
[8/15/17, 2:54:38 PM] Scott: katz come with me to barcelona
[8/15/17, 2:54:38 PM] Brian Katz: Is that naked Barcelona?
[8/15/17, 2:54:53 PM] Miller: if you want, i think most ppl are gonna be wearing clothes
[8/15/17, 2:55:02 PM] Scott: air bnbs are liek $40 a night
[8/15/17, 2:55:03 PM] Scott: and nice
[8/15/17, 2:55:26 PM] Brian Katz: I'll pass mi amigo
[8/15/17, 2:55:33 PM] Miller: cheese just needs someone else to rent it for him
[8/15/17, 2:55:59 PM] Brian Katz: EJ will surely go though
[8/15/17, 2:56:08 PM] Steve: I will confirm, most people in Barcelona wear clothing
[8/15/17, 2:56:19 PM] Steve: Some may go topless on the beach
[8/15/17, 2:56:32 PM] Scott: stop that
[8/15/17, 2:56:44 PM] Scott: that was directed at miller
[8/15/17, 2:57:19 PM] Steve: Cheese, you realize the flights will be $800-$1000 right?
[8/15/17, 2:57:55 PM] Steve: Also, those $40 air bnbs do not have air conditioning
[8/15/17, 2:58:14 PM] Steve: Basically renting a place with a small fan in a place with a climate of Florida
[8/15/17, 2:58:31 PM] Brian Katz: Dear god
[8/15/17, 2:58:33 PM] Steve: Please sit down and do research
[8/15/17, 2:58:34 PM] Scott: steve
[8/15/17, 2:58:42 PM] Scott: i have miles
[8/15/17, 2:58:46 PM] Scott: its $48 roundtrip
[8/15/17, 2:58:47 PM] Scott: second
[8/15/17, 2:58:53 PM] Scott: i would be going in a month, i dont give a fuck
[8/15/17, 2:58:59 PM] Scott: the ones with air conditioning are 60 a night
[8/15/17, 2:59:01 PM] Scott: and id do that
[8/15/17, 2:59:03 PM] Steve: It's still that hot in a month
[8/15/17, 2:59:10 PM] Scott: how about you sit down and ask questions before making assumptions
[8/15/17, 2:59:19 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 2:59:21 PM] Steve: Because I have the answers
[8/15/17, 2:59:27 PM] Steve: I have been there
[8/15/17, 2:59:35 PM] Steve: Rented an airbnb there
[8/15/17, 2:59:38 PM] Steve: And know where to go
[8/15/17, 3:00:50 PM] Scott: i wanna rent an airbnb near barceloneta beach
[8/15/17, 3:00:54 PM] Scott: or sagrada familia
[8/15/17, 3:00:57 PM] Scott: because of their locatino
[8/15/17, 3:01:09 PM] Scott: It would cost around $500 for an airbnb wiht a/c
[8/15/17, 3:01:12 PM] Scott: the flight would be nominal
[8/15/17, 3:01:13 PM] Steve: Those are two very different locations
[8/15/17, 3:01:13 PM] Miller: locatino? you better get your spanish in check before this trip
[8/15/17, 3:01:17 PM] Scott: haha
[8/15/17, 3:01:20 PM] Scott: i know
[8/15/17, 3:01:25 PM] Scott: ive been there, i like both of those locations
[8/15/17, 3:01:35 PM] Scott: i wonder what vacationing by myself would be like though
[8/15/17, 3:01:40 PM] Steve: I would not want to be by sagrada familia
[8/15/17, 3:01:47 PM] Scott: how come?
[8/15/17, 3:01:49 PM] Scott: where woudl u wanna be?
[8/15/17, 3:01:49 PM] Steve: It's like getting an airbnb by Times Square
[8/15/17, 3:01:54 PM] Miller: take your gf
[8/15/17, 3:01:55 PM] Steve: By the beach
[8/15/17, 3:01:58 PM] Miller: go hit up paris

[8/15/17, 3:03:20 PM] Steve: Or stay by las ramblas
[8/15/17, 3:03:25 PM] Steve: That's a good spot too
[8/15/17, 3:04:20 PM] Launchpad: didnt you just ask us if we want to go?
[8/15/17, 3:04:50 PM] Donk: He doesnt want to find out
[8/15/17, 3:05:10 PM] Scott: i'm saying if i was to go myself
[8/15/17, 3:05:13 PM] Scott: does anyone wanna go also?
[8/15/17, 3:05:22 PM] Scott: gotya
[8/15/17, 3:05:22 PM] Launchpad: go to Camp No Counselors by yourself
[8/15/17, 3:05:30 PM] Scott: i dunno about that scottie
[8/15/17, 3:05:33 PM] Steve: Pretty sure no one can/wants to go
[8/15/17, 3:05:53 PM] Launchpad: Good - keep your negativity out of it
[8/15/17, 3:06:12 PM] Launchpad: but really, who likes sick 3 day long parties anyway?
[8/15/17, 3:06:54 PM] Donk: I went to a concert by myself once, it was a bit weird
[8/15/17, 3:07:08 PM] Steve: People who want to travel
[8/15/17, 3:07:14 PM] Steve: And not just party
[8/15/17, 3:07:20 PM] Scott: ill be honest, barcelona is amazing
[8/15/17, 3:07:23 PM] Scott: i wanna go back
[8/15/17, 3:07:29 PM] Steve: It's my favorite city
[8/15/17, 3:07:31 PM] Scott: hence why i think id go there
[8/15/17, 3:07:40 PM] Scott: and the fact it was my honeymoon mucked up my memories of it, wanna redo that
[8/15/17, 3:07:42 PM] Steve: But it's def better to go with at least one other person
[8/15/17, 3:07:49 PM] Launchpad: https://www.campnocounselors.com/locations/?gclid=CjwKCAjwt8rMBRBOEiwA2F2biLiJKhaa_xJGCBHuY_4xM6o0AMe8YD0dydyK4KflP5w47yWDc17QuBoCCcoQAvD_BwE
[8/15/17, 3:07:56 PM] Brian Katz: http://www.metalsucks.net/2017/08/14/pro-trump-rally-set-to-clash-with-juggalo-march-in-washington-d-c-in-september/
[8/15/17, 3:07:58 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/15/17, 3:08:23 PM] Miller: im totally shocked the juggalos are anti-trump, i really would have guessed like 75% overlap in their bases
[8/15/17, 3:08:52 PM] Steve: Parties are still not better than traveling and seeing new places
[8/15/17, 3:08:59 PM] Steve: You can send all the links you want
[8/15/17, 3:09:45 PM] Launchpad: you mean links of new places all over the country you can go camping at?
[8/15/17, 3:10:00 PM] Launchpad: like I literally "travelled" to Denver for camp
[8/15/17, 3:10:07 PM] Steve: That's still a 3 day festival of partying
[8/15/17, 3:10:15 PM] Steve: Which involves massive amount of drinking
[8/15/17, 3:10:24 PM] Steve: All things that don't allow you to actually see anything
[8/15/17, 3:10:32 PM] Steve: Just be fucked up
[8/15/17, 3:10:39 PM] Steve: If you want to do that
[8/15/17, 3:10:41 PM] Steve: Do you
[8/15/17, 3:10:56 PM] Brian Katz: To be fair have you frank most of the days in Spain?
[8/15/17, 3:11:03 PM] Brian Katz: Drank*
[8/15/17, 3:11:11 PM] Steve: I'm going to portugal and also drinking
[8/15/17, 3:11:20 PM] Brian Katz: So what's the difference
[8/15/17, 3:11:22 PM] Steve: But I go see things
[8/15/17, 3:11:24 PM] Launchpad: look, Im not trying to make this a pissing contest over vacation -- what I'm saying is that camp is an incredibly amazing experience and would guarantee everyone would have a great time
[8/15/17, 3:11:35 PM] Steve: It's a party
[8/15/17, 3:11:35 PM] Launchpad: And Austin?
[8/15/17, 3:11:42 PM] Steve: Exactly
[8/15/17, 3:11:48 PM] Steve: That's also a party
[8/15/17, 3:12:16 PM] Steve: Not the same as going to see new places
[8/15/17, 3:12:27 PM] Miller: guarantee everyone will have a great time?

ü§î
[8/15/17, 3:12:34 PM] Steve: And experiencing new food and new cultures
[8/15/17, 3:12:44 PM] Launchpad: unless you only consider cities places, and not the mountains....
[8/15/17, 3:12:46 PM] Steve: Now Austin is close to that because it's seeing a new place
[8/15/17, 3:13:03 PM] Donk: Why cant you do both?
[8/15/17, 3:13:07 PM] Steve: But it's still mainly just drinking
[8/15/17, 3:13:09 PM] Steve: You can
[8/15/17, 3:13:15 PM] Steve: But that is not what this camp thing is
[8/15/17, 3:13:24 PM] Donk: If you do one it doesnt mean you cant do the other
[8/15/17, 3:13:24 PM] Steve: It's actually the stupidest argument we've ever had
[8/15/17, 3:13:25 PM] Miller: clearly very different avenues, the camp thing is more to go meet new people
[8/15/17, 3:13:27 PM] Launchpad: hahaha funny thats the one you linked
[8/15/17, 3:13:28 PM] Brian Katz: It's also hooking up
[8/15/17, 3:13:33 PM] Scott: so no one wants to go to barcelona with me?
[8/15/17, 3:13:34 PM] Scott: lol
[8/15/17, 3:13:38 PM] Launchpad: thank you!
[8/15/17, 3:13:41 PM] Steve: LP is saying doing this camp shit is the same thing as going to Austin
[8/15/17, 3:13:44 PM] Steve: Or Spain
[8/15/17, 3:13:47 PM] Steve: And it's not
[8/15/17, 3:13:51 PM] Steve: That's fuckingn idiotic
[8/15/17, 3:13:55 PM] Steve: And ludicrous
[8/15/17, 3:14:05 PM] Steve: It has similarities
[8/15/17, 3:14:14 PM] Miller: if i was single and going somewhere by myself id rather go to launchpads stupid camp thing then go to barelona personally
[8/15/17, 3:14:19 PM] Steve: It's like saying going to Austin is like going to bonaroo
[8/15/17, 3:14:36 PM] Steve: Also a stupid comparison
[8/15/17, 3:14:46 PM] Launchpad: I am not saying its the 'same thing' -- I'm saying its an amazing experience, so stop being such a debbie downer
[8/15/17, 3:14:51 PM] Steve: Again, not the argument we are having
[8/15/17, 3:15:27 PM] Steve: You saying it's the same thing
[8/15/17, 3:15:27 PM] Launchpad: so what if I caught a show at Red Rocks while in Denver?
[8/15/17, 3:15:38 PM] Steve: Also you saying it's the same thing
[8/15/17, 3:15:54 PM] Steve: Then you would be going to a concert
[8/15/17, 3:16:01 PM] Steve: Not a theee day camping party
[8/15/17, 3:16:11 PM] Launchpad: its a different experience, and people travel from different parts of the country to go to a camp in a certain city
[8/15/17, 3:16:20 PM] Scott: so....no one is going to barcelona with me?
[8/15/17, 3:16:27 PM] Steve: But it's just a fucking party while you are camping
[8/15/17, 3:16:36 PM] Kiyoon: No, you missed your chance with Steve
[8/15/17, 3:16:47 PM] Launchpad: i got to see downtown denver
[8/15/17, 3:16:51 PM] Steve: I'd go at some point in the future cheese
[8/15/17, 3:17:00 PM] Steve: Just not in a month
[8/15/17, 3:17:02 PM] Steve: Clearly
[8/15/17, 3:17:22 PM] Miller: yea i dont think it really counts as traveling if you just go to one of these camps in a different city
[8/15/17, 3:17:27 PM] Miller: b/c doesnt matter where you are
[8/15/17, 3:17:36 PM] Miller: might as well be in upstate NY
[8/15/17, 3:17:49 PM] Steve: Or in your backyard in the hamptons
[8/15/17, 3:17:55 PM] Steve: Essentially
[8/15/17, 3:18:03 PM] Steve: I'm not saying you won't have fun LP
[8/15/17, 3:18:04 PM] Miller: ill give you a good deal LP only $500
[8/15/17, 3:18:13 PM] Miller: i can provide all the same amenities
[8/15/17, 3:18:20 PM] Launchpad: maybe -- but you can also plan extra days for your trip
[8/15/17, 3:18:42 PM] Steve: But then that's not just the camping lol
[8/15/17, 3:19:02 PM] Miller: i do think cheese should go to this camp b/c it would be entertaining for us
[8/15/17, 3:21:59 PM] Launchpad: single Cheese should go to a camp by himself
[8/15/17, 3:22:13 PM] Scott: maybe
[8/15/17, 3:22:22 PM] Launchpad: You really have to suck as a person to not have a good time (like the buzzfeed writer)
[8/15/17, 3:22:39 PM] Miller: people are different, different people enjoy different things
[8/15/17, 3:23:13 PM] Justin: Why do you need to use your travel points within a month?
[8/15/17, 3:23:29 PM] Steve: Some people consider a camp traveling
[8/15/17, 3:23:45 PM] Miller: some people dont like being sexually assaulted or seeing people maybe get sexually assaulted
[8/15/17, 3:24:07 PM] Steve: I would assume most don't like either of those
[8/15/17, 3:24:21 PM] Steve: Other than people who are doing the sexual assaulting
[8/15/17, 3:24:31 PM] Steve: I would assume that they don't care
[8/15/17, 3:24:45 PM] Miller: seemed like most ppl didnt care from that buzzfeed article
[8/15/17, 3:25:00 PM] Justin: Impossible. People go to these camps to party and have sex, therefore consent is implied
[8/15/17, 3:25:01 PM] Steve: I honestly didn't even read it
[8/15/17, 3:25:13 PM] Steve: That's not how consent works
[8/15/17, 3:25:27 PM] Steve: Also hope that you never have a child now
[8/15/17, 3:25:43 PM] Justin: Yeh but I mean that's the implication
[8/15/17, 3:26:04 PM] Steve: Still not a thing
[8/15/17, 3:26:32 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 3:26:32 PM] Launchpad: two sides to every story maybe?
[8/15/17, 3:26:44 PM] Launchpad: thats a stupid statement
[8/15/17, 3:26:52 PM] Justin: Knew that was coming
[8/15/17, 3:26:57 PM] Justin: Even added in Party part
[8/15/17, 3:26:58 PM] Launchpad: im sure you're being facetious
[8/15/17, 3:27:00 PM] Launchpad: i hope
[8/15/17, 3:27:12 PM] Steve: I also hope he was
[8/15/17, 3:27:22 PM] Steve: But he probably wasn't since he followed it up
[8/15/17, 3:27:28 PM] Steve: With this
[8/15/17, 3:27:40 PM] Justin: Dead serious. If you go get drunk you clearly are responsible for your actions
[8/15/17, 3:28:11 PM] Steve: So you think a person who is passed out from alcohol that then gets raped is responsible?
[8/15/17, 3:28:15 PM] Brian Katz: That's what we kept telling tommy penzinski
[8/15/17, 3:28:23 PM] Steve: From that last statement, that's basically what you are saying
[8/15/17, 3:28:30 PM] Justin: Alcohol is a sin, sinners se themselves up
[8/15/17, 3:28:48 PM] Steve: Ok so you are trolling like a true miller follower
[8/15/17, 3:29:20 PM] Launchpad: also the writer keeps saying "possible assault" -- guilty until proven innocent?
[8/15/17, 3:29:26 PM] Justin: Well I mean 40% nation does beleive it so can't be all that wrong
[8/15/17, 3:29:47 PM] Steve: 40% of the nation still believes trump is doing a good job
[8/15/17, 3:29:50 PM] Steve: Who cares?
[8/15/17, 3:30:03 PM] Miller: well even a possible assault is a possible reason someone could not enjoy themselves, you said you guaranteed it which seems unreasonable
[8/15/17, 3:30:22 PM] Launchpad: fair
[8/15/17, 3:30:41 PM] Launchpad: Probably 95% of the people there will have an amazing experience
[8/15/17, 3:30:52 PM] Launchpad: from what Ive seen now from the 2 Ive been too
[8/15/17, 3:31:00 PM] Brian Katz: You don't have to be at a camp to get attacked. Look at that hollaway chick.
[8/15/17, 3:31:27 PM] Steve: That is absolutely correct
[8/15/17, 3:31:45 PM] Steve: Shit you could just be going on a run
[8/15/17, 3:32:16 PM] Launchpad: actually.....we had an assaulter....this super creepy gay dude.  He had a nickname -- ADG: Aggressive Dick Grabber
[8/15/17, 3:32:18 PM] Brian Katz: That girl in Brooklyn diem like that this year
[8/15/17, 3:32:24 PM] Launchpad: he either left a day early or got kicked out
[8/15/17, 3:32:36 PM] Brian Katz: Grabbing too many ducks?
[8/15/17, 3:32:40 PM] Brian Katz: Dicks*
[8/15/17, 3:32:44 PM] Miller: im sure, but i also think that probably attracts a certain type of person from the beginning
[8/15/17, 3:32:45 PM] Justin: Damn.
[8/15/17, 3:32:45 PM] Steve: How do you know he was gay?
[8/15/17, 3:32:51 PM] Justin: Must been in grinder withdrawal
[8/15/17, 3:32:51 PM] Steve: And why didn't you notify he police?
[8/15/17, 3:32:55 PM] Miller: like im sure 95% of people who go to the gathering of the juggalos have a great time
[8/15/17, 3:33:12 PM] Launchpad: it was 100% obvious
[8/15/17, 3:33:18 PM] Miller: you smash?
[8/15/17, 3:33:26 PM] Launchpad: he did say he wanted to marry me a few times
[8/15/17, 3:34:16 PM] Launchpad: lol, thats a valid point
[8/15/17, 3:34:27 PM] Launchpad: but I know you guys, thats why I'm insistent
[8/15/17, 3:34:42 PM] Miller: im sure i would have a good time, i just enjoy busting your balls about it
[8/15/17, 3:35:05 PM] Launchpad: lol I figured.  Steve seems like the only person actually against it
[8/15/17, 3:36:05 PM] Justin: did he ask for your number as friends
[8/15/17, 3:36:30 PM] Steve: If I was with you, probably
[8/15/17, 3:36:31 PM] Launchpad: no
[8/15/17, 3:36:37 PM] Steve: Something we agree on
[8/15/17, 4:27:22 PM] Justin: Lol trump is the worst
[8/15/17, 4:27:33 PM] Justin: "What about the alt left" lol
[8/15/17, 4:28:03 PM] Miller: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-15/netflix-co-founder-s-crazy-plan-pay-10-a-month-go-to-the-movies-all-you-want seems like an awesome deal for anyone w/o kids
[8/15/17, 4:28:21 PM] Donk: a couple of my friends used to do it
[8/15/17, 4:28:26 PM] Donk: back when it was 30 a month
[8/15/17, 4:28:34 PM] Donk: its legit
[8/15/17, 4:28:34 PM] Miller: $10/mo is a no brainer
[8/15/17, 4:29:11 PM] Donk: you used to have to sign into the app when you got to the theatre, and then use this credit card they would send you to buy the tickets
[8/15/17, 4:29:26 PM] Donk: seemed like a small pain, but in the end, worth it if you go to 3+ movies a month
[8/15/17, 4:29:50 PM] Justin: Seems like dumb idea
[8/15/17, 4:30:06 PM] Justin: Unless they are locking in yearly subscriptions?
[8/15/17, 4:30:09 PM] Donk: at 30th a month i could see them making money on it if people dont go to the movies but pay for the card
[8/15/17, 4:30:18 PM] Donk: but at 10/month, hard to see how they make money on it
[8/15/17, 4:31:29 PM] Justin: Yeh that seems dumb.  Maybe not though. Let's say there are maybe 30 movies you would want to see in a year?  So at absolute end they really only lose about 20$ a month.
[8/15/17, 4:31:58 PM] Justin: prettylikey most people really only want to see 10-15 movies a year. Which would be break even.
[8/15/17, 4:32:09 PM] Justin: 20$ month probably sweet spot
[8/15/17, 4:32:24 PM] Launchpad: agree
[8/15/17, 4:32:26 PM] Miller: same way they always make money
[8/15/17, 4:32:31 PM] Miller: the popcorn and soda
[8/15/17, 4:32:38 PM] Donk: i would say i go to about 15-20 movies a year, and thats without really trying
[8/15/17, 4:32:41 PM] Miller: its like when i had mets season tixx
[8/15/17, 4:32:46 PM] Miller: the tickets themselves were like $20
[8/15/17, 4:32:51 PM] Justin: Yeh but they are paying full price
[8/15/17, 4:32:52 PM] Miller: but food/beer/parking etc...
[8/15/17, 4:33:09 PM] Justin: They aren't getting a share of revenue from food sales are they?
[8/15/17, 4:33:07 PM] Donk: yeah, but the theatres get that, so now you are talking about the theatres kicking back money to moviepass
[8/15/17, 4:33:14 PM] Launchpad: I can't even remember the last movie I saw in theater -- it was years ago
[8/15/17, 4:33:16 PM] Miller: idk the economics behind it, i would assume so
[8/15/17, 4:33:31 PM] Miller: i think thats the only way this would work
[8/15/17, 4:34:21 PM] Justin: Seems like goal is to take loss there
[8/15/17, 4:34:26 PM] Miller: clicked on the link in that article about their biz model but its behind a paywall so i got nothing
[8/15/17, 4:34:30 PM] Justin: But to collect data on viewing habits
[8/15/17, 4:34:39 PM] Justin: Which presumably can be parlayed into advertising
[8/15/17, 4:34:39 PM] Miller: would be crazy to me if they could make $ like planet fitness
[8/15/17, 4:35:20 PM] Justin: So it's a data mining operation
[8/15/17, 4:43:22 PM] Donk: just listened to it, this fucking guy
[8/15/17, 4:43:33 PM] Donk: i cant believe we have atleast 3.5 years more of this bullshit
[8/15/17, 4:43:49 PM] Donk: he's basically blaming the counter-protesters now
[8/15/17, 4:46:26 PM] Donk: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 4:58:38 PM] Scott: Who is buck?
[8/15/17, 5:01:13 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 5:01:43 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 5:01:43 PM] Scott: Haha
[8/15/17, 5:02:27 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 5:02:40 PM] Justin: i saw that captain america thing before lol
[8/15/17, 5:02:54 PM] Justin: my sci fi libertarain group posted it
[8/15/17, 5:03:34 PM] Miller: if mayweather gets to -400 idk if ill be able to resist
[8/15/17, 5:21:10 PM] Justin: whats mggregor at now?
[8/15/17, 5:24:26 PM] Miller: +450
[8/15/17, 5:24:57 PM] Miller: i dont care if i somehow end up being wrong on this, that is the dumbest bet i have ever seen
[8/15/17, 5:25:56 PM] Donk: itll be so much more entertaining if mcgregor somehow wins
[8/15/17, 5:26:04 PM] Donk: but instead its probably another terribly boring mayweather fight
[8/15/17, 5:28:31 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 5:30:10 PM] Justin: well i guess this mean sbannon isnt getting fired
[8/15/17, 5:30:58 PM] Justin: do you think david duke realizes that he is still identifying himself as a terrorist in his tweet?
[8/15/17, 5:31:28 PM] Justin: by trump logic, i hear it all the time anyway, but david duke was a democrat so all democrats are racists
[8/15/17, 5:31:27 PM] Miller: hes a dr, im sure he realizes that
[8/15/17, 5:31:34 PM] Justin: are terrorists*
[8/15/17, 5:32:22 PM] Miller: i had someone the other day tell me well elizabeth warren used to be a republican
[8/15/17, 5:32:29 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 5:32:35 PM] Miller: wtf does that have to do w/anything
[8/15/17, 5:33:22 PM] Justin: clearly you just dont get it
[8/15/17, 5:34:29 PM] Justin: although for shits and giggles, would like to see when elizabeth warren was a registered republican.
[8/15/17, 5:35:10 PM] Justin: I mean in the David Duke case its a complete bastardication of history....but yeh clearly people can change their minds
[8/15/17, 5:35:17 PM] Miller: i didnt get into it, it was at work meeting and could already tell we had no middle ground on this
[8/15/17, 5:36:04 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/15/17, 5:36:39 PM] Justin: yeh just looked it up
[8/15/17, 5:36:43 PM] Launchpad: flip flopping extremist
[8/15/17, 5:36:55 PM] Justin: i was gonna say considering her educational pedigree of teaching, woudlnt be surprising
[8/15/17, 5:37:21 PM] Miller: nobody flip flops like you @16195657200
[8/15/17, 5:37:27 PM] Miller: 1st you are all team gary johnson
[8/15/17, 5:37:45 PM] Miller: then he sticks his tongue out and has a mild mental breakdown and you go and vote for $killary

[8/15/17, 5:39:26 PM] Justin: I was thinking about the "david duke" story and how much better republicans are at messaging.  90% of racist republicans that know nothing about politics, could tell you david duke a former grandmaster of KKK  was a demcorat....therefore democrats hate black people

[8/15/17, 5:39:58 PM] Miller: wonder if this is what rich jones was referring to?
[8/15/17, 5:40:08 PM] Justin: i cant think of one message the democratic party has that permeates the democratic electorate to that same degree on literally anything
[8/15/17, 5:40:10 PM] Miller: thats doctor duke to you
[8/15/17, 5:40:10 PM] Scott: i wonder if rich jones wrote tha tmeme
[8/15/17, 5:41:58 PM] Miller: (in case anyone is curious why i keep mocking his title)
[8/15/17, 5:41:59 PM] Miller: In September 2005, Duke received a PhD in history[99] from the Ukrainian private university Interregional Academy of Personnel Management (MAUP), an institution that has been described by the Anti-Defamation League as a "University of Hate."[100] Duke's doctoral thesis was titled "Zionism as a Form of Ethnic Supremacism."[99] However, the PhD program of MAUP was not accredited by the Higher Attestation Commission of Ukraine and is not accredited by this state body's successor, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine,[101] so the PhD diplomas issued by MAUP are not recognized by the Ukrainian state as academic degrees.
[8/15/17, 5:42:04 PM] Justin: pretty funny although 6 minutes long

[8/15/17, 5:49:42 PM] Justin: cant even argue 90k is nicer area, looks like weehawken its a shithole
[8/15/17, 6:07:20 PM] Brian Katz: Here's a sick question. If your wife/girlfriend switched bodies with your mother and it could only be reversed if you slept with one of them. Which one do you choose?
[8/15/17, 6:09:07 PM] Donk: Oh god, thats horrible
[8/15/17, 6:10:19 PM] Miller: pretty easy you just render your wife/gf unconcious by your preferred method (alcohol, chloroform, i dont care) then smash
[8/15/17, 6:10:54 PM] Brian Katz: It's kind of like you raped your mom
[8/15/17, 6:11:55 PM] Miller: i mean i dont care if taylor swifts brain gets trapped in my moms body, under no circumstances am i having sex with her
[8/15/17, 6:12:01 PM] Miller: really not an option
[8/15/17, 6:16:32 PM] Brian Katz: Okay let's say the rules are they have to be conscious
[8/15/17, 6:18:07 PM] Donk: Dont switch them back and find a new gf?

[8/16/17, 10:18:22 AM] Donk: its still going to be out for download
[8/16/17, 10:18:28 AM] Miller: FBI will be at your door in 5 min katz

[8/16/17, 12:31:44 PM] Miller: http://vitals.lifehacker.com/eating-clean-won-t-solve-any-of-your-problems-1797873037 @16195657200 try not to get too triggered
[8/16/17, 12:32:00 PM] Miller: you should email them and tell them that you lost weight so therefore their entire article is bullshit
[8/16/17, 12:41:20 PM] Launchpad: Honestly this article is a pointless bunch of pointless rambling devoid of any value
[8/16/17, 12:41:52 PM] Launchpad: I think it all comes down to how you define 'clean'
[8/16/17, 12:43:20 PM] Launchpad: By my own definition, eating 'clean' has had all sorts of incredible positive benefits and if you want to argue that against me that I'd say you're a fucken moron
[8/16/17, 12:45:58 PM] Justin: Well according to this Netflix documentary katz saw, your diet is killing you
[8/16/17, 12:46:59 PM] Launchpad: I have never felt more alive -- so unless we're living bizarro world, I'm going with the very anti-scientific philosophy of "if it makes you feel good, its good for you, if it makes you feel like shit, its bad for you"
[8/16/17, 12:47:19 PM] Miller: just like heroin
[8/16/17, 12:47:24 PM] Launchpad: ** makes you feel good without hangovers and side effects
[8/16/17, 12:47:38 PM] Launchpad: heroin makes you feel good but it also makes you feel like shit, so nice try
[8/16/17, 12:48:40 PM] Donk: is this from experience?
[8/16/17, 12:48:55 PM] Launchpad: heroin or food?
[8/16/17, 12:48:59 PM] Launchpad: I have never done heroin
[8/16/17, 12:49:36 PM] Donk: your feelings on eating clean are based on how you feel
[8/16/17, 12:49:45 PM] Launchpad: yes
[8/16/17, 12:49:53 PM] Launchpad: I have so much more energy when I eat clean
[8/16/17, 12:49:54 PM] Donk: so when you made the heroin statement, once could only assume that you meant it from personal experience as well
[8/16/17, 12:50:53 PM] Justin: You are missing the point here. Meat is killing you and you need a plant based diet.
[8/16/17, 12:52:52 PM] Brian Katz: I'm going to try and cut down on the amount of meat I eat. I agreed that meat with every meal might be excessive, but I don't want to become a vegan. That might have its own set of issues too. A healthy balance is probably best.
[8/16/17, 12:55:11 PM] Donk: meat is also a huge contributing factor to global warming
[8/16/17, 12:55:47 PM] Brian Katz: I don't care about that, I don't want to get a heart attack
[8/16/17, 12:56:28 PM] Brian Katz: I don't think that's true. If you eat lots of meat and cheese, and don't exercise, it probably is
[8/16/17, 12:57:50 PM] Donk: you should care, you live on an island
[8/16/17, 12:59:04 PM] Brian Katz: It's not like it's going to happen over night, or even in my lifetime. Why would I worry about something I can't effect or change?
[8/16/17, 12:59:20 PM] Donk: agreed that it wont happen over night
[8/16/17, 12:59:33 PM] Donk: however, it is already happening, and likely has huge impacts in our lifetime
[8/16/17, 12:59:45 PM] Donk: but yeah, im not giving up meat either
[8/16/17, 12:59:52 PM] Donk: but it is a huge problem with meat production
[8/16/17, 12:59:53 PM] Brian Katz: Okay Dink so what can I do?
[8/16/17, 1:00:07 PM] Donk: ha, i dont know
[8/16/17, 1:00:16 PM] Donk: its something that we all need to do together
[8/16/17, 1:00:25 PM] Brian Katz: Okay, so why worry about it?
[8/16/17, 1:00:42 PM] Brian Katz: And when the smartest people figure that out count me in.
[8/16/17, 1:01:28 PM] Donk: we did take good steps in signing the paris agreement.....oh wait
[8/16/17, 1:03:08 PM] Brian Katz: I'm focused on the NFL fantasy season right now. And Game of thrones season 7
[8/16/17, 1:03:34 PM] Brian Katz: If I can help global warming g while incorporating those two things just tell me.
[8/16/17, 1:04:41 PM] Brian Katz: I found out why the game of thrones episode leaked. Apparently hbo go in Spain accidentally posted them up 4 days early lol
[8/16/17, 1:05:06 PM] Miller: @15165329107 leaked it
[8/16/17, 1:16:43 PM] Miller: you arent quitting! i am disbanding the council!
[8/16/17, 1:17:38 PM] Donk: such a clown
[8/16/17, 1:18:54 PM] Miller: if he got impeached you know it would be "rather than putting this pressure on myself to #MAGA i have decided to resign as president despite everyone begging me to stay"
[8/16/17, 1:19:56 PM] Launchpad: I agree that reducing the amount of meat we eat would be beneficial.  I think we aught to de-glamourize the 'meat orgy' mentality our society has and save it for special occasions like the Austin trip
[8/16/17, 1:20:35 PM] Launchpad: but for me, I think its cutting meat out of a meal here and there, and eating better quality meats.  I'm not about to go vegetarian
[8/16/17, 1:21:57 PM] Miller: or by we did you mean everyone else?
[8/16/17, 1:22:28 PM] Launchpad: that was a special occasion and a high quality steak üòÇ
[8/16/17, 1:22:48 PM] Miller: does look pretty good
[8/16/17, 1:22:51 PM] Launchpad: I mean with the everyday obsession Mills -- I'm not preaching
[8/16/17, 1:23:01 PM] Miller: if its making me hungry it counts as glamouirizing though
[8/16/17, 1:23:09 PM] Launchpad: I'm just saying it would be a little more sensible if we weren't so obsessed
[8/16/17, 1:24:19 PM] Donk: did you golf at torrey pines too?
[8/16/17, 1:24:21 PM] Donk: or just eat?
[8/16/17, 1:24:32 PM] Donk: supposed to be a fantastic course
[8/16/17, 1:26:09 PM] Launchpad: Not that day. I played it once with Goldberg.   We played the easier North course,  not the one where the pros play
[8/16/17, 1:28:47 PM] Justin: There has been an increase in heart disease along side a decrease In overall red meat consumption.
[8/16/17, 1:29:09 PM] Justin: But hey that's science, why listen to that.
[8/16/17, 1:31:14 PM] Launchpad: is that science or two uncorrelated facts???
[8/16/17, 1:31:22 PM] Justin: Much of red meat connection is hysteria and misconception of fat
[8/16/17, 1:31:32 PM] Justin: Well it's a clear correlation
[8/16/17, 1:31:51 PM] Justin: You are correct however  clearly sugar and dairy can cause heart disease as well
[8/16/17, 1:32:15 PM] Justin: So it does t answer the question: what doesn't cause heart disease ?
[8/16/17, 1:32:43 PM] Justin: Adam ruined this a couple weeks ago
[8/16/17, 1:33:54 PM] Justin: Lol yes. Saying meat causes heart disease and than disregarding how heart disease has progressed alongside diets deempasizing red meat, is just like that Nicolas cage thing
[8/16/17, 1:34:09 PM] Launchpad: The quality of the meat matters.  If its pumped full of hormones and steroids, its probably not as good if it isn't
[8/16/17, 1:34:23 PM] Launchpad: lol
[8/16/17, 1:34:24 PM] Justin: Lol no it doesn't.
[8/16/17, 1:34:42 PM] Justin: Were they pumping meets full of said steroids when this idea began in early 20th century?
[8/16/17, 1:35:07 PM] Justin: But nice scapegoat. Fits the story being told by gurus
[8/16/17, 1:35:19 PM] Launchpad: Steriods in humans -> Bad.  Give steriods to animals than eat those animals  ->  Good?
[8/16/17, 1:35:24 PM] Launchpad: doesn't pass the common sense test
[8/16/17, 1:35:32 PM] Justin: That's another story
[8/16/17, 1:35:38 PM] Launchpad: its just a way to scam the rich of course
[8/16/17, 1:35:45 PM] Launchpad: by making them by more expensive food
[8/16/17, 1:35:47 PM] Justin: You can't claim that they are the cause of heart disease though
[8/16/17, 1:35:54 PM] Justin: Because he claim itself predates those steroids
[8/16/17, 1:36:19 PM] Launchpad: I didn't make that claim
[8/16/17, 1:36:34 PM] Donk: almost 800 people a year die in tangled bed sheet accidents?
[8/16/17, 1:36:35 PM] Donk: wtf?
[8/16/17, 1:36:48 PM] Justin: You said the quality matters
[8/16/17, 1:37:16 PM] Launchpad: I am saying common sense would lead me to believe if given the choice between the two, I would go with the meat not pumped full of steriods and hormones, but hey, you do you
[8/16/17, 1:37:29 PM] Justin: That's fine.
[8/16/17, 1:37:35 PM] Justin: Not again I disagree w that
[8/16/17, 1:37:39 PM] Launchpad: Quality matters != cause of heart disease
[8/16/17, 1:37:50 PM] Justin: Not sure where science stands but I agree
[8/16/17, 1:38:26 PM] Justin: Well interesting thing to say in response to my meat causes heart disease hysteria
[8/16/17, 1:38:49 PM] Justin: CArbs probably much more Likey to cause heart disease
[8/16/17, 1:38:52 PM] Launchpad: Not sure where science stands but I see the kind of people eating fast food and I can't say they look healthier than those eating at Tender Greens
[8/16/17, 1:39:14 PM] Justin: But that's a sample size bias.
[8/16/17, 1:39:38 PM] Justin: Obviously with all shitty food on fast food menu, those people will be more unhealthy
[8/16/17, 1:39:45 PM] Launchpad: when in doubt - I trust my own body
[8/16/17, 1:40:31 PM] Justin: You do you.
[8/16/17, 1:41:04 PM] Justin: I'm just saying eating a diet wth fat, isn't the devil.
[8/16/17, 1:41:15 PM] Launchpad: I never said it was either
[8/16/17, 1:41:26 PM] Justin: In fact it's a large reason why we have such a shitty overall diet problem in America
[8/16/17, 1:41:38 PM] Justin: We deemphasized meats and fats and emphasized potato chips
[8/16/17, 1:41:54 PM] Launchpad: in fact Slow Carb & Keto diets emphasis high fat (good quality fats)
[8/16/17, 1:42:04 PM] Justin: And now we have high diabetes, cancer and heart disease levels.
[8/16/17, 1:42:24 PM] Justin: I'm not making this about your diet.
[8/16/17, 1:42:50 PM] Justin: Never claimed your diet was unhealthy, claimed quite the opposite
[8/16/17, 1:43:42 PM] Justin: I'm talking about the overall demonization of meat, mostly done by research from he sugar industry on correlation of fat and heart disease
[8/16/17, 1:44:48 PM] Justin: https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html
[8/16/17, 1:44:55 PM] Brian Katz: It's crazy all of you are making different points backed by scientific data that contradict each other. Just eat anything in moderation and you should be okay I think
[8/16/17, 1:45:49 PM] Launchpad: Or -- be self aware about your own body....many people lack this
[8/16/17, 1:46:30 PM] Justin: Yeh most people can't feel cancer growing in their body, shameful
[8/16/17, 1:47:57 PM] Justin: Katz can verify that "knowing your body" is the same thing the vegans say in that documentary.
[8/16/17, 1:48:13 PM] Justin: It's an overgeneralization that has nearly nothing to do with reality.
[8/16/17, 1:48:17 PM] Launchpad: I didn't say people are immune from disease...I said trust your body
[8/16/17, 1:48:32 PM] Launchpad: if you don't trust your own body and you lack that awareness, I don't know what to tell you
[8/16/17, 1:48:38 PM] Justin: Things can be objectively healthy
[8/16/17, 1:48:51 PM] Justin: Ala paleo, is pretty objectively healthy
[8/16/17, 1:50:16 PM] Justin: But katz is right, moderation
[8/16/17, 1:51:02 PM] Miller: e
[8/16/17, 1:51:05 PM] Miller: except heroin
[8/16/17, 1:51:06 PM] Miller: supposedly

t was a strange moment of triumph against racism: The gun-slinging white supremacist Craig Cobb, dressed up for daytime TV in a dark suit and red tie, hearing that his DNA testing revealed his ancestry to be only ‚Äú86 percent European, and ‚Ä¶ 14 percent Sub-Saharan African.‚Äù The studio audience whooped and laughed and cheered. And Cobb ‚Äî who was, in 2013, charged with terrorizing people while trying to create an all-white enclave in North Dakota ‚Äî reacted like a sore loser in the schoolyard.

‚ÄúWait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, just wait a minute,‚Äù he said, trying to put on an all-knowing smile. ‚ÄúThis is called statistical noise.‚Äù
[8/16/17, 5:19:36 PM] Miller: Someone already did this
[8/16/17, 5:19:46 PM] Miller: Maury maybe?
[8/16/17, 5:32:34 PM] Scott: dunno

[8/17/17, 10:31:11 AM] Donk: canadian bacon is delicous
[8/17/17, 10:31:18 AM] Steve: It's the worst
[8/17/17, 10:31:20 AM] Steve: Dry
[8/17/17, 10:31:20 AM] Donk: however, its more canadian ham than bacon
[8/17/17, 10:31:25 AM] Steve: Not bacon tasting
[8/17/17, 10:31:38 AM] Donk: i agree that it shoudlnt be called bacon
[8/17/17, 10:31:38 AM] Steve: It's pretty much the worst bacon you can have
[8/17/17, 10:31:44 AM] Miller: its just ham
[8/17/17, 10:31:45 AM] Miller: but its fine
[8/17/17, 10:31:52 AM] Donk: do you like spiral ham steve?
[8/17/17, 10:31:56 AM] Donk: or do you find that dry as well?
[8/17/17, 10:32:01 AM] Steve: Not a fan of ham
[8/17/17, 10:32:04 AM] Steve: In general
[8/17/17, 10:32:06 AM] Steve: Would eat it
[8/17/17, 10:32:21 AM] Miller: i do remember when you ordered canadian bacon somewhere and were very dissapointed
[8/17/17, 10:32:23 AM] Miller: mikes diner maybe?
[8/17/17, 10:32:26 AM] Steve: Wouldn't eat it
[8/17/17, 10:32:35 AM] Steve: No, diner by you in bethpage
[8/17/17, 10:32:41 AM] Miller: some diner
[8/17/17, 10:32:41 AM] Steve: One of the worst diner experiences ever
[8/17/17, 10:32:53 AM] Miller: was a learning experience
[8/17/17, 10:32:57 AM] Miller: bacon = good
[8/17/17, 10:32:59 AM] Miller: canadian bacon = ham
[8/17/17, 10:33:37 AM] Steve: Just too dry
[8/17/17, 10:33:40 AM] Steve: Hate dry meat
[8/17/17, 10:33:44 AM] Steve: Except for jerky
[8/17/17, 10:33:56 AM] Scott: I remember when Steve ordered a plate of bacon from mikes diner. Must have been 30 strips or so took down the whole thing
[8/17/17, 10:34:00 AM] Scott: Didn't even hesitate
[8/17/17, 10:34:02 AM] Donk: i think you may have just had bad canadian bacon
[8/17/17, 10:34:24 AM] Donk: because it shouldnt be as dry as you seem to have experienced
[8/17/17, 10:34:27 AM] Miller: i mean if you dont like ham, you are probably not going to like canadian bacon
[8/17/17, 10:34:35 AM] Donk: also true
[8/17/17, 10:37:45 AM] Brian Katz: Canadian bacon is bomb
[8/17/17, 10:37:53 AM] Sean: Canadian bacon is fucking terrible
[8/17/17, 10:38:04 AM] Steve: Sean has spoken
[8/17/17, 10:38:13 AM] Steve: And agreed
[8/17/17, 10:38:53 AM] Miller: cmon we gotta get at least one canadian bacon related rage quitr
[8/17/17, 10:39:52 AM] Donk: must be a spanish thing
[8/17/17, 10:40:00 AM] Brian Katz: Mate
[8/17/17, 10:40:04 AM] Brian Katz: Maybe*
[8/17/17, 10:40:20 AM] Miller: thought katz was becoming australian there for a second
[8/17/17, 10:42:01 AM] Brian Katz: Lol good day mate, let's put another shrimp on the Barbie
[8/17/17, 10:56:09 AM] Steve: It's not a Spanish thing
[8/17/17, 10:56:18 AM] Steve: It's a Canadian bacon isn't bacon thing
[8/17/17, 10:56:36 AM] Steve: It's like ordering French fries and getting a baked potato
[8/17/17, 10:56:49 AM] Donk: or ordering french fries and getting tater tots
[8/17/17, 10:57:07 AM] Miller: which would be fine, b/c those are french fries
[8/17/17, 10:58:03 AM] Steve: Tater tots are better fries than Canadian bacon is bacon
[8/17/17, 10:58:26 AM] Steve: We can all agree on that
[8/17/17, 10:59:16 AM] Donk: i think most of us would agree that tater tots are in no way fries
[8/17/17, 10:59:33 AM] Miller: if i ordered bacon id rather receive tater tots than canadian bacon
[8/17/17, 10:59:45 AM] Steve: Boom
[8/17/17, 10:59:55 AM] Steve: I'll take that for the win
[8/17/17, 11:50:57 AM] Miller: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/17/van-ploughs-crowd-barcelona1/ stay safe
[8/17/17, 12:04:00 PM] Justin: Shocking terrorism is used within seconds of that one.
[8/17/17, 12:05:02 PM] Miller: cant wait for the gun morons to sarcastically talk about banning cars
[8/17/17, 12:16:41 PM] Miller: Wait @16195657200 this camp already happened? I thought it was this upcoming weekend
[8/17/17, 12:16:42 PM] Miller: No stories? Cmon
[8/17/17, 12:17:31 PM] Launchpad: sorry my stories were replaced with arguments about what constitutes as travel
[8/17/17, 12:18:21 PM] Donk: its the same thing that has happened to canadian bacon, tater tots and baked potatoes. they got steve'd
[8/17/17, 12:18:29 PM] Launchpad: lol
[8/17/17, 12:19:42 PM] Launchpad: I had no cell service for 3 days
[8/17/17, 1:07:02 PM] Steve: I mean, Canadian bacon still sucks
[8/17/17, 1:59:24 PM] Miller: so no stories
[8/17/17, 1:59:24 PM] Miller: lame
[8/17/17, 2:01:34 PM] Scott: LAME
[8/17/17, 2:01:43 PM] Scott: seemns not worth it for me...
[8/17/17, 2:02:45 PM] Miller: on the plus side no stories of people driving vans into campers
[8/17/17, 2:09:26 PM] Launchpad: We did have a Color War though
[8/17/17, 2:25:02 PM] Scott: Cool?
[8/17/17, 4:09:46 PM] Donk: Trump calling for us to commit war crimes now
[8/17/17, 4:09:51 PM] Donk: yay?
[8/17/17, 4:17:53 PM] Justin: Gonna side with trump on this one.  IDK if those words are worse than the actual action of being awarded the nobel peace prize while torturing innocent muslims in secret prisons
[8/17/17, 4:25:10 PM] Donk: Really?
[8/17/17, 4:26:10 PM] Donk: the whole pershing dipped bullets in pigs blood thing didnt happen
[8/17/17, 4:26:23 PM] Donk: and also there was still plenty of violence int he region afterwards
[8/17/17, 4:26:25 PM] Justin: yeh i mean Trump is a deplorable piece of shit, but to pretend like his words carry more meaning than the actual atrocities we are doing behind closed doors, is disingenuous.
[8/17/17, 4:26:32 PM] Justin: and i get he made up the story
[8/17/17, 4:26:35 PM] Donk: and he is also calling for mass killings without due process
[8/17/17, 4:27:08 PM] Justin: not fact checking him....just saying- him tlaking abotu war crimes isnt a bigger story than a democratic all around loved president actually committing them
[8/17/17, 4:26:58 PM] Donk: so i dont know how you would side with trump at all on this one
[8/17/17, 4:27:16 PM] Miller: did linda sarsour weigh in?
[8/17/17, 4:27:32 PM] Justin: it just seems disingenuous
[8/17/17, 4:27:34 PM] Donk: so trump saying we should commit war crimes is fine because war crimes were commited int he past?
[8/17/17, 4:27:56 PM] Justin: no im saying, we have and always will commit war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:28:11 PM] Justin: the fact that he is dumb enough to openly say it, doesnt make it a newsstory
[8/17/17, 4:28:36 PM] Justin: luckily he may in fact be to dumb to actually do it without confessing so there may be some chance in the end we get less war crimes from him
[8/17/17, 4:28:56 PM] Justin: not that accountability has ever stopped him form doing anything illegal to date
[8/17/17, 4:29:15 PM] Justin: the newsstory was when Obama did it
[8/17/17, 4:29:36 PM] Justin: if Obama is doing it and we allow it, what the fuck do we expect a prick like Trump to do?
[8/17/17, 4:29:58 PM] Donk: so basically you are saying "Thanks obama?"
[8/17/17, 4:30:01 PM] Justin: Trump ran on a campaign promise of i will kill families of terrorists-war crime
[8/17/17, 4:30:08 PM] Donk: come on herman, you are basically condoning war crimes here
[8/17/17, 4:30:10 PM] Justin: im saying its sensationalized
[8/17/17, 4:30:16 PM] Justin: im not at all
[8/17/17, 4:30:20 PM] Justin: im saying the coverage isnt to stop war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:30:26 PM] Justin: its to talk about dumb shit trump says
[8/17/17, 4:30:51 PM] Justin: by all means we should condemn and point out war crimes at every step, but the relaity is the MSM doesn't do that
[8/17/17, 4:31:24 PM] Justin: so to pretend like highlighting Trump talking about war crimes is a serious thing, when in fact we condone war crimes every day, seems silly
[8/17/17, 4:34:25 PM] Justin: the Obama administrtaion murdered a us citizen, than murdered his son, than the Trump administration murdered his daughter.  The silence echoed throughout the committing of these actual war crimes.
[8/17/17, 4:35:52 PM] Donk: thats ridiculous
[8/17/17, 4:36:05 PM] Donk: you are basically saying we cant talk about one thing because we dont talk about the other
[8/17/17, 4:36:15 PM] Donk: do i think both should be talked about? yes
[8/17/17, 4:36:23 PM] Justin: im talkign about what is the story
[8/17/17, 4:36:30 PM] Justin: what is offensive
[8/17/17, 4:36:34 PM] Donk: the story is that today, trump called for war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:36:51 PM] Justin: did he commit them?
[8/17/17, 4:36:50 PM] Donk: if you dont think thats offensive coming from the president of the us, then i dont know what is
[8/17/17, 4:37:10 PM] Donk: ok, so if he came out and said "Kill all Jews"
[8/17/17, 4:37:15 PM] Justin: likely he already did when he killed this girl
[8/17/17, 4:37:15 PM] Justin: http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/31/politics/yemen-raid-daughter-al-qaeda-leader/index.html
[8/17/17, 4:37:17 PM] Donk: is that not a story because he didnt kill them yet?
[8/17/17, 4:37:27 PM] Justin: im saying he already committed war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:37:33 PM] Justin: we said and did nothing
[8/17/17, 4:37:41 PM] Justin: but now that he tlaks about commiting war crimes, its offensice?
[8/17/17, 4:37:44 PM] Justin: seems backwards
[8/17/17, 4:38:08 PM] Donk: well clearly there is an article written about it, by the so called MSM, so someone was talking about it
[8/17/17, 4:38:22 PM] Justin: yeh, its menitoned
[8/17/17, 4:38:33 PM] Justin: lots of things are mentioned, im sure there are several articles
[8/17/17, 4:38:42 PM] Justin: there was almost a committee on it even
[8/17/17, 4:39:27 PM] Justin: but thats because a seal died.  Not becuase 18 women and children were murdered and one of them may have been a US citizen
[8/17/17, 4:39:46 PM] Justin: that part is somehow treated as legal use of force....thanks to Obama once again
[8/17/17, 4:40:08 PM] Justin: so sorry if im not outraged when an idiot of a president comes on blabbering about war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:40:27 PM] Justin: im sure his generals have and are contiually committing them on a daily basis
[8/17/17, 4:41:16 PM] Justin: if this leads to a policy of war crimes, maybe hes dumb enough that something can actualyl be done about it
[8/17/17, 4:41:35 PM] Donk: what are you calling a war crime here?
[8/17/17, 4:41:46 PM] Donk: a raid to kill terrorist leaders that resulted in civilian casualties?
[8/17/17, 4:41:49 PM] Justin: in the yemen raid?
[8/17/17, 4:42:23 PM] Justin: well it would be extra judicial killing of an american girl
[8/17/17, 4:42:43 PM] Donk: she was a civilian casulty of the raid?
[8/17/17, 4:42:52 PM] Justin: under Obama, it would be the killing of her brother and father
[8/17/17, 4:42:57 PM] Donk: thats far different from calling for mass killings outside of dues process
[8/17/17, 4:43:21 PM] Justin: "The memo concluded, "We do not believe that al-Awlaki's U.S. citizenship imposes constitutional limitations that would preclude the contemplated lethal action" by the U.S. military or the CIA."
[8/17/17, 4:43:58 PM] Donk: ok, well regardless, that is very is different for what trump basicallyu just called for
[8/17/17, 4:44:10 PM] Justin: but thats my point
[8/17/17, 4:44:18 PM] Justin: he extrajudicially killed an american citizen
[8/17/17, 4:44:29 PM] Justin: almost no outrage
[8/17/17, 4:44:36 PM] Donk: thats a ridiculous way to state what happened
[8/17/17, 4:44:38 PM] Justin: he calls for bullets to be covered in pig blood.....oh the inhumanity
[8/17/17, 4:45:02 PM] Donk: oh, i dont care about that part, its more the mass killing part
[8/17/17, 4:45:20 PM] Justin: mas killing of?
[8/17/17, 4:45:45 PM] Donk: a group of prisoners
[8/17/17, 4:45:52 PM] Justin: he told a story about how might makes right, that his asshole voters will love
[8/17/17, 4:46:04 PM] Justin: its a fictional story
[8/17/17, 4:46:03 PM] Donk: im sure they will
[8/17/17, 4:46:18 PM] Justin: but they will eat it up...i mena thats trump in  nutshell
[8/17/17, 4:46:50 PM] Justin: meanwhile when he actually violates the constitution as well as liekly commits warcrimes, silence ensues
[8/17/17, 4:46:56 PM] Justin: just seems like a pattern
[8/17/17, 4:47:50 PM] Donk: i still dont understand your point here
[8/17/17, 4:49:58 PM] Justin: my point is the outrage on facebook, you arent as much include in this, will be tremendous.  Will we have a further discussion in MSM about our historic use of war crimes? about secret prisons? about unauthorized dorne strikes in soverign nations?
[8/17/17, 4:50:27 PM] Justin: or will it all be look at big bad trump, what a terrible humna being he is, who could dare condone war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:51:00 PM] Justin: it just seems ludicrous to me, to yell at trump for tlaking about war crimes, when we have and will continue to ignore war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:51:43 PM] Justin: summary: id much prefer him talk about it, that actually conduct them in secret.
[8/17/17, 4:52:01 PM] Donk: i think its ridiculous that you wouldnt want people to be upset about the president publically calling for war crimes because war crimes have been commited in the past
[8/17/17, 4:52:32 PM] Justin: i mean hell say something else within 24 hours
[8/17/17, 4:52:36 PM] Justin: and well forget about this
[8/17/17, 4:52:42 PM] Justin: fuck amybe within 12 hours
[8/17/17, 4:52:55 PM] Donk: i would think that most people wouldnt want war crimes to be commited, so any light shined on them would be a step forward vs no one talkign about them at all
[8/17/17, 4:53:01 PM] Justin: so lets stick to things that seperate him form other presidents
[8/17/17, 4:53:07 PM] Justin: like supporting white nationalists
[8/17/17, 4:53:40 PM] Justin: but if that was the case, whywould their be outrage over what he said?
[8/17/17, 4:54:03 PM] Justin: as in, if people actually knew wtf the US was doing with its military abroad, they wouldnt be shocked that someone would dare talk about war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:54:35 PM] Justin: tlaking about war crimes isnt offensive
[8/17/17, 4:54:39 PM] Justin: committing war crimes is
[8/17/17, 4:54:59 PM] Justin: so perhaps you are right and there is a 1/1000000 this leads to a discussion about war crimes
[8/17/17, 4:55:05 PM] Justin: i doubt that very much
[8/17/17, 4:55:14 PM] Miller: ppl were very offended when linda sarsour was talking about committing crimes
[8/17/17, 4:55:25 PM] Justin: it sjust another way to point at trump and call hima  terrible human being, which he is
[8/17/17, 4:55:39 PM] Justin: but once again that makes many poltiicans terrible human beings and we will not talk about that
[8/17/17, 4:56:03 PM] Justin: wonder where @17189742074 stand son this debate
[8/17/17, 5:01:12 PM] Justin: this discussion reminds me of quote i heard the pother day from che guverra..." if i asked the american left to form a firing line, they would line up in a circle"
[8/17/17, 5:01:17 PM] Justin: to that end i apology donk
[8/17/17, 5:02:02 PM] Justin: we both agree war crimes are a terrible things, and trump is an asshole
[8/17/17, 5:02:50 PM] Donk: no need for an apology, just a healthy debate
[8/17/17, 5:02:56 PM] Donk: but yes, war crimes bad, trump sucks
[8/17/17, 5:02:59 PM] Miller: 13 dead in barcelona? jesus
[8/17/17, 5:03:13 PM] Donk: cheese needs to new travel plans
[8/17/17, 5:03:31 PM] Miller: seriously i think lame no-story summer camp is still better than getting run over
[8/17/17, 5:03:53 PM] Justin: or cheese just got super discount on hotels and travel?
[8/17/17, 5:04:07 PM] Donk: it did seem that there were many more stories about last years summer camp
[8/17/17, 5:04:18 PM] Donk: this year the only story was that there was a color war
[8/17/17, 5:04:20 PM] Donk: pretty lame
[8/17/17, 5:04:21 PM] Miller: he was already paying $19 a night to sleep in a closet w/no AC how much cheaper can it get?
[8/17/17, 5:06:02 PM] Donk: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/17/17, 5:06:21 PM] Steve: 50 injured
[8/17/17, 5:06:36 PM] Donk: yeah, its terrible
[8/17/17, 5:06:49 PM] Donk: these car attacks are nearly impossible to stop
[8/17/17, 5:07:00 PM] Donk: the only answer is to never gather in groups in public places?
[8/17/17, 5:07:39 PM] Miller: or make all cars autonomus
[8/17/17, 5:09:13 PM] Brian Katz: Skynet it's happing
[8/17/17, 5:09:46 PM] Steve: Also put those polls in the cement
[8/17/17, 5:09:53 PM] Steve: Awful I don't know the names
[8/17/17, 5:10:09 PM] Steve: But in densely populated areas those would help stop vehicles
[8/17/17, 5:10:40 PM] Steve: Las ramblas in Barcelona isn't really a gathering zone
[8/17/17, 6:49:25 PM] Scott: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/17/17, 6:54:23 PM] Miller: No who is that
[8/17/17, 6:54:37 PM] Scott: 06 heat
[8/17/17, 6:54:52 PM] Scott: I didn't realize they had white chocolate
[8/17/17, 6:55:04 PM] Scott: Completely forgot
[8/17/17, 7:21:26 PM] Launchpad: How can I have stories? I literally didn't even travel. It was just a party
[8/17/17, 7:21:50 PM] Launchpad: Actually I've been so fucked up and hungover that I just haven't been active so much
[8/17/17, 7:22:21 PM] Launchpad: but I do have a funny story -- I just banged a chick while working from home
[8/17/17, 7:22:32 PM] Justin: is that bruce springstein?
[8/17/17, 7:22:37 PM] Miller: Lol
[8/17/17, 7:22:39 PM] Launchpad: I went on 1 date with like a week before Denver
[8/17/17, 7:23:16 PM] Justin: id go with that or the new guy on RHW of some palce
[8/17/17, 7:23:41 PM] Launchpad: and she texted me that she was at this coffee shop in my neighborhood.  I said I was working from home. She said I should work from there
[8/17/17, 7:23:52 PM] Miller: Someone will know
[8/17/17, 7:23:58 PM] Launchpad: and I told her (which is actually true) that i need to VPN from my home network, come over
[8/17/17, 7:24:26 PM] Launchpad: then we banged. The End
[8/17/17, 7:25:59 PM] Justin: damn all that detail, must been really unispiring performance
[8/17/17, 7:26:21 PM] Launchpad: its only interesting cause it was the first time. otherwise it wouldn't really matter
[8/17/17, 7:27:36 PM] Launchpad: ok funny story from camp -- nothing scandalous yet, but it got me a reputation before camp even started
[8/17/17, 7:29:35 PM] Launchpad: Meetup for the shuttle bus at 5. Bus leaves at 6. I get there, get checked in, and leave my bags with everyone elses by the curb. Go to 7-11 with some other people and get supplies. They said come back by 5:45 to load the bus and get on.  Still plenty of time.  I go to a Mexican restaurant across the street and they take forever to make a quesadilla
[8/17/17, 7:29:46 PM] Scott: üî•üî•üî•
[8/17/17, 7:30:58 PM] Launchpad: I finally get it and head back over to the bus and its 5:45.  The bus is almost completely loaded, and I don't see my stuff anywhere, so I assume someone packed it and put it in already, so I get on the bus
[8/17/17, 7:31:37 PM] Launchpad: 10 minutes later, one of the non-counselors says "Who's stuff is out there?"  Obviously I don't need to look, but I do - and its just my 2 sad bags sitting by themselves in the middle of the sidewalk
[8/17/17, 7:31:50 PM] Launchpad: So I had to do the walk of shame to retrieve them
[8/17/17, 7:32:22 PM] Miller: Aren't you all non counselors?
[8/17/17, 7:32:35 PM] Launchpad: we hadn't even left the curb, and I've already become 'that guy'
[8/17/17, 7:32:48 PM] Launchpad: no we're campers, the non-counselors are the workers
[8/17/17, 7:33:41 PM] James  L: John Franco is that guy
[8/17/17, 7:34:30 PM] Launchpad: you want the details of my fucking?

[8/17/17, 7:35:34 PM] Miller: Slumming it
[8/17/17, 7:35:47 PM] James  L: Hahah
[8/17/17, 7:36:08 PM] Justin: ask katz about franco
[8/17/17, 7:36:09 PM] Miller: I'm at this citi box, it's pretty ridiculous
[8/17/17, 7:36:39 PM] Justin: thank the organiztion for giving the ynakees +4 in win column
[8/17/17, 7:36:53 PM] Justin: much appreciated
[8/17/17, 7:38:52 PM] Miller: Too bad you only have 4 games
[8/17/17, 7:42:20 PM] Justin: seriously, people trying to talk about getting rid of the series
[8/17/17, 7:42:21 PM] Justin: fuck that
[8/17/17, 7:48:45 PM] Launchpad: gents....someone just sent some pics they took of me
[8/17/17, 7:49:04 PM] Launchpad: I was unaware this one existed....might be my new favorite
[8/17/17, 8:04:31 PM] Dan Watts: Pussybutt hand?
[8/17/17, 8:06:48 PM] Launchpad: nah
[8/17/17, 8:12:13 PM] Kiyoon: Is she laughing at it?
[8/17/17, 8:12:50 PM] Launchpad: no she wants it in her mouth, clearly
[8/17/17, 8:16:41 PM] Justin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mAJU_ZKhEM&list=RD3mAJU_ZKhEM&t=52
[8/17/17, 8:18:28 PM] Scott: Woe
[8/17/17, 8:18:29 PM] Scott: Wow
[8/17/17, 8:19:15 PM] Miller: Wow indeed
[8/17/17, 10:45:59 PM] Brian Katz: So where did you go from there lol
[8/17/17, 10:54:15 PM] Justin: actually a perfect poker term for that
[8/17/17, 10:54:18 PM] Justin: http://poker.wikia.com/wiki/Fancy_play_syndrome
[8/18/17, 6:38:27 AM] Scott: Crazy
[8/18/17, 9:12:30 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/18/17, 11:23:27 AM] Miller: SA:  [White House officials expect Steve Bannon to be fired-- Axios]
[8/18/17, 11:24:16 AM] Launchpad: forget building a wall, Trump aught to build a revolving door at 1600
[8/18/17, 11:44:47 AM] Launchpad: http://imgur.com/a/Bn8Yk
[8/18/17, 11:45:18 AM] Launchpad: ^^^ I feel like this is a @16318489683 post for sure
[8/18/17, 12:46:33 PM] Miller: Aides Caution Trump Could Reverse Course, Keep Bannon: NYT
[8/18/17, 12:48:44 PM] Justin: Lol
[8/18/17, 12:49:02 PM] Justin: I mean banning ckearly whispering in his ear on this whole alt left thing
[8/18/17, 12:49:44 PM] Launchpad: Fox News: Trump Could Reverse AIDS
[8/18/17, 12:51:23 PM] Justin: That would alienate viewers, God gave aids to the blacks and the gays.
[8/18/17, 12:51:42 PM] Launchpad: lol
[8/18/17, 1:04:03 PM] Miller: BREAKING: Stephen Bannon has been fired from his White House post - person familiar with the decision
[8/18/17, 1:09:19 PM] Kiyoon: yeah its all over cnn
[8/18/17, 2:49:12 PM] Launchpad: I think hes 45 maybe? One of oldest - not many over 40.  Cool dude though
[8/18/17, 2:50:28 PM] Miller: like staring into your future
[8/18/17, 2:50:50 PM] Launchpad: if thats my future I can't complain
[8/18/17, 2:51:16 PM] Launchpad: he has kids
[8/18/17, 2:51:29 PM] Launchpad: actually....I don't know bout that future
[8/18/17, 2:57:07 PM] Launchpad: https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/teen-bitcoin-millionaire-erik-finman-is-launching-taylor-swifts-1989-into-space/  @15166335046 probably has mixed feelings about this
[8/18/17, 3:08:53 PM] Miller: why?
[8/18/17, 3:11:05 PM] Launchpad: TSwift in space
[8/18/17, 3:11:08 PM] Launchpad: funded by bitcoin
[8/18/17, 3:11:31 PM] Justin: So much for investments only work for intelligent investors
[8/18/17, 3:12:07 PM] Launchpad: investments work for anyone who has the foresight to see its future
[8/18/17, 3:12:18 PM] Justin: Lol not what I meant
[8/18/17, 3:12:34 PM] Justin: More the I want to see how many bitcoin millionaires go broke like lotto winners
[8/18/17, 3:12:41 PM] Launchpad: it works for anyone willing to participate instead of cursing the 1%
[8/18/17, 3:12:49 PM] Justin: Well ha e to wait ten years for the study
[8/18/17, 3:13:17 PM] Justin: Yeh investing in bitcoin and making 10000x your investment is not like winning the lotto at all
[8/18/17, 3:13:49 PM] Launchpad: maybe its just Math??
[8/18/17, 3:14:18 PM] Justin: I mean you are correct they are one step ahead in that they were investing. But then again I think if you polled 90% of financial advisors they would probably have told you not to invest in bitcoin (yes I made that stat up)
[8/18/17, 3:14:21 PM] Launchpad: 21 million bitcoins.....global economy worth trillions.... ü§î
[8/18/17, 3:14:53 PM] Justin: So prete dig like betting on penny stocks is long term investment is slightly disingenuous
[8/18/17, 3:15:10 PM] Launchpad: 1) Having a title of financial advisor doesn't make you rich
2) They don't understand the underlying technology
[8/18/17, 3:15:12 PM] Justin: It is in fact closer to betting
[8/18/17, 3:15:20 PM] Justin: That's fair.
[8/18/17, 3:15:20 PM] Launchpad: 3) YOU don't understand the underlying technology
[8/18/17, 3:15:30 PM] Justin: I'm sure some people invested with the idea
[8/18/17, 3:16:01 PM] Justin: Others just saw t went from .02 to .80 and bought in
[8/18/17, 3:16:18 PM] Launchpad: ok
[8/18/17, 3:16:24 PM] Launchpad: so what, that happens everywhere
[8/18/17, 3:16:28 PM] Justin: I'm just saying launching g Taylor swift into space seems smart
[8/18/17, 3:16:30 PM] Launchpad: do you want people to be punished?
[8/18/17, 3:16:36 PM] Justin: So reminds me of lottery winners
[8/18/17, 3:16:51 PM] Launchpad: his mom is an astronaut....probably a pretty bright kid....
[8/18/17, 3:16:56 PM] Justin: Nah I'm just saying, be interesting to have some comparative studies Years from now
[8/18/17, 3:17:12 PM] Launchpad: sure...people have lost their shirts on bitcoin
[8/18/17, 3:17:15 PM] Justin: Not hating on bitcoin
[8/18/17, 3:17:21 PM] Launchpad: and others have made millions
[8/18/17, 3:17:22 PM] Justin: Actually signed up for coin base yesterday
[8/18/17, 3:17:31 PM] Launchpad: hahaha nice
[8/18/17, 3:17:35 PM] Launchpad: get that poker money
[8/18/17, 3:17:45 PM] Justin: Yeh no one plays during the day
[8/18/17, 3:17:51 PM] Launchpad: @15166335046 the top is in
[8/18/17, 3:17:58 PM] Justin: So figured time to try some international sites l, they all use bitcoin now
[8/18/17, 3:18:09 PM] Justin: Well I hold for about an hour at a time
[8/18/17, 3:18:16 PM] Miller: my boss is the biggest short signal indicator ever
[8/18/17, 3:18:25 PM] Justin: Cash is held in dollars. Transferred out of site in bitcoin
[8/18/17, 3:18:28 PM] Miller: when he got a fitbit i half jokingly told him that was a short signal
[8/18/17, 3:18:33 PM] Miller: stock literally has gotten demolished
[8/18/17, 3:18:36 PM] Launchpad: lol
[8/18/17, 3:18:55 PM] Justin: Speaking of which when is it least volatile?
[8/18/17, 3:18:55 PM] Launchpad: minimize the risk by 99%
[8/18/17, 3:18:56 PM] Miller: idk about herman, guess we will see
[8/18/17, 3:19:15 PM] Miller: twitterspehere a buzz about possibly new T$ album
[8/18/17, 3:19:16 PM] Justin: Because I understand I can pay more for cashout to be processed faster
[8/18/17, 3:19:18 PM] Miller: that or she got hacked
[8/18/17, 3:19:40 PM] Justin: I want least exposure possible
[8/18/17, 3:20:06 PM] Justin: Although would think at 4k it's probably more stable. Would need a miller confirmation of that
[8/18/17, 3:20:19 PM] Justin: Like at 800 it drops 200 that's 25%
[8/18/17, 3:20:20 PM] Miller: idk what youre talking about
[8/18/17, 3:20:23 PM] Miller: so cant confirm anything
[8/18/17, 3:20:27 PM] Justin: At 4K it needs to drop 1k
[8/18/17, 3:20:38 PM] Justin: Or is it still relative?
[8/18/17, 3:20:44 PM] Miller: you talking about the price of bitcoin?
[8/18/17, 3:20:52 PM] Justin: Yeh in terms of volatility
[8/18/17, 3:21:04 PM] Justin: Feel like at 800 it's more volatile than at say 20k
[8/18/17, 3:21:05 PM] Miller: i dont know the first thing about it
[8/18/17, 3:21:14 PM] Launchpad: find a chart of historic volatility
[8/18/17, 3:21:30 PM] Justin: Lazy
[8/18/17, 3:21:31 PM] Miller: probably need to understand the underlying price dynamics of what drives it
[8/18/17, 3:22:06 PM] Justin: But could be a decent testing for some programming
[8/18/17, 3:22:27 PM] Miller: i dont think theres any simple correlation of absolute price and volatility except for sure if something is trading at 50c every 1c tick is going to be a 2% move
[8/18/17, 3:23:07 PM] Launchpad: and bitcoin is not limited by cents, it goes about 10 decimal places
[8/18/17, 3:23:32 PM] Launchpad: the smallest possible unit is called a Satoshi
[8/18/17, 3:23:44 PM] Launchpad: there never is
[8/18/17, 3:24:38 PM] Justin: Here has to be some
[8/18/17, 3:24:40 PM] Justin: There*
[8/18/17, 3:26:24 PM] Launchpad: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation_volatility
[8/18/17, 3:32:16 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.silive.com/news/2017/08/man_charged_in_port_richmond_c.html
[8/18/17, 3:32:30 PM] Dan Watts: I was in the bank when this happened
[8/18/17, 3:33:12 PM] Launchpad: lol what happened? was it obvious the bank was being robbed?
[8/18/17, 3:34:19 PM] Launchpad: capri pants a good look on that guy üëå
[8/18/17, 3:35:48 PM] Dan Watts: I was at the ATM and I see this sketch fucking guy come in and he's carrying this fake Gucci duffel bag. I'm watching the whole time and I see him put the bag on the counter
[8/18/17, 3:36:34 PM] Dan Watts: I leave the bank and continue to watch what's going on from my car. Guy kind of walk-jogs out
[8/18/17, 3:36:57 PM] Dan Watts: But no one looked distressed in the bank so i thought it was weird but I figured nothing happened
[8/18/17, 3:37:12 PM] Launchpad: $600?
[8/18/17, 3:37:26 PM] Launchpad: could have made more money robbing a Chick-Fil-A
[8/18/17, 3:37:42 PM] Dan Watts: Then I was in my uber and the driver asked if I heard that TD bank was robbed. I asked when it was and he told me Tuesday and I knew immediately it had to be what I witnessed
[8/18/17, 3:38:21 PM] Miller: That's crazy
[8/18/17, 3:43:56 PM] Dan Watts: Those aren't capris they're just absurdly long shorts. That was one of the first thing I noticed and he had his collar popped
[8/18/17, 3:44:52 PM] Launchpad: must be an oppressed victim of the system
[8/18/17, 3:48:01 PM] Dan Watts: 100% the fault of some white guy somewhere
[8/18/17, 3:48:31 PM] Dan Watts: Banks are weapons of capitalism anyway
[8/18/17, 3:50:00 PM] Launchpad: Popped collars are definitely white guys fault
[8/18/17, 3:53:31 PM] Justin: I mean it looks like in 2014 had sharply less deviations
[8/18/17, 3:54:17 PM] Launchpad: sooo....get a time machine?
[8/18/17, 3:55:39 PM] Justin: I meant 2014 forward
[8/18/17, 3:56:22 PM] Justin: You showed a chart claiming that standard deviation does t change based on relative value. But that chart showed it did change
[8/18/17, 3:56:49 PM] Brian Katz: I like the bow tie look
[8/18/17, 3:57:12 PM] Justin: Not saying that's conclusive. But the standard deviation is sharply less in 2014-present than it was from 2011-14
[8/18/17, 3:58:26 PM] Justin: As in the entire range of deviation daily  from 10-14 was over 10 std. in 2014 present that never happened once
[8/18/17, 3:58:43 PM] Steve: Thank you sir
[8/18/17, 3:58:52 PM] Brian Katz: Woo woo
[8/18/17, 3:59:24 PM] Launchpad: it gets less volatile over time as transactions increase, but you can't look at the price on any given day and predict volatility
[8/18/17, 3:59:34 PM] Dan Watts: $$$$$ bumble photo @13478047760
[8/18/17, 3:59:49 PM] Miller: Lol that was my first thought tbh
[8/18/17, 3:59:55 PM] Launchpad: +1
[8/18/17, 4:00:18 PM] Justin: I understand that. I'm just saying buying in and holding a bitcoin over 2 hours, I wondered if I would be more or less secure at 4k a bitcoin than buying in when bitcoin was at 30$ a coin
[8/18/17, 4:00:28 PM] Justin: That chart seems to indicate I'm more secure
[8/18/17, 4:00:37 PM] Launchpad: correct
[8/18/17, 4:00:52 PM] Miller: Why are you buying bitcoin?
[8/18/17, 4:01:02 PM] Launchpad: to play poker
[8/18/17, 4:01:03 PM] Justin: Poker site
[8/18/17, 4:01:07 PM] Miller: Gotcha
[8/18/17, 4:01:31 PM] Miller: If you are holding it for such a short time I wouldn't worry about it
[8/18/17, 4:01:35 PM] Justin: People apparently gotta work during day in New Jersey. Wanted to play more hours during day so need to fund a foreign site with bitcoin
[8/18/17, 4:02:10 PM] Justin: Yeh. Plus even 10% on 2k cashout only cost 200
[8/18/17, 4:02:33 PM] Justin: Fees are small enough I could just cash out in chunks reduce volatility
[8/18/17, 4:02:59 PM] Justin: Like 1$ gets you expedited bitcoin transfers
[8/18/17, 4:02:35 PM] Steve: #fakenews
[8/18/17, 4:04:36 PM] Miller: Even if it does move 10 percent could easily move up just as easily as down, probably nets out very small in long run
[8/18/17, 4:06:52 PM] Miller: Cmon are you wearing the same tie also
[8/18/17, 4:06:59 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/18/17, 4:07:01 PM] Steve: Probably
[8/18/17, 4:07:05 PM] Steve: He's a simple man
[8/18/17, 4:07:08 PM] Steve: Don't hate
[8/18/17, 4:08:02 PM] Miller: That guy packs like 15 outfits for a weekend trip, he's not a simple man
[8/18/17, 4:08:45 PM] Launchpad: then takes off all his clothes off as soon as he gets off the plane
[8/18/17, 4:10:25 PM] Steve: He doesn't have a large variety of suits though
[8/18/17, 4:10:37 PM] Steve: Suits are a different animal
[8/18/17, 4:10:48 PM] Steve: In fact, I wore the same suit just with a bow tie
[8/18/17, 4:10:54 PM] Steve: My charcoal black
[8/18/17, 4:11:21 PM] Miller: I get that, that's normal, but you gotta at least switch up the shirts and ties so you look different
[8/18/17, 4:11:43 PM] Steve: True
[8/18/17, 4:11:53 PM] Steve: But again, with suits, he's a simple man
[8/18/17, 4:12:19 PM] Miller: There's a headline I agree with
[8/18/17, 4:12:31 PM] Miller: Goddamn Instagram food
[8/18/17, 4:12:58 PM] Launchpad: reminds me of http://www.torpasta.com/
[8/18/17, 4:23:40 PM] Brian Katz: Not going to get into the specifics, but August 18th is the day I passed @16316620763 on the scale. Long live Tim Ferriss
[8/18/17, 4:25:00 PM] Dan Watts: üôåüôåüôåüôå
[8/18/17, 4:25:09 PM] Dan Watts: Katz are you going NYCFC Sunday?
[8/18/17, 4:25:14 PM] Brian Katz: Yup
[8/18/17, 4:25:59 PM] Steve: My parents are also
[8/18/17, 4:25:59 PM] Dan Watts: Ok I'll prob go
[8/18/17, 4:27:17 PM] Brian Katz: I'll say hi
[8/18/17, 4:27:36 PM] Brian Katz: We play New England I believe
[8/18/17, 4:31:15 PM] Justin: We're sticking with theoretically  passed herman on scale. Come back on Monday.
[8/18/17, 4:31:33 PM] Brian Katz: I'll also be lighter in Monday
[8/18/17, 4:31:41 PM] Brian Katz: You chasing me now mi amigo
[8/18/17, 4:31:45 PM] Justin: No more cheat days?
[8/18/17, 4:32:14 PM] Brian Katz: I do a long run on Sunday, and it puts me back to where I was
[8/18/17, 4:33:00 PM] Brian Katz: Also you going to Montreal
[8/18/17, 4:34:01 PM] Justin: I mean was presumably bound to happen. 2 weeks of birthday didn't help
[8/18/17, 4:34:27 PM] Justin: Presumed it would be at 232
[8/18/17, 4:34:31 PM] Brian Katz: Why did you celebrate birthdays for two week? Usually it's a one day affair
[8/18/17, 4:34:34 PM] Justin: But seems like we. It's stalled
[8/18/17, 4:34:41 PM] Justin: Her birthday was 4th
[8/18/17, 4:34:49 PM] Brian Katz: That's one day
[8/18/17, 4:34:58 PM] Justin: Her birthday was celebrated that fri -wed with ac trip
[8/18/17, 4:35:00 PM] Brian Katz: And yours is the 13th
[8/18/17, 4:35:36 PM] Brian Katz: Look I'm not ragging on you, I'm just saying you chasing me now
[8/18/17, 4:36:14 PM] Justin: Probably will help my lifts
[8/18/17, 4:36:32 PM] Justin: No motivation to starve myself anymore lol
[8/18/17, 4:36:51 PM] Brian Katz: That's the whole point, get it Herm, I want you to pass me, so I can try and pass you again
[8/18/17, 4:37:13 PM] Brian Katz: I don't starve myself ever
[8/18/17, 4:42:09 PM] Justin: I don't either. I meant starve my muscles.
[8/18/17, 4:42:46 PM] Justin: 6 mile run pretty legit though
[8/18/17, 4:42:57 PM] Justin: That did t take long to get up to that
[8/18/17, 4:45:08 PM] Brian Katz: About 3 months
[8/18/17, 4:45:29 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/18/17, 4:46:37 PM] Justin: How long the run take?
[8/18/17, 4:46:50 PM] Launchpad: Tim Ferris Truthers get lucky again!
[8/18/17, 4:47:38 PM] Launchpad: You're losing fat AND building muscle???  "Newbie gains"
[8/18/17, 4:47:54 PM] Justin: I mean if you care to explain why katz has only lost 5 lbs in 4 weeks while running an additional 15 miles or so a week and cutting out cheat days, I'm all ears.
[8/18/17, 4:48:21 PM] Launchpad: The only thing I need to explain is that he's on a superior system
[8/18/17, 4:48:27 PM] Justin: Lol
[8/18/17, 4:48:33 PM] Justin: Fair.
[8/18/17, 4:48:33 PM] Launchpad: or maybe... #cheatdaysmatter
[8/18/17, 4:48:36 PM] Brian Katz: 1:13
[8/18/17, 4:48:46 PM] Justin: So can I say I have more muscle weight?
[8/18/17, 4:49:01 PM] Launchpad: crushing it @16318489683 how many pounds total?
[8/18/17, 4:49:04 PM] Justin: Therefore I weigh less
[8/18/17, 4:49:06 PM] Brian Katz: 89
[8/18/17, 4:49:13 PM] Launchpad: sick
[8/18/17, 4:49:35 PM] Launchpad: gotta throw you a party at the üíØ club
[8/18/17, 4:49:50 PM] Brian Katz: Woo woo
[8/18/17, 4:50:19 PM] Justin: You know lp ain't catering
[8/18/17, 4:50:34 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/18/17, 4:50:48 PM] Brian Katz: Byof?
[8/18/17, 4:51:29 PM] Launchpad: After getting back into it hard after July 4th, I've gone back down from about 195 to 184
[8/18/17, 4:53:04 PM] Brian Katz: Nice, you stopping there?
[8/18/17, 4:53:20 PM] Launchpad: nope
[8/18/17, 4:53:25 PM] Launchpad: got Europe in a month
[8/18/17, 4:54:29 PM] Brian Katz: Awesome, what's your ideal weight?
[8/18/17, 4:54:59 PM] Launchpad: tough to say...I got down to about 175 last year, my face got too skinny but my abs were pretty solid
[8/18/17, 4:55:11 PM] Launchpad: so I want a face or abs, I don't know
[8/18/17, 4:55:19 PM] Brian Katz: Solid abs are pretty legit though
[8/18/17, 4:56:01 PM] Launchpad: I think 180 is a good weight, I would be concerned with staying under -- as long as I'm sticking to the program
[8/18/17, 4:56:03 PM] Justin: Could attempt to bulk cut
[8/18/17, 4:56:13 PM] Launchpad: yeah I do want to bulk a bit more
[8/18/17, 4:56:16 PM] Brian Katz: What's that?
[8/18/17, 4:56:19 PM] Launchpad: might take creatine for shits
[8/18/17, 4:56:53 PM] Justin: It's what you do when you leave goal is no longer wight loss by body composition
[8/18/17, 4:57:12 PM] Brian Katz: But what is it?
[8/18/17, 4:57:14 PM] Launchpad: ^^
[8/18/17, 4:57:17 PM] Justin: Or when newb gains are done
[8/18/17, 4:57:36 PM] Justin: Periods of training along side increased calorie consumption
[8/18/17, 4:57:51 PM] Justin: Followed by caloric deficits
[8/18/17, 4:58:15 PM] Launchpad: I just did a HIT workout today
[8/18/17, 4:58:16 PM] Justin: It's how you can be the rock. Minus genetics and steroids
[8/18/17, 4:58:17 PM] Brian Katz: So like a week of 3500 calories a day followed by a week of 1500?
[8/18/17, 4:58:18 PM] Launchpad: fucken tough
[8/18/17, 4:58:35 PM] Justin: Well more like 6 weeks each
[8/18/17, 4:58:45 PM] Justin: Cut might be longer than bulk
[8/18/17, 4:58:53 PM] Brian Katz: Lame
[8/18/17, 4:59:11 PM] Brian Katz: Well I had a lot of bulk to work with
[8/18/17, 4:59:35 PM] Justin: Idea being you intensify training with caloric surplus. And cut it back on deficits.
[8/18/17, 5:00:25 PM] Brian Katz: What kind of calories?
[8/18/17, 5:00:34 PM] Justin: What kind of hit workout?
[8/18/17, 5:00:52 PM] Justin: Well clean in general
[8/18/17, 5:00:53 PM] Brian Katz: Idk I'm learning about this now through you
[8/18/17, 5:01:04 PM] Justin: You do t want to really eat like an asshole. But you can
[8/18/17, 5:01:27 PM] Justin: But on cut need lots and lots of protein obviously
[8/18/17, 5:01:33 PM] Brian Katz: So mostly vegetables and proteins?
[8/18/17, 5:01:48 PM] Justin: Yeh misty the diet you're on
[8/18/17, 5:01:51 PM] Justin: Mostly
[8/18/17, 5:02:07 PM] Justin: With emphasis on protein
[8/18/17, 5:02:12 PM] Brian Katz: I see, I'm trying to cut weight still. Make it easier to run
[8/18/17, 5:02:32 PM] Justin: So at a minimum 1.5g x lbf
[8/18/17, 5:02:42 PM] Brian Katz: What?
[8/18/17, 5:02:43 PM] Justin: Reality probably closer to 2-2.5
[8/18/17, 5:02:55 PM] Justin: Take body fat percentage
[8/18/17, 5:03:01 PM] Justin: Subtract that from your weight.
[8/18/17, 5:03:02 PM] Brian Katz: Okay
[8/18/17, 5:03:09 PM] Justin: That's your lean body fat weight
[8/18/17, 5:03:14 PM] Brian Katz: How can I test my body fat?
[8/18/17, 5:03:19 PM] Justin: Recommendations for protein in take go off of that
[8/18/17, 5:03:24 PM] Justin: That's more difficult
[8/18/17, 5:03:39 PM] Justin: You can estimate. Calipers are good at estimating. Miller has them
[8/18/17, 5:03:43 PM] Launchpad: basically did about 7-8 exercises, one per body part, big muscles first, little rest between sets, 1 set per body part, 8-12 reps per exercise, slow cadence (~6 seconds)
[8/18/17, 5:04:00 PM] Justin: Other than that you can do water displacement test-no idea how expensive that is.
[8/18/17, 5:04:11 PM] Justin: But say you weigh 240
[8/18/17, 5:04:17 PM] Justin: 20% bf
[8/18/17, 5:04:32 PM] Justin: That means 80% of 240= lean body fat.
[8/18/17, 5:04:42 PM] Justin: Which is about 192 lbs.
[8/18/17, 5:04:51 PM] Brian Katz: Okay
[8/18/17, 5:05:16 PM] Justin: So at minimum you want to take in 1.5g x that which is like 270 g.
[8/18/17, 5:05:49 PM] Justin: Which is 1100 calories of protein
[8/18/17, 5:05:51 PM] Brian Katz: That's a lot of protein
[8/18/17, 5:06:07 PM] Justin: So if you have 200 calories of carbs in tim ferris.
[8/18/17, 5:06:25 PM] Justin: Probably have room for about 500-700 calories of fat
[8/18/17, 5:06:40 PM] Justin: Which is little under 100 grams of fat
[8/18/17, 5:07:49 PM] Justin: Math wrong in fat. 700/9=about 75 grams fat
[8/18/17, 5:08:21 PM] Justin: So 280-40-75. Would be ideal macro.
[8/18/17, 5:42:59 PM] Miller: @13478047760 have I ever met that guy getting married? Looks mad familiar
[8/18/17, 5:46:55 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/18/17, 5:57:44 PM] Justin: Haha
[8/18/17, 7:13:36 PM] Sean: You did meet him!
[8/18/17, 7:13:57 PM] Sean: When he was at my house for my sisters wedding we came and met you guys at your place in Astoria
[8/18/17, 7:14:15 PM] Steve: Yup
[8/18/17, 7:14:25 PM] Steve: You did
[8/18/17, 7:14:46 PM] Steve: You def don't remember his name but that's your MO
[8/18/17, 7:54:48 PM] Dan Watts: @15166335046 is the worst with names
[8/18/17, 7:54:57 PM] Dan Watts: I'm very bad too tbh
[8/18/17, 8:46:31 PM] Miller: It's not my strong suit
[8/18/17, 8:47:40 PM] Miller: In my defense though
[8/18/17, 11:35:58 PM] Launchpad: tbh literally every person ever sucks with names
[8/19/17, 12:13:08 PM] Steve: He looks like he has the herman shot
[8/19/17, 12:13:13 PM] Steve: Needs immediate coaching
[8/19/17, 12:14:55 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/19/17, 12:15:07 PM] Brian Katz: He's also got the Fienberg lean

[8/20/17, 12:26:09 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/21/17, 9:57:09 AM] Miller: apparently this eclipse shit is no joke, dont look at it and dont take a selfie in front of it @16195657200
[8/21/17, 9:58:54 AM] Launchpad: Theres a 7 day music festival in Oregon just to watch it
[8/21/17, 9:59:15 AM] Miller: no no no, dont watch it
[8/21/17, 9:59:22 AM] Miller: what part of dont look at it was confusing
[8/21/17, 10:00:07 AM] Steve: Def watch it
[8/21/17, 10:00:44 AM] Launchpad: what i'm telling you is that thousands in Oregon have ingested synthetic chemicals and are waiting to burn their retinas out
[8/21/17, 10:00:55 AM] Steve: Also it's not just this eclipse
[8/21/17, 10:01:05 AM] Steve: All explodes should not be looked at directly
[8/21/17, 10:01:14 AM] Steve: *eclipses
[8/21/17, 10:01:32 AM] Steve: Sorry, solar eclipses
[8/21/17, 11:06:54 AM] Justin: Why no selfie?
[8/21/17, 11:08:07 AM] Launchpad: selfie is actually probably safer
[8/21/17, 11:14:53 AM] Justin: Yeh haven't seen any actual reason for no selfie
[8/21/17, 11:15:02 AM] Dan Watts: What time is it happening here
[8/21/17, 11:18:18 AM] Miller: You may not be in the Great American Solar Eclipse's path of totality but it's still going to be an extraordinary spectacle in New York City, with the moon covering 71% of the sun at 2:44 p.m. on Monday afternoon. Remember to protect your eyes, and be aware that taking an eclipse selfie without ISO 12312-2-certified solar glasses is extremely unsafe.
Columbia University Medical Center retina expert, Tongalp Tezel, MD, explains why: "Many people will think it‚Äôs safe to take a selfie with the eclipse in the background because they aren‚Äôt looking directly at the sun. What they may not realize is that the screen of your phone reflects the ultraviolet rays emitted during an eclipse directly toward your eye, which can result in a solar burn."

[8/21/17, 11:24:48 AM] Miller: wait him out
[8/21/17, 11:24:52 AM] Miller: theyre gonna be worthless soon
[8/21/17, 11:25:12 AM] Launchpad: actually its a her
[8/21/17, 11:25:36 AM] Launchpad: you can stuff your gender bias in a sack
[8/21/17, 11:50:04 AM] Justin: I'm not saying I'm gonna do it. But considering that is almost the only scientific warning out there, gonna go out on a limb and discount it.
[8/21/17, 11:50:20 AM] Justin: Still better safe than sorry
[8/21/17, 11:50:24 AM] Miller: seems worth it
[8/21/17, 11:50:25 AM] Miller: go for it
[8/21/17, 11:50:33 AM] Miller: probably get tons of likes on IG
[8/21/17, 11:50:40 AM] Launchpad: lol
[8/21/17, 11:50:53 AM] Miller: whats the downside? possible permanent retina damage? dont be a pussy
[8/21/17, 11:51:34 AM] Miller: im sure that Columbia University Medical Center retina expert doesnt know wtf hes talking about
[8/21/17, 11:53:42 AM] Donk: yeah im not even going outside during this whole thing
[8/21/17, 11:53:47 AM] Donk: i can watch it safely on my computer
[8/21/17, 11:55:25 AM] Donk: Wegmans just dropped out a shit ton of free sandwiches, sushi and dessert in my office, awesome
[8/21/17, 11:55:47 AM] Launchpad: nice
[8/21/17, 11:55:54 AM] Launchpad: I miss Wegmans
[8/21/17, 11:55:58 AM] Donk: (they are opening one around the corner from my office; what they dont know is that we have all been talking about it for the last year, there was no need to try and convince to come spend money there)
[8/21/17, 11:58:50 AM] Kiyoon: damn that is an awesome start to Monday
[8/21/17, 12:04:23 PM] Justin: Not disagreeing
[8/21/17, 12:13:01 PM] Miller: jelly
[8/21/17, 12:13:06 PM] Miller: miss that buffalo chicken sub
[8/21/17, 12:14:07 PM] Donk: they are apparently expecting so many people to come in the first week or two that it is open, that they are running shuttles to overflow parking lots  in some of the office buidlings nearby the store
[8/21/17, 12:14:30 PM] Donk: suffice to say that i will be avoiding it for the first couple of weeks

[8/21/17, 12:26:45 PM] Donk: yeah, LaGreca does this shit like every single day
[8/21/17, 12:26:50 PM] Donk: thats his whole schtick
[8/21/17, 12:27:26 PM] Kiyoon: "we'll be back"
[8/21/17, 12:27:41 PM] Miller: only thing that would have been better was if it was steve from queens not steve from brooklyn
[8/21/17, 12:27:49 PM] Launchpad: whats worse....the guy who's mad that they didn't PH for Judge or the guy whos mad that some guy got mad?
[8/21/17, 12:27:54 PM] Launchpad: lol
[8/21/17, 12:28:26 PM] Donk: yeah, michael kay's reaction is gold lol
[8/21/17, 12:33:26 PM] Miller: i like that he alternates b/w saying he is the one who should be mad b/c hes a mets fan and they suck and then saying he should not be mad b/c baseball is dumb and he could have been killed in barceolona

[8/21/17, 2:43:20 PM] Launchpad: whats the matter people?? You've never seen the sun before????
[8/21/17, 2:43:30 PM] Miller: people on this nasa TV are like crying
[8/21/17, 2:45:15 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/21/17, 2:45:50 PM] Tk: I still don't get the big deal. N soon as they started talking about the blinding shit. I was over it.
[8/21/17, 2:46:01 PM] Miller: is it over?
[8/21/17, 2:46:03 PM] Miller: it barely even got dark here
[8/21/17, 2:46:09 PM] Miller: gets darker when we have a thunderstorm
[8/21/17, 2:46:29 PM] Launchpad: lol its stupid....you put on these glasses that makes everything black except you can see the sun with the moon in front of it
[8/21/17, 2:46:48 PM] Launchpad: it just makes the sun look like the moon really
[8/21/17, 2:47:04 PM] Launchpad: but if theres music & partying I'm going to the festival
[8/21/17, 2:47:19 PM] Donk: i was watching on TV as it went through Jackson Hole WY
[8/21/17, 2:47:23 PM] Dan Watts: I think it's over bc I heard someone say "that was fucking amazing"
[8/21/17, 2:47:26 PM] Donk: and it got pretty much pitch black there, it was pretty cool
[8/21/17, 2:47:32 PM] Donk: but yeah, not even close to as dark here
[8/21/17, 2:48:35 PM] Dan Watts: Some girl just showed me on her phone. It was pretty cool
[8/21/17, 2:50:24 PM] Miller: lol @17189742074 using this as an oppty to pick up women
[8/21/17, 2:50:36 PM] Miller: oh hey do you like eclipses too?
[8/21/17, 2:50:47 PM] Launchpad: brilliant
[8/21/17, 2:53:08 PM] Miller: someone should have told trump you cant look at the sun w/o glasses
[8/21/17, 3:00:07 PM] Tk: He probably watched it on TV but still had the safety goggles on.
[8/21/17, 3:01:16 PM] Miller: reverse psychology, if you just tell him he cant do it he do it and then blind himself
[8/21/17, 3:09:02 PM] Tk: Random stupid question, how does the rest of nature cope w solar eclipse shit? Do mad animals just go blind also?
[8/21/17, 3:09:23 PM] Tk: Or they just smarter than we are n not look at it.
[8/21/17, 3:11:12 PM] Miller: i think since animals dont go blind normally by looking at the sun they know instinctually
[8/21/17, 3:20:19 PM] Brian Katz: Animals commit mass suicide during solar eclipses, just like the movie the happening
[8/21/17, 3:30:21 PM] Launchpad: only humans are that dumb

[8/21/17, 6:08:15 PM] Miller: I heard meh, but I haven't finished iron fist yet so not there yet
[8/21/17, 6:08:39 PM] Miller: Halfway through iron fist is better than expected because I heard pretty bad things
[8/21/17, 6:08:55 PM] Miller: The white washing thing was really dumb
[8/21/17, 6:09:15 PM] Miller: And fight scenes are much better than advertised
[8/21/17, 6:10:30 PM] Launchpad: i agree I liked iron fist
[8/21/17, 6:11:02 PM] Launchpad: the white washing thing was definitely idiotic
[8/21/17, 6:13:21 PM] Launchpad: is it just me or did Batman Begins actually just rip off Iron Fist
[8/21/17, 6:23:01 PM] Donk: I watched it over the weekend
[8/21/17, 6:23:04 PM] Donk: It was ok
[8/21/17, 6:23:30 PM] Donk: Too heavily centered on iron fist and daredevil, needed way more jessica jones and luke cage
[8/21/17, 6:24:01 PM] Donk: It was only 8 eps
[8/21/17, 6:24:29 PM] Donk: I havent watched daredevil but felt that iron fist was a considerable step below cage and jones fwiw
[8/21/17, 6:25:41 PM] Launchpad: don't know that it was a considerable step
[8/21/17, 6:25:49 PM] Launchpad: daredevil is my favorite though
[8/21/17, 6:25:57 PM] Launchpad: at least season 1
[8/21/17, 6:39:15 PM] Miller: I would say so far daredevil was the best
[8/21/17, 6:39:47 PM] Miller: I do think making defenders 8 episodes was a good idea, all of these shows seem to have too many episodes
[8/21/17, 8:25:46 PM] Donk: Cant believe that marshall couldnt catch that
[8/21/17, 8:25:54 PM] Donk: Hes gotta get that ball
[8/21/17, 8:26:26 PM] Scott: It's like her purposefully didn't try because he thought j2 would get rocked

[8/22/17, 4:01:40 PM] Brian Katz: It was a good chance for a BBQ as well
[8/22/17, 4:01:49 PM] Miller: yes that is fair
[8/22/17, 4:05:41 PM] Donk: yeah, it sucks how late these things are on
[8/22/17, 4:05:49 PM] Donk: whats so wrong at a nice 4pm fight?
[8/22/17, 4:06:02 PM] Miller: stupid west coast
[8/22/17, 4:06:57 PM] Launchpad: bet a grand make it worth it
[8/22/17, 4:07:17 PM] Brian Katz: They should just cut down on the 100 under card fights that no one cares about
[8/22/17, 4:07:52 PM] Donk: would have been cool if they had done a mixed undercard for this fight, like half boxing/half mma and do some joint blow out
[8/22/17, 4:08:04 PM] Donk: (actually dont know if they arent doing this, but assuming its going to be straight boxing)
[8/22/17, 4:08:14 PM] Miller: would have been better if they had 3 rounds of mayweather/mcgregor
[8/22/17, 4:08:18 PM] Miller: boxing
[8/22/17, 4:08:19 PM] Miller: then mma
[8/22/17, 4:08:26 PM] Miller: and then a spelling bee
[8/22/17, 4:08:30 PM] Miller: 2/3 winner takes all
[8/22/17, 4:08:52 PM] Donk: id watch that
[8/22/17, 4:09:16 PM] Donk: have to watch mcgregor closely though to make sure he doesnt just put a shit ton words spelled out on his pinstripes
[8/22/17, 4:09:25 PM] Miller: for sure, you get to see mayweahter  gets his skull smashed in MMA and then watch him struggle to spell the word cat
[8/22/17, 4:10:02 PM] Miller: that guy probably has the highest ratio of income:intelligence in the world
[8/22/17, 4:10:11 PM] Miller: i guess some of these saudi dudes might have him beat
[8/22/17, 4:11:43 PM] Donk: he certainly has to be up there with earned income:intelligence (this way we can discount all of the morons who inherit massive amounts of money.....like our president)
[8/22/17, 4:11:57 PM] Miller: yes good call
[8/22/17, 4:11:59 PM] Miller: better ratio
[8/22/17, 6:21:11 PM] Miller: Cleveland and Boston engaged in active trade discussions centered on Kyrie Irving and Isaiah Thomas, league sources tell The Vertical.
[8/22/17, 7:42:27 PM] Miller: @TheHoopCentral: If the Kyrie/Isaiah trade is completed, the details are:

Cavs: IT, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, and the Nets 2018 Pick

Celtics: Kyrie Irving
[8/22/17, 7:42:43 PM] Miller: I guess as good a trade as you could do if you're Cleveland
[8/22/17, 7:42:52 PM] Scott: Great deal for Cleveland.
[8/22/17, 7:42:59 PM] Scott: Nets pick could easily be lottery
[8/22/17, 7:43:06 PM] Scott: And this draft is even deeper than last year
[8/22/17, 7:43:11 PM] Miller: Except Isiah and LeBron both leaving in 12 months
[8/22/17, 7:43:15 PM] Miller: So they're fucked
[8/22/17, 7:43:31 PM] Miller: Guess they could throw max money at Thomas
[8/22/17, 7:43:35 PM] Scott: Top 3 picks next year look like superstars
[8/22/17, 7:43:41 PM] Scott: Could throw max at Thomas right
[8/22/17, 7:43:48 PM] Scott: Move love
[8/22/17, 7:43:54 PM] Scott: And get like Bagley or porter
[8/22/17, 7:44:03 PM] Scott: And it's a solid start to rebuild
[8/22/17, 7:44:06 PM] Miller: They should turn around and trade Thomas and LeBron tbh
[8/22/17, 7:44:13 PM] Miller: I know they won't
[8/22/17, 7:44:23 PM] Scott: Would prob trade Thomas to contender if they can't sign him
[8/22/17, 7:44:28 PM] Scott: Don't think they can
[8/22/17, 7:52:19 PM] Donk: Its a great trade for boston
[8/22/17, 7:52:52 PM] Donk: Also best cleveland likely gets
[8/22/17, 7:52:59 PM] Donk: Good deal for both
[8/22/17, 7:53:08 PM] Dan Watts: Is it done?
[8/22/17, 7:53:17 PM] Scott: Official now
[8/22/17, 7:54:27 PM] Dan Watts: Wow
[8/22/17, 7:59:19 PM] Scott: Wow is right.
[8/22/17, 7:59:28 PM] Scott: Cavs did well.
[8/22/17, 8:00:08 PM] Scott: It was the heart and soul of that team and rebuild.
[8/22/17, 8:15:52 PM] Miller: Cavs probably getting wade also
[8/22/17, 8:16:02 PM] Miller: Should pretty easily make the finals again
[8/22/17, 8:16:27 PM] Scott: Boston has a great lineup
[8/22/17, 8:16:57 PM] Miller: You want some action?
[8/22/17, 8:16:58 PM] Scott: Irving bradley smart Hayward and horrors
[8/22/17, 8:16:59 PM] Scott: Horford
[8/22/17, 8:16:59 PM] Scott: And whomever at pf

[8/22/17, 8:18:03 PM] Miller: Doesn't matter 76ers gonna win the east
[8/22/17, 8:18:11 PM] Miller: I'll bet on that
[8/22/17, 8:19:03 PM] Scott: They will be better but no
[8/22/17, 8:19:10 PM] Miller: Yes
[8/22/17, 8:19:13 PM] Scott: Boston will win that division.
[8/22/17, 8:19:20 PM] Miller: Wrong
[8/22/17, 8:19:24 PM] Miller: I'll bet you they don't
[8/22/17, 8:19:28 PM] Scott: Straight uo
[8/22/17, 8:19:30 PM] Scott: Up
[8/22/17, 8:19:34 PM] Miller: 3000 to 1 odds
[8/22/17, 8:19:38 PM] Scott: Nope
[8/22/17, 8:19:40 PM] Miller: I'll bet you 10 bucks
[8/22/17, 8:19:41 PM] Miller: Done
[8/22/17, 8:19:44 PM] Miller: On the board
[8/22/17, 8:19:48 PM] Scott: Lol nope

[8/22/17, 8:21:51 PM] Miller: At least ty Hilton doesn't have Scott Tolzien throwing to him
[8/22/17, 8:22:09 PM] Scott: Fug
[8/22/17, 8:22:21 PM] Miller: And dropkins doesn't have tom savage af throwing to him
[8/22/17, 8:22:27 PM] Miller: And Doug Martin isn't suspended
[8/22/17, 8:22:31 PM] Miller: And lacy is skinny
[8/22/17, 8:22:38 PM] Miller: And jstew still exists
[8/22/17, 8:22:52 PM] Scott: Keep h8ting
[8/22/17, 8:23:25 PM] Miller: And Greg Olsen is gonna crush it
[8/22/17, 8:28:02 PM] Kiyoon: Should've traded Hopkins for depth cheese
[8/22/17, 8:28:11 PM] Scott: Nope
[8/22/17, 8:28:18 PM] Scott: Cheese good
[8/22/17, 8:34:49 PM] Miller: Agree with kiyoon that was a good trade you should have taken it
[8/22/17, 8:36:10 PM] Scott: No.
[8/22/17, 8:41:24 PM] Launchpad: should have traded him for ajayi, diggs & a 1st
[8/22/17, 8:41:47 PM] Launchpad: while brock osweiler was throwing him the ball üòÇ
[8/22/17, 8:42:01 PM] Miller: I'm glad you didn't
[8/22/17, 8:42:07 PM] Scott: There was a deal?
[8/22/17, 8:42:38 PM] Launchpad: no, just a walk of shame I did not get to experience
[8/22/17, 8:43:49 PM] Scott: Lol
[8/22/17, 8:50:05 PM] Tk: Jon Jones tested positive after last fight. He's been stripped off the belt again.
[8/22/17, 8:50:55 PM] Scott: Wow #binghamtonpride
[8/22/17, 8:50:57 PM] Scott: Guy is an idiot
[8/22/17, 8:51:10 PM] Miller: Lol that guy needs to get some better steroids
[8/22/17, 9:17:38 PM] Miller: @JustinESports: Boston reporter: "Hello, I'm from the Globe."

Kyrie: "Excuse me?"
[8/22/17, 9:19:20 PM] Scott: Lol
[8/22/17, 9:21:04 PM] Tk: He should be banned for life at this point
[8/22/17, 9:28:08 PM] Miller: @richeisen: The UFC should just drop the pretense, let Lesnar and Jones take whatever they want and fight it out.
[8/22/17, 9:28:12 PM] Miller: Couldn't agree more

[8/23/17, 2:38:29 PM] Steve: That is dumb
[8/23/17, 2:38:40 PM] Steve: No confederate statue should still exist in America
[8/23/17, 2:38:44 PM] Steve: But that is dumb
[8/23/17, 2:42:02 PM] Miller: In espn defense I read they gave him the option to switch and he decided to, which if that's the case then fine
[8/23/17, 2:42:43 PM] Steve: Yea
[8/23/17, 2:42:53 PM] Steve: He was part of the decision
[8/23/17, 2:42:59 PM] Steve: But it's still a bit much
[8/23/17, 2:43:33 PM] Donk: so stupid
[8/23/17, 2:44:46 PM] Dan Watts: Insanity
[8/23/17, 2:56:34 PM] Dan Watts: Best part about this is the guy is Asian
[8/23/17, 2:58:01 PM] Launchpad: absolutely
[8/23/17, 2:59:59 PM] Miller: little known fact the confederate general robert e lee was asian as well

[8/23/17, 3:07:15 PM] Brian Katz: He should announce games dressed as general lee all the time lol
[8/23/17, 3:09:45 PM] Launchpad: or at least general tso
[8/23/17, 3:10:21 PM] Brian Katz: Lol even better
[8/23/17, 3:10:40 PM] Brian Katz: You know that's not a real general though
[8/23/17, 3:10:44 PM] Launchpad: free chicken giveaways all game
[8/23/17, 3:10:56 PM] Launchpad: that wont stop people from pulling his statue down
[8/23/17, 3:11:06 PM] Miller: and eating it
[8/23/17, 3:12:52 PM] Donk: i think showing the map of everywhere he accessed the site is ok, everyone can have a good laugh at that one
[8/23/17, 3:12:53 PM] Donk: but adding in what he searched for is too much
[8/23/17, 3:13:25 PM] Miller: i dont think he did that?
[8/23/17, 3:14:16 PM] Donk: i think the chicken dish was named after a real General Tso
[8/23/17, 3:14:23 PM] Miller: pretty sure it was all a joke
[8/23/17, 3:14:26 PM] Donk: but its not like he ate it or anything
[8/23/17, 3:14:38 PM] Miller: in all seriousness can we take a poll? does anyone actually have an account at a porn site (unpaid)? and if so, why?
[8/23/17, 3:15:01 PM] Miller: like who are these people that comment on these vidoes? blows my mind
[8/23/17, 3:15:26 PM] Donk: those people are doing good work though and finding out random actress names when the videos dont mention who the porn star in question is
[8/23/17, 3:15:46 PM] Donk: its like the people who make youtube videos on how to fix shit. they dont gain anything, but they have certainly helped me out when needed
[8/23/17, 3:16:59 PM] Miller: thats actually providing a real service and potentially income generating
[8/23/17, 3:17:15 PM] Miller: 99% of comments on porn videos are like wow so hot i wish i was that guy etc...
[8/23/17, 3:17:21 PM] Miller: like who are these psychopaths
[8/23/17, 3:17:42 PM] Donk: yeah those people are weird

[8/23/17, 3:22:29 PM] Miller: its too overpowering
[8/23/17, 3:24:20 PM] Miller: gotta get one of my fillings replaced, nothing more annoying than having teeth
[8/23/17, 3:24:35 PM] Miller: gonna go robert e lee style and just get wooden ones
[8/23/17, 3:24:46 PM] Kiyoon: thast why I haven't gone to the dentist in close to 8 years
[8/23/17, 3:25:18 PM] Miller: i tried that (well not 8 years) he said i was probably a few months away from needing a root canal if i didnt get this doen
[8/23/17, 3:25:18 PM] Miller: done
[8/23/17, 3:25:58 PM] Kiyoon: yeah I should probably go tot he dentist
[8/23/17, 3:28:21 PM] Brian Katz: I did that too, needed a root canal, not fun, I go twice a year now.
[8/23/17, 3:30:19 PM] Miller: was root canal as bad as i hear?
[8/23/17, 3:31:29 PM] Miller: some website said its the exposed root which is the cause of the needing the root canal which is the painful part and the root canal should actually relieve the pain, but it was some pro-dentist website that seemed like #FAKENEWS
[8/23/17, 3:33:20 PM] Brian Katz: The procedure sucked, but in the end, it stopped the pain.

[8/23/17, 5:15:04 PM] Steve: It's called sarcasm

[8/23/17, 5:23:45 PM] Scott: so dumb
[8/23/17, 5:23:56 PM] Miller: the guy played for them the day after his sister died
[8/23/17, 5:24:01 PM] Miller: and he was TRADED its not even like he bounced on his own free will
[8/23/17, 5:24:05 PM] Miller: ppl are so dumb
[8/23/17, 5:24:17 PM] Scott: IT was the heart and soul of that team, no way he wanted to leave
[8/23/17, 5:24:27 PM] Scott: ppl rooted for the celtics in the playoffs, some in part, just because of him
[8/23/17, 5:24:41 PM] Miller: unless they didnt give him a max, which im not sure they were wanted to
[8/23/17, 5:24:46 PM] Scott: treating him like cleveland did lebron
[8/23/17, 5:24:54 PM] Miller: supposedly one of the "benefits" of this trade is not having to make that decision
[8/23/17, 5:24:59 PM] Scott: its so dumb, in this nba, IT gets the max
[8/23/17, 5:25:04 PM] Miller: agreed
[8/23/17, 5:25:05 PM] Scott: 5 years ago, he doesn't
[8/23/17, 5:25:17 PM] Miller: like yes hes short
[8/23/17, 5:25:17 PM] Miller: he was short last yr
[8/23/17, 5:25:22 PM] Miller: hes not any shorter
[8/23/17, 5:25:26 PM] Scott: i have trouble tracking approximate contracts for players cause its so all over the place
[8/23/17, 5:25:35 PM] Miller: the best players get max
[8/23/17, 5:25:42 PM] Scott: yeah not even the best
[8/23/17, 5:25:43 PM] Miller: the worst players get 15m/yr
[8/23/17, 5:25:48 PM] Scott: like top couple tiers
[8/23/17, 5:25:49 PM] Miller: and avg players get 20m
[8/23/17, 5:25:54 PM] Scott: its crazy
[8/23/17, 5:26:27 PM] Miller: right any really good-great player gets a max deal
[8/23/17, 5:26:28 PM] Scott: wiggins probably doesn't get max contract 5 years ago
[8/23/17, 5:26:29 PM] Scott: now he does
[8/23/17, 5:26:53 PM] Scott: liek the cj mccollums of the nba get a max deal from the right team
[8/23/17, 5:27:04 PM] Scott: both those guys can ball, bu tthey aren't max contract players
[8/23/17, 5:27:13 PM] Miller: tim hardaway 72m
[8/23/17, 5:27:18 PM] Scott: insanity
[8/23/17, 5:27:21 PM] Miller: guy was in the nba minor leagues 12mo ago
[8/23/17, 5:27:33 PM] Scott: even if he is the outlier
[8/23/17, 5:27:36 PM] Scott: i can point to a lot others
[8/23/17, 5:27:38 PM] Miller: but he had 30 good games
[8/23/17, 5:27:42 PM] Brian Katz: The NBA is stupid
[8/23/17, 5:27:42 PM] Miller: so hes worth it
[8/23/17, 5:56:37 PM] Donk: Thomas would get the max but its going to cripple whoever gives it to him
[8/23/17, 5:56:52 PM] Donk: Short players have historically aged terribly in the nba
[8/23/17, 5:57:02 PM] Miller: Ai?
[8/23/17, 5:57:09 PM] Donk: Still 6ft
[8/23/17, 5:57:29 PM] Miller: I mean how many great players it size are there?
[8/23/17, 5:57:42 PM] Donk: Its something lile no player under 6ft over 30 has evrr made an allstar game
[8/23/17, 5:57:46 PM] Donk: And hes 29
[8/23/17, 5:58:02 PM] Miller: Seems like small sample size at best
[8/23/17, 5:58:26 PM] Miller: How many guys under 6 foot under 30 have?
[8/23/17, 5:59:03 PM] Scott: define short donk?
[8/23/17, 5:59:04 PM] Scott: under 6ft

[8/23/17, 5:59:30 PM] Scott: kyle lowry
[8/23/17, 5:59:31 PM] Scott: chris paul?
[8/23/17, 5:59:34 PM] Donk: More than zero
[8/23/17, 5:59:39 PM] Donk: All over 6ft
[8/23/17, 5:59:46 PM] Miller: Like I said, small sample size
[8/23/17, 5:59:55 PM] Miller: Was it one guy?
[8/23/17, 5:59:59 PM] Scott: actually all exactly 6 feet
[8/23/17, 6:00:46 PM] Scott: calvin murphy
[8/23/17, 6:00:46 PM] Scott: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/murphca01.html
[8/23/17, 6:00:47 PM] Scott: yoru welcome.
[8/23/17, 6:00:57 PM] Donk: Plus IT is hurt right now too
[8/23/17, 6:01:44 PM] Miller: Nate Robinson made an all star team once so therefore nobody over 30 under 6ft has ever made it
[8/23/17, 6:02:05 PM] Miller: It's like me saying Jewish pitchers age very well
[8/23/17, 6:02:11 PM] Scott: calvin murphy had a nice end of career apparently
[8/23/17, 6:03:39 PM] Miller: But Jewish 1b historically fall off cliff very early
[8/23/17, 6:09:29 PM] Scott: is ike davis a jew?
[8/23/17, 6:09:53 PM] Scott: don't know why i think that stuck with me
[8/23/17, 6:11:35 PM] Miller: That is who I was referring to
[8/23/17, 6:27:40 PM] Donk: I dont think its a small sample size at all
[8/23/17, 6:28:01 PM] Donk: There have to be hundreds if not thousands of players in nba history under 6ft
[8/23/17, 6:28:36 PM] Scott: I would say hundreds
[8/23/17, 6:28:40 PM] Scott: Not thousands
[8/23/17, 6:28:53 PM] Scott: Unless u r going back to the actual beginning of basketball
[8/23/17, 6:29:33 PM] Launchpad: https://www.leoweekly.com/2017/08/white-people/
[8/23/17, 6:29:43 PM] Launchpad: Seems reasonable
[8/23/17, 6:35:21 PM] Miller: How many who have been good to great? Because no great short over 30 year olds doesn't help me if I don't know how many great short under 30 year olds
[8/23/17, 6:35:45 PM] Scott: Calvin murphy
[8/23/17, 6:35:51 PM] Scott: Take a look at his stats
[8/23/17, 6:38:18 PM] Brian Katz: Mugsy bogues
Spud Webb
[8/23/17, 6:39:55 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/23/17, 6:41:01 PM] Scott: Hard to beat Brooklyn with the jay biggie combo
[8/23/17, 6:43:09 PM] Donk: I dont think you do. Historically there are none who have done it over 30. I dont think IT os the exception
[8/23/17, 6:43:17 PM] Donk: And easily Brooklyn
[8/23/17, 6:43:24 PM] Scott: Again Calvin fuckin murphy
[8/23/17, 6:43:39 PM] Donk: He was 30. Over 30 cheese. Learn to read
[8/23/17, 6:44:01 PM] Scott: The question was good players over 30 under 6 ft tall
[8/23/17, 6:44:08 PM] Scott: Here he id
[8/23/17, 6:44:09 PM] Scott: Is
[8/23/17, 6:44:17 PM] Donk: No, it was made an allstar team
[8/23/17, 6:51:28 PM] Justin: Oh god she's talking about systemic poverty in a Facebook post, let's blow up the internet and extrapolate a Facebook post to an entire movement
[8/23/17, 6:52:46 PM] Justin: I guess you took trump literally  when he posted a picture of a truck running over CNN reporters.
[8/23/17, 6:55:39 PM] Dan Watts: Pretty sure that's not happening
[8/23/17, 6:56:23 PM] Dan Watts: The house I'm inheriting from my parents who both came from
Nothing I should will go a black family bc of privilege? Fuck out of here that's absurd
[8/23/17, 6:57:27 PM] Scott: da fuk is LEO weekly anyway
[8/23/17, 7:03:12 PM] Dan Watts: I don't like trump I don't follow his twitter I take nothing he says literally
[8/23/17, 7:03:56 PM] Dan Watts: Donate 20% of your poker earnings
[8/23/17, 7:13:28 PM] Miller: But if there have been no great short players under 30 there's no reason to think they have any worse aging effects than taller players, just that there's an obvious correlation in basketball to some extent between height and performance in general
[8/23/17, 7:14:07 PM] Launchpad: Clearly this is your own made up interpretation.  There is no talk of 'systemic' poverty -- it just says if you're white and you own a house you should give it to a black or brown person
[8/23/17, 7:14:32 PM] Launchpad: 50%
[8/23/17, 7:15:15 PM] Launchpad: Emcees are the fucking blight on the music industry
[8/23/17, 7:15:28 PM] Steve: You don't take anything the president of the unites states says literally? You think that's normal?
[8/23/17, 7:15:32 PM] Steve: Crazy
[8/23/17, 7:15:45 PM] Miller: This is the kind of shit that makes blm look bad (if this is indeed true)
[8/23/17, 7:15:49 PM] Steve: That's where we are now I guess
[8/23/17, 7:16:38 PM] Miller: Brooklyn and it's not close
[8/23/17, 7:17:20 PM] Steve: Also, what the fuck is Leo weekly
[8/23/17, 7:17:29 PM] Dan Watts: I like how I'm grouped with trump because I think some BLM shit is insane
[8/23/17, 7:17:33 PM] Dan Watts: I despise trump
[8/23/17, 7:17:47 PM] Steve: I'm not lumping you into anything right now
[8/23/17, 7:17:47 PM] Dan Watts: But I can also think some BLM stuff is insane t
[8/23/17, 7:17:53 PM] Dan Watts: These 2 things are possible
[8/23/17, 7:17:57 PM] Steve: You can think whatever you want
[8/23/17, 7:18:07 PM] Dan Watts: Never said it was normal
[8/23/17, 7:18:16 PM] Steve: But people can also think what they want about you for thinking that
[8/23/17, 7:19:02 PM] Miller: But then he can think whatever he wants about you thinking that for whatever he wants for thinking that?
[8/23/17, 7:19:07 PM] Launchpad: you're not allowed to disagree with things without people putting labels on you and assigning you to a group
[8/23/17, 7:19:10 PM] Miller: Not sure I got that totally right tbh
[8/23/17, 7:19:23 PM] Steve: Oh you got that right
[8/23/17, 7:19:26 PM] Steve: Just sounds weird
[8/23/17, 7:19:49 PM] Steve: Oh poor snowflake
[8/23/17, 7:20:00 PM] Steve: You crying in San Diego right now?
[8/23/17, 7:20:05 PM] Steve: Get that man a Kleenex
[8/23/17, 7:20:06 PM] Launchpad: shut up republican
[8/23/17, 7:20:12 PM] Steve: I'm cool with that
[8/23/17, 7:20:17 PM] Steve: It doesn't bother me
[8/23/17, 7:20:32 PM] Steve: But it sure as hell bothers you
[8/23/17, 7:20:41 PM] Steve: And that's why I keep doing it
[8/23/17, 7:21:40 PM] Steve: So easy...
[8/23/17, 7:22:06 PM] Launchpad: like your kindof girlfriend
[8/23/17, 7:22:20 PM] Steve: Rather that than having an aarp card
[8/23/17, 7:22:40 PM] Steve: Or a vagina that was around for the Great Depression
[8/23/17, 7:22:56 PM] Steve: Did it smell like the Great Depression too?
[8/23/17, 7:23:53 PM] Launchpad: do your girls pussy smell like my dick?
[8/23/17, 7:24:13 PM] Steve: Man you are as weak as cheese üßÄ
[8/23/17, 7:24:29 PM] Steve: Yes LP, they smell like dick
[8/23/17, 7:25:48 PM] Launchpad: I wish I was as clever as you then I too would steal jokes from Grandma's Boy
[8/23/17, 7:25:58 PM] Launchpad: Steve Mencia, joke thief
[8/23/17, 7:26:06 PM] Steve: I didn't steal shit from grandmas boy
[8/23/17, 7:26:11 PM] Steve: If it was in that film
[8/23/17, 7:26:14 PM] Steve: That's awesome
[8/23/17, 7:26:36 PM] Steve: I just was r getting to you dating 55 year olds
[8/23/17, 7:26:40 PM] Launchpad: thats what Carlos Mencia said, and now hes a fucken joke
[8/23/17, 7:26:45 PM] Steve: And that was the best thing I came up with
[8/23/17, 7:27:30 PM] Steve: You're right, is steal my jokes from movies and put it on chats where everyone in the group has seen that movie
[8/23/17, 7:27:40 PM] Steve: That's my thing
[8/23/17, 7:30:51 PM] Launchpad: at least I didn't let Raj steal my girl
[8/23/17, 7:31:18 PM] Launchpad: ‚úä‚úãüé§
[8/23/17, 7:31:19 PM] Steve: No, you had Binghamton townie strippers do that
[8/23/17, 7:31:26 PM] Steve: I think I'd choose Raj
[8/23/17, 7:32:24 PM] Steve: In fact, when you pulled out the only decent thing you had to offer, it ended the party. Congrats buddy.
[8/23/17, 7:45:44 PM] Justin: Generational poverty is literally mentioned several times.
[8/23/17, 7:46:32 PM] Justin: I'm not arguing with you guys. When you start applying logic evenly come see me
[8/23/17, 7:47:08 PM] Justin: Anotherwords when you stop going to McDonald's because you associate all McDonald's with the shorty expoernce you have at one of them, than we can have logical conversations
[8/23/17, 7:47:35 PM] Justin: Until then I'm done with this selective use of logic and associations it's nonsensical
[8/23/17, 7:47:39 PM] Brian Katz: I stopped going to McDonald's
[8/23/17, 7:50:02 PM] Miller: Lol
[8/23/17, 7:50:08 PM] Miller: Can't argue with that
[8/23/17, 7:50:36 PM] Miller: I'm totally lost on this McDonald's analogy
[8/23/17, 7:50:59 PM] Justin: You wouldn't associate one local McDonald's with all McDonald's
[8/23/17, 7:51:07 PM] Justin: You would say that's a shorty McDonald's in melville
[8/23/17, 7:51:32 PM] Brian Katz: I associate one McDonald's with them all
[8/23/17, 7:51:56 PM] Miller: I think most people do
[8/23/17, 7:52:09 PM] Miller: It's actually the reason chain restaurants are successful
[8/23/17, 7:52:23 PM] Brian Katz: That's a safe place to eat anywhere you go, because they're all the same
[8/23/17, 7:52:26 PM] Miller: Or how the olive garden in times Square stays in business
[8/23/17, 7:52:50 PM] Justin: Sub in McDonald's for any business
[8/23/17, 7:52:57 PM] Brian Katz: If you like the experience you get from one of them, you'll most likely like them all
[8/23/17, 7:55:11 PM] Justin: In the case of not going to McDonald's for hearth. It would be more grounded
[8/23/17, 7:55:45 PM] Justin: As in all McDonald's offer same shit on menu
[8/23/17, 7:56:26 PM] Miller: Your argument might be more poignant if you didn't misspell every 3rd word making sentences unintelligible
[8/23/17, 7:56:47 PM] Miller: Or I'm just not smart enough to understand
[8/23/17, 7:56:48 PM] Launchpad: you mean how the discussion of generational poverty is serious, and the idea that whites should give their houses to blacks and browns is not literal
[8/23/17, 7:56:50 PM] Justin: Was at gas station
[8/23/17, 7:56:50 PM] Miller: Either way
[8/23/17, 7:57:07 PM] Launchpad: sounds like you cherry picked which part of the statement you decided was serious
[8/23/17, 7:57:52 PM] Brian Katz: This was about blacks bs whites? I thought herman was talking about McDonald's?
[8/23/17, 7:58:13 PM] Launchpad: that list of 10 demands is the core of what I gripe about -- does't matter what your race is, its the idea that people think the world will change for them cause they're too much of a coward to change themself
[8/23/17, 7:58:45 PM] Miller: The McDonald's represents the racial gap i think? Idk I didn't really follow
[8/23/17, 7:59:15 PM] Launchpad: oh you don't like that the world fat shames you???  well you can complain about it to the world, or you can go to the fucken gym.  Does it make it right that people are assholes? NO. But we know it happens....
[8/23/17, 7:59:56 PM] Miller: Now we're comparing being poor to being fat?
[8/23/17, 8:00:03 PM] Miller: Solid day for terrible analogies
[8/23/17, 8:00:21 PM] Launchpad: the idea of expecting the world to change so you don't have to
[8/23/17, 8:01:07 PM] Launchpad: I was fat. I changed
[8/23/17, 8:01:43 PM] Brian Katz: I'm lost most of the time with herman type
[8/23/17, 8:02:00 PM] Miller: Hermanese
[8/23/17, 8:02:13 PM] Tk: Power Ball drawing tonight @ $700mil. $10k for notification feeüòÜüòÜ
[8/23/17, 8:02:25 PM] Launchpad: lol good call!
[8/23/17, 8:02:26 PM] Launchpad: Deal!
[8/23/17, 8:02:40 PM] Tk: Cheese you are my lawyer
[8/23/17, 8:02:43 PM] Tk: Haha
[8/23/17, 8:02:48 PM] Miller: Bad move
[8/23/17, 8:02:57 PM] Miller: Cheese just took 105 percent
[8/23/17, 8:03:05 PM] Miller: You are now poorer than if you won
[8/23/17, 8:03:28 PM] Tk: Hahaha! We go way back.
[8/23/17, 8:04:48 PM] Brian Katz: If I win guys I'm throwing a huge party, and I'll fly everyone out
[8/23/17, 8:05:18 PM] Brian Katz: I'm also going to do a naked lap around my block
[8/23/17, 8:05:32 PM] Justin: Im parked. I'm not being selective. I don't agree nor do I give a fuck about what she says.  Yet for some reason her demands will break the right wing Internet, because lack of logic and false extrapolation, as you are highlighting
[8/23/17, 8:05:48 PM] Justin: Her ideas aren't black lives matter
[8/23/17, 8:05:48 PM] Miller: I didn't play, the lotto just contributes to a society of systemic poverty
[8/23/17, 8:05:53 PM] Miller: Also I was lazy
[8/23/17, 8:06:25 PM] Brian Katz: You got to be in it to win it homie
[8/23/17, 8:07:14 PM] Brian Katz: If I win I'll make sure every transgender is able to feed themselves, and I'll calm it yeh merenes foundation
[8/23/17, 8:07:21 PM] Brian Katz: Call*
[8/23/17, 8:07:22 PM] Launchpad: lack of education maybe?
[8/23/17, 8:07:23 PM] Launchpad: false logic?
[8/23/17, 8:08:11 PM] Launchpad: *Mencia foundation
[8/23/17, 8:08:25 PM] Justin: I'll change my analogy. If you went to one shitty McDonald's in Brooklyn would you stop eating fast food?
[8/23/17, 8:09:32 PM] Launchpad: i stopped eating meatball subs at quiznos after I got food poisoning from one
[8/23/17, 8:10:02 PM] Justin: And with trump analogy its pretty simple. You will extrapolate a Facebook post from some random member of a completely localized and scattered organization yet disregard comments from the leader of the executive branch of the United States?
[8/23/17, 8:12:22 PM] Launchpad: Are you suggesting that the BLM post is about generational poverty, and has nothing to do with the ludicrous demand to give away houses?
[8/23/17, 8:17:34 PM] Miller: So you're point is one person doesn't speak for the entire blm movement?
[8/23/17, 8:19:04 PM] Justin: I'm suggesting that one black person talking about reparations doesn't break the internet. What breaks the internet is "see look blm is rediculous they want to steal white peoples lands...racists".
[8/23/17, 8:19:10 PM] Justin: Which is literally why you shared it
[8/23/17, 8:20:04 PM] Miller: Do you see the slippery slope of someone publicly representing a group or movement sharing radical ideas like that?
[8/23/17, 8:20:25 PM] Justin: Is she advocating violence?
[8/23/17, 8:20:41 PM] Miller: If some rabbi was like German Americans should give Jews houses for the holocaust would that make me look bad? Maybe?
[8/23/17, 8:20:44 PM] Justin: Where's the slope?
[8/23/17, 8:20:53 PM] Justin: It's voluntary suggestions
[8/23/17, 8:20:52 PM] Miller: Is he speaking for me?
[8/23/17, 8:21:05 PM] Miller: I get that it's voluntary
[8/23/17, 8:21:30 PM] Miller: It's such an extreme proposition it's clearly going to alienate most people
[8/23/17, 8:22:17 PM] Miller: So I think people should be more careful about what ideas they propose when they know it could be interpreted as them representing an entire group or organization
[8/23/17, 8:22:46 PM] Justin: I mean your israe example highlights it's not too extreme
[8/23/17, 8:23:21 PM] Miller: If I went online on twitter or on TV and said a bunch of racist shit I would be fired because the company said I'm representing them badly even if I never explicitly said those are the company views
[8/23/17, 8:27:05 PM] Miller: At some point just be smarter, why give people the ammo, it's not helpful to her cause
[8/23/17, 8:27:20 PM] Justin: Some people believe in reparations
[8/23/17, 8:27:39 PM] Justin: It shouldn't be that crazy. I can disagree with it but understand he idea
[8/23/17, 8:27:51 PM] Miller: And some people believe that the earth is flat
[8/23/17, 8:29:12 PM] Launchpad: I never suggested that this is am official position of BLM - just pointing out the absurdity of one person
[8/23/17, 8:29:21 PM] Miller: Like instead of the kaepernick debate being an actual reasonable debate imagine people start arguing he should get a job, and be a starter, and be the highest paid player in the league, and be guaranteed the mvp
[8/23/17, 8:29:29 PM] Launchpad: However, Miller makes a good point
[8/23/17, 8:29:41 PM] Miller: Do you see how that would make the normal kaepernick is being blackballed people look bad?
[8/23/17, 8:55:31 PM] Kiyoon: I have no idea what you guys talking about I just saw McD's and something about poverty
[8/23/17, 8:55:33 PM] Miller: Wendy's ludicrously expensive
[8/23/17, 8:55:45 PM] Miller: Just enhances the wage gap
[8/23/17, 8:55:54 PM] Launchpad: In n Out
[8/23/17, 8:56:02 PM] Kiyoon: Moving week is awesome
[8/23/17, 8:56:07 PM] Launchpad: Highest wages, cheapest burger

[8/23/17, 8:56:24 PM] Miller: You're an adult

[8/23/17, 8:56:47 PM] Kiyoon: It's acceptable*
[8/23/17, 8:56:48 PM] Miller: (although I do the same thing whenever Nicole is gone for the week)
[8/23/17, 9:50:29 PM] Miller: Damn that blows for rich hill
[8/23/17, 10:22:53 PM] Dan Watts: Do you believe in reparations? If so start donating 20% of poker profits
[8/23/17, 10:31:43 PM] Miller: Too late he already pays 100% tax rate
[8/23/17, 10:48:48 PM] Dan Watts: Not enough
[8/23/17, 10:53:48 PM] Justin: I don't beleive in reparations. But Compensation for  slavery is no different than the creation of Israel, or native American reservation tax status. Oppressed groups being compensated for theft of land and rights. Society says reparations are "radical".    Clearly it's a widely held societal belief, considering I don't even believe in reparations (I favor traditional welfare state). But it was supposed to be  a reality with  40 acres and a mule, so once again, perception(presumably because of time gap) is the only thing that makes it "crazy".üè≥üè≥

[8/24/17, 1:42:59 PM] Steve: Or like Chelsea manning
[8/24/17, 1:46:11 PM] Justin: Definitely racist
[8/24/17, 1:46:32 PM] Launchpad: hes saying that all dicks look alike
[8/24/17, 1:51:26 PM] Miller: why do old people always sign texts like i dont know who they are from
[8/24/17, 1:51:47 PM] Donk: or address them to you as well
[8/24/17, 1:51:59 PM] Donk: My mom is this person
[8/24/17, 1:52:08 PM] Miller: everyone > 50 is
[8/24/17, 1:55:24 PM] Steve: My dad ends every email with lol
[8/24/17, 1:55:33 PM] Steve: Confused me at first
[8/24/17, 1:56:16 PM] Donk: lotsoflove'd
[8/24/17, 1:56:22 PM] Miller: probably just wants you to know he isnt mad
[8/24/17, 1:56:27 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/24/17, 1:56:32 PM] Donk: hahaha
[8/24/17, 1:56:59 PM] Miller: would be great if he had ended that email he sent you about w/e girl it was he didnt like with an lol
[8/24/17, 1:59:33 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[8/24/17, 1:59:40 PM] Steve: I have to double check
[8/24/17, 1:59:44 PM] Steve: Don't think so though
[8/24/17, 1:59:51 PM] Steve: That email was probably the best I ever received
[8/24/17, 1:59:56 PM] Scott: Ur dad sent u an email about a girl he met that u were dating that he didn't like ?
[8/24/17, 2:00:14 PM] Steve: Oh yea
[8/24/17, 2:00:23 PM] Steve: First and last time he ever did that
[8/24/17, 2:00:35 PM] Launchpad: was he 100% correct?
[8/24/17, 2:06:49 PM] Steve: Absolutely
[8/24/17, 2:07:02 PM] Steve: My father is always right (50%) of the time
[8/24/17, 2:07:31 PM] Steve: Like never bet miller
[8/24/17, 2:07:34 PM] Scott: Who was the lady
[8/24/17, 2:07:41 PM] Steve: Although I've been on a hot streak
[8/24/17, 2:07:46 PM] Steve: It was like 3 years ago
[8/24/17, 2:07:53 PM] Steve: This girl maria
[8/24/17, 2:08:13 PM] Brian Katz: The one that said pussy in front of him?
[8/24/17, 2:17:40 PM] Tk: ManU's group is a jk
[8/24/17, 2:20:18 PM] Dan Watts: My boys aresenal aren't in champions league this year so I haven't really peeped it
[8/24/17, 2:20:27 PM] Kiyoon: yeah Man U shouldn't have a huge issue advancing
[8/24/17, 2:24:00 PM] Dan Watts: Chelsea is in tough group as is Tottenham
[8/24/17, 2:24:09 PM] Dan Watts: Tottenham is in group of death
[8/24/17, 2:24:14 PM] Kiyoon: for sure
[8/24/17, 2:24:27 PM] Kiyoon: Liverpool has a fairly easy group lets go!!
[8/24/17, 2:26:06 PM] Scott: you're also an arsenal fan?
[8/24/17, 2:26:11 PM] Scott: #cheesewizzunite
[8/24/17, 2:39:02 PM] Miller: @Singlemaltfiend  Aug 22
Did ESPN stop using NFL Analyst Ray Lewis because he had the same name as the NFL Player Ray Lewis who was a murder?
[8/24/17, 2:44:40 PM] Dan Watts: Lmaoooo
[8/24/17, 2:44:47 PM] Miller: *AMAZON SAYS WHOLE FOODS TO CUT SOME PRICES STARTING MONDAY
[8/24/17, 2:45:27 PM] Launchpad: Lol
[8/24/17, 2:45:52 PM] Launchpad: Time to start shopping at WF?
[8/24/17, 2:50:48 PM] Dan Watts: üí£
[8/24/17, 3:07:58 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/24/17, 3:08:34 PM] Miller: yea he gon
[8/24/17, 3:08:38 PM] Miller: not like it matters
[8/24/17, 3:08:43 PM] Miller: maybe 5% his fault
[8/24/17, 3:21:26 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/24/17, 3:23:33 PM] Launchpad: I just fucken laughed out loud hard at that
[8/24/17, 3:25:25 PM] Brian Katz: I never got why one bad year gets a coach fired sometimes. He made the playoffs the last two yard and the World Series. His whole team went on the DL this year, and somehow firing him will make the squad better?
[8/24/17, 3:26:37 PM] Miller: its not like theres any downside, hes a below average manager
[8/24/17, 3:28:13 PM] Brian Katz: This is the start of the Mets decline for sure
[8/24/17, 3:29:43 PM] Miller: youre about 4 months too late
[8/24/17, 3:30:20 PM] Brian Katz: Do you're not going to make our yearly bet on the Mets vs Yankees next year?
[8/24/17, 3:30:24 PM] Brian Katz: So*
[8/24/17, 3:30:53 PM] Miller: that is correct
[8/24/17, 3:31:06 PM] Brian Katz: That's a bitch move
[8/24/17, 3:31:12 PM] Miller: thats fine
[8/24/17, 3:31:19 PM] Miller: i am not in the habit of making -EV bets
[8/24/17, 3:31:37 PM] Brian Katz: Ev?
[8/24/17, 3:33:05 PM] Miller: expected value
[8/24/17, 3:33:54 PM] Miller: like if i call myself a warriors fan is it a bitch move for you to not bet me the knicks are gonna win more games than the warriors?
[8/24/17, 3:34:45 PM] Steve: That's maybe the worst analogy you've ever made
[8/24/17, 3:34:53 PM] Launchpad: funny cause when you make the same bet against someone else and they ask for odds, you rip into them
[8/24/17, 3:35:01 PM] Miller: no
[8/24/17, 3:35:10 PM] Miller: when people make declarative statements and then ask for odds
[8/24/17, 3:35:19 PM] Miller: if i had said the mets are going to win more games than the yankees next year
[8/24/17, 3:35:21 PM] Miller: and then asked katz for odds
[8/24/17, 3:35:22 PM] Brian Katz: I'm not a Knicks fan
[8/24/17, 3:35:26 PM] Miller: that would be hypocritical
[8/24/17, 3:35:38 PM] Steve: That's also not even the same thing at all
[8/24/17, 3:35:42 PM] Steve: In no way
[8/24/17, 3:39:48 PM] Miller: so me not taking a bet i am going to lose b/c the team i root for in baseball sucks vs katz not taking a bet on the team he roots for in basketball sucks is the worst analogy you have ever heard?
[8/24/17, 3:39:48 PM] Miller: got it
[8/24/17, 3:40:16 PM] Scott: It's not exactly the same thing.
[8/24/17, 3:40:25 PM] Miller: that is accurate
[8/24/17, 3:40:27 PM] Miller: as no analogy is
[8/24/17, 3:40:34 PM] Scott: Exactly lol
[8/24/17, 3:40:55 PM] Miller: not being exactly the same thing does not preclude something from being a good analogy
[8/24/17, 3:41:06 PM] Miller: in fact its kind of a requirement
[8/24/17, 3:41:19 PM] Donk: i think this whole situation is different in that Miller and Katz have a year by year mets vs yankees bet
[8/24/17, 3:41:34 PM] Donk: katz hasnt asked for odds or backed out on it when the mets were supposed to be much better than the yankees
[8/24/17, 3:41:35 PM] Miller: i mean we had it for 2 years
[8/24/17, 3:41:48 PM] Miller: the only 2 times the mets were ever supposed to be better than the yankees
[8/24/17, 3:41:52 PM] Miller: thus making it a good bet for me
[8/24/17, 3:41:58 PM] Miller: thus why i would do it
[8/24/17, 3:42:04 PM] Miller: seems pretty simple?
[8/24/17, 3:42:17 PM] Donk: how much is the bet?
[8/24/17, 3:42:19 PM] Donk: a bottle of don julio?
[8/24/17, 3:42:26 PM] Brian Katz: Hibachi
[8/24/17, 3:42:31 PM] Miller: no last yr we bet pong rules which he then got out of b/c he stopped drinking
[8/24/17, 3:42:36 PM] Miller: and then this yr we bet hibachi
[8/24/17, 3:42:51 PM] Brian Katz: I thought last year was hibachi?
[8/24/17, 3:43:06 PM] Miller: no this yr is hibachi
[8/24/17, 3:43:15 PM] Miller: last yr you lost me a hibachi for something else i think
[8/24/17, 3:43:18 PM] Donk: what if they bet was hibachi every year going forward regardless? no backing out on either side, it just continues forever? that would even out the EV overtime
[8/24/17, 3:43:27 PM] Brian Katz: Why did I pay for your hibachi last year?
[8/24/17, 3:43:32 PM] Donk: make a forever hibachi bet
[8/24/17, 3:43:46 PM] Brian Katz: I'm in
[8/24/17, 3:43:49 PM] Launchpad: üëÜ
[8/24/17, 3:43:57 PM] Brian Katz: Hibachi forever bet
[8/24/17, 3:45:12 PM] Miller: mets vs yankees better record for a hibachi dinner miller vs katz - Miller Wins - cashed in
mets vs yankees better record for pong rules 2017 miller vs katz - Miller Wins
[8/24/17, 3:45:21 PM] Miller: apologies katz we had 2 bets, so we were both right
[8/24/17, 3:45:30 PM] Miller: except it wouldnt
[8/24/17, 3:45:47 PM] Steve: Bu you don't root for the warriors
[8/24/17, 3:45:48 PM] Miller: if you think it would donk then ill make an annual $50 bet with you on the red sox vs the Os
[8/24/17, 3:45:50 PM] Steve: Ever
[8/24/17, 3:45:54 PM] Steve: No one does
[8/24/17, 3:46:00 PM] Steve: That's A
[8/24/17, 3:46:02 PM] Steve: B
[8/24/17, 3:46:13 PM] Steve: the warriors are a super team
[8/24/17, 3:46:23 PM] Steve: Not the case with either the Yankees or mets
[8/24/17, 3:46:42 PM] Steve: C they are the reigning champs
[8/24/17, 3:46:45 PM] Donk: mets/yankees pretty comparable market size wise
[8/24/17, 3:46:52 PM] Steve: D you couldn't have used a worse analogy
[8/24/17, 3:47:01 PM] Steve: Almost cheese humor bad
[8/24/17, 3:47:34 PM] Miller: then in that case donk ill make an annual $50 bet with you on mets vs yankees and ill take the yankees
[8/24/17, 3:47:38 PM] Miller: similar market size
[8/24/17, 3:47:41 PM] Miller: should even out over time
[8/24/17, 3:47:53 PM] Miller: or you can make the bet with katz and take the mets
[8/24/17, 3:48:17 PM] Miller: or ill take the dodgers and you can take the angels
[8/24/17, 3:48:19 PM] Miller: same "market"
[8/24/17, 3:48:35 PM] Donk: yeah ok, i see your point here
[8/24/17, 3:48:42 PM] Kiyoon: yeah I haev an annual bet with my friend Mets Vs Yanks and Broncos vs Giants
[8/24/17, 3:49:03 PM] Donk: its a much tougher bet for baseball
[8/24/17, 3:49:05 PM] Miller: football so much parity it seems more reasonable
[8/24/17, 3:49:08 PM] Kiyoon: thats been happening for about 6 or so years now, no backing out when the mets sucked
[8/24/17, 3:49:09 PM] Donk: i would make this style of ongoing bet with football
[8/24/17, 3:49:16 PM] Miller: agreed
[8/24/17, 3:49:26 PM] Miller: but would a jets fan make a jets vs giants bet like that?
[8/24/17, 3:49:26 PM] Miller: i wouldnt
[8/24/17, 3:49:39 PM] Kiyoon: pride of your team man
[8/24/17, 3:49:45 PM] Donk: i think steve should make bets with all of us for cowboys/giants
[8/24/17, 3:49:47 PM] Steve: See the Angels dodgers analogy is closer
[8/24/17, 3:50:00 PM] Steve: But warriors/knicks?
[8/24/17, 3:50:04 PM] Steve: Not even close
[8/24/17, 3:50:38 PM] Steve: Cowboys/giants what?
[8/24/17, 3:50:40 PM] Miller: @16313981203 so take katz up on annual mets/yankees bet then
[8/24/17, 3:50:44 PM] Miller: pride of your team right?
[8/24/17, 3:50:57 PM] Donk: recurring forever bets for better record
[8/24/17, 3:51:16 PM] Miller: thats the kind of bet that probably would actually come close to evening out over time
[8/24/17, 3:51:18 PM] Steve: Against all he giants fans I know?
[8/24/17, 3:51:37 PM] Miller: yes you have to buy us all hibachi when the gmen have a better record
[8/24/17, 3:51:45 PM] Miller: and then we all pitch in and split a hibachi for you if they dont
[8/24/17, 3:51:46 PM] Donk: i meant specifically with the people in ths conversation, but if you want to expand it to every giants fan, thats on you
[8/24/17, 3:52:14 PM] Steve: I don't need to make bets you set up for me
[8/24/17, 3:52:15 PM] Donk: or steve has to eat 6 hibachi meals in 1 sitting
[8/24/17, 3:52:24 PM] Steve: Or anyone else in this chat
[8/24/17, 3:52:44 PM] Steve: Same way you won't "but me a bobble heads"
[8/24/17, 3:52:48 PM] Donk: calm down guy, its clearly a joke
[8/24/17, 3:52:49 PM] Steve: *buy
[8/24/17, 3:52:57 PM] Steve: I'm very calm
[8/24/17, 3:53:03 PM] Steve: Would love to smoke
[8/24/17, 3:53:11 PM] Steve: But other than that, relaxing in my couch
[8/24/17, 3:53:38 PM] Miller: i will buy you a bobblehead when the patriots win the AFC
[8/24/17, 3:53:58 PM] Donk: can you not smoke relaxing on your couch?
[8/24/17, 3:54:12 PM] Steve: When I don't have weed, it's difficult
[8/24/17, 3:54:18 PM] Kiyoon: I'll take the bet with Katz
[8/24/17, 3:54:25 PM] Kiyoon: but can't be hibachi considering we don't live in the same state
[8/24/17, 3:54:29 PM] Miller: done, there you go @16318489683
[8/24/17, 3:54:40 PM] Steve: Also, that was directed at donk
[8/24/17, 3:54:41 PM] Miller: give me 10% of the $ you win ty
[8/24/17, 3:54:46 PM] Steve: Clearly our bet is set
[8/24/17, 3:55:58 PM] Steve: Nice brawl in the Yankees game
[8/24/17, 3:56:07 PM] Steve: Cabrera v Romine
[8/24/17, 3:56:13 PM] Steve: I think romine actually won
[8/24/17, 3:57:20 PM] Brian Katz: On the principle of not letting miller puppet string you into this I decline the bet with you Kiyoon.
[8/24/17, 3:57:58 PM] Steve: It's what miller does second best
[8/24/17, 3:58:09 PM] Steve: That and put up quotes of players about kaepernick
[8/24/17, 4:01:36 PM] Kiyoon: maybe he's just not prideful in his team
[8/24/17, 4:03:34 PM] Miller: my overwhelming desire to not make bets i dont plan on losing overwhelms any sense of "pride"
[8/24/17, 4:03:52 PM] Miller: not sure why i would have "pride" in any sports team being good, has fuck all to do w/me
[8/24/17, 4:22:37 PM] Miller: Another big bet has come in on Conor McGregor, as the South Point sportsbook in Las Vegas just took a $50,000 wager on McGregor to win at +450. The bet would win $225K.
[8/24/17, 4:22:38 PM] Miller: madness
[8/24/17, 4:54:38 PM] Steve: Yankees/Detroit game is madness
[8/24/17, 4:54:43 PM] Steve: Like 15 ejections
[8/24/17, 4:54:46 PM] Steve: 3 brawls
[8/25/17, 7:49:52 AM] James  L: If he wasn't confirmed on Maury it's fake news

[8/25/17, 9:56:14 AM] Miller: https://youtu.be/plqPXzyyuqQ
[8/25/17, 9:56:19 AM] Miller: Wow
[8/25/17, 9:56:25 AM] Miller: Def better than fight tomorrow
[8/25/17, 9:56:26 AM] Donk: also, on the first lateral, i could have sworn the ref tried to knock the ball down
[8/25/17, 10:04:51 AM] Donk: im always amazed in these sitatuions where the person starts a fight, gets their ass handed to them, and then starts acting like the vicitim screaming like they are going to sue the person
[8/25/17, 10:05:31 AM] Miller: That girl beat her ass
[8/25/17, 1:11:29 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[8/25/17, 2:30:55 PM] Dan Watts: Ooooouuuuu
[8/25/17, 2:31:12 PM] Brian Katz: Why is steve mad?
[8/25/17, 2:31:29 PM] Steve: Is that a joke?
[8/25/17, 2:31:39 PM] Steve: Because I already knew she was doing that trip
[8/25/17, 2:32:21 PM] Launchpad: cause hes missing the ladyboy shows
[8/25/17, 2:32:41 PM] Brian Katz: Well he's been missing them for years now
[8/25/17, 2:32:45 PM] Steve: Yea that's it LP
[8/25/17, 2:33:02 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/25/17, 2:33:21 PM] Steve: I still feel the same
[8/25/17, 2:33:25 PM] Steve: Wasn't me being mad
[8/25/17, 2:33:31 PM] Steve: Just polling the crowd
[8/25/17, 2:33:35 PM] Steve: I forget
[8/25/17, 2:34:01 PM] Steve: You  and @19732079889 think everything I type here I'm mad about
[8/25/17, 2:34:11 PM] Steve: Have to put lol more often
[8/25/17, 2:34:23 PM] Miller: I see no lol in the above screenshot
[8/25/17, 2:34:23 PM] Steve: Simple minded folk
[8/25/17, 2:34:36 PM] Steve: You also don't see me mad either
[8/25/17, 2:34:42 PM] Steve: Just asking the group a question
[8/25/17, 2:34:55 PM] Steve: You are implying I'm mad
[8/25/17, 2:35:03 PM] Steve: Which is a personal opinion
[8/25/17, 2:35:08 PM] Steve: Which was clearly wrong
[8/25/17, 2:35:24 PM] Brian Katz: You mad bro?
[8/25/17, 2:35:37 PM] Miller: Seem mad
[8/25/17, 2:35:50 PM] Steve: How does a text "seem mad"?
[8/25/17, 2:35:55 PM] Miller: No lol
[8/25/17, 2:35:58 PM] Steve: I'd love to know the key
[8/25/17, 2:36:03 PM] Steve: That's it?
[8/25/17, 2:36:09 PM] Steve: Just put an lol after everything
[8/25/17, 2:36:21 PM] Steve: Every. Single. Statement. Lol
[8/25/17, 2:36:27 PM] Steve: Ok lol
[8/25/17, 2:36:33 PM] Miller: Well you said you type lol when you aren't mad so I assumed if there is no lol you're mad
[8/25/17, 2:36:35 PM] Steve: I'll make sure I do that from now on lol
[8/25/17, 2:36:44 PM] Steve: Again, I didn't say that
[8/25/17, 2:36:52 PM] Steve: I said I'd make sure I put an lol
[8/25/17, 2:37:00 PM] Miller: Previously
[8/25/17, 2:37:02 PM] Steve: Because you interpret everything I say as me being mad
[8/25/17, 2:37:04 PM] Miller: Not just now
[8/25/17, 2:37:10 PM] Steve: Even previously
[8/25/17, 2:37:29 PM] Steve: It was my mistake lol
[8/25/17, 2:37:34 PM] Steve: I'll do it from now on lol
[8/25/17, 2:37:41 PM] Steve: Every time lol
[8/25/17, 2:40:33 PM] Brian Katz: Yanks get back Castro today
[8/25/17, 3:11:12 PM] Brian Katz: Anyone else feel that Taco Bell cheese and meat is kinda gross?
[8/25/17, 3:11:29 PM] Steve: The cheese is like any other place
[8/25/17, 3:11:39 PM] Steve: The meat is def not great quality
[8/25/17, 3:11:56 PM] Steve: I always get chicken. Can't do the beef anymore. Lol lol lol
[8/25/17, 3:12:21 PM] Brian Katz: You mad bro? Lol
[8/25/17, 3:12:39 PM] Brian Katz: The chicken is better than the beef
[8/25/17, 3:12:43 PM] Steve: I added the extra lol's in my last statement
[8/25/17, 3:12:47 PM] Steve: Lol
[8/25/17, 3:12:52 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/25/17, 3:13:23 PM] Steve: I just don't want @19732079889 and @15166335046 to imply or assume things
[8/25/17, 3:13:36 PM] Brian Katz: You mad bro?

[8/25/17, 3:13:40 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/25/17, 3:13:42 PM] Miller: I fuck with some taco bell
[8/25/17, 3:13:48 PM] Miller: Dgaf
[8/25/17, 3:14:43 PM] Miller: Fairly certain it's not incrementally worse for me than anything else I consume
[8/25/17, 3:15:05 PM] Brian Katz: I'm not making that statement, just taste
[8/25/17, 3:15:29 PM] Miller: No its delicious
[8/25/17, 3:16:12 PM] Launchpad: TB is my guilty pleasure
[8/25/17, 3:16:20 PM] Miller: Although I do think taco bell probably has the most variance of any fast food place between locations
[8/25/17, 3:16:39 PM] Miller: There's 2 pretty close to me, one is way better
[8/25/17, 3:16:48 PM] Brian Katz: Last time I had it it was terrible. I hadn't eaten it since your house miller, when we ate everything downstairs while steve and Liz split a quesadilla lol
[8/25/17, 3:18:39 PM] Steve: I was very angry that night lol
[8/25/17, 3:18:54 PM] Steve: The fucking Feinberg's decided to eat without paying lol
[8/25/17, 3:19:17 PM] Steve: Angry but not surprised lol
[8/25/17, 3:19:21 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/25/17, 3:19:44 PM] Brian Katz: I love the lol after every statement. You sound insane
[8/25/17, 3:19:52 PM] Steve: I know lol
[8/25/17, 3:20:07 PM] Steve: But @15166335046 and @19732079889 have to coddled through it
[8/25/17, 3:20:08 PM] Scott: seems like the lol is necessary thoguh
[8/25/17, 3:20:11 PM] Scott: dont want to get confused
[8/25/17, 3:20:16 PM] Brian Katz: Like you're laughing like a maniac
[8/25/17, 3:20:16 PM] Steve: Until they can be in their own lol lol
[8/25/17, 3:20:41 PM] Scott: imagine if you just oddly laughed after everything you said just to maek it so that ppl knew you werent angry

[8/25/17, 3:29:23 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/25/17, 3:30:29 PM] Miller: I can't put my finger on it but he does seem less angry

[8/26/17, 10:14:12 AM] Miller: Facebook post with her face cutoff is the best she's getting
[8/26/17, 12:15:58 PM] Miller: @wojespn: Sources: Cleveland's evaluation/conversation on status of Irving/Thomas deal has remained internal. So far, team hasn't re-engaged Boston.
[8/26/17, 12:16:10 PM] Miller: Wait this deal never went through?
[8/26/17, 12:16:42 PM] Scott: It did what happened
[8/26/17, 12:17:13 PM] Steve: It was never finalized
[8/26/17, 12:17:54 PM] Steve: Apparently they are reevaluating thomas' hip
[8/26/17, 12:18:44 PM] Steve: Which points to then wanting to lock him up eventually
[8/26/17, 12:19:15 PM] Steve: Because if he walks next year, who cares about his hip
[8/26/17, 12:20:42 PM] Miller: Unless he can't play this year
[8/26/17, 12:20:58 PM] Steve: I don't think that's it
[8/26/17, 12:21:04 PM] Steve: I think it's more long term
[8/26/17, 12:21:07 PM] Steve: From what I read
[8/26/17, 12:21:13 PM] Steve: This morning
[8/26/17, 12:22:22 PM] Miller: I have no idea just saying they probably really care about his heath for this season as much as longer term considering this is their last year with LeBron likely
[8/26/17, 12:22:51 PM] Steve: Well they could resign both to the max
[8/26/17, 12:23:03 PM] Steve: Thomas has the bird rights shit
[8/26/17, 12:23:30 PM] Steve: Allowing them to go over the cap to resign then both

[8/26/17, 3:03:26 PM] Miller: Legal nonsense, not remotely rigged in the sense of reality
[8/26/17, 3:03:33 PM] Miller: Did they falsify votes?
[8/26/17, 3:05:57 PM] Miller: Like yes no shit the dnc was in favor of hrc, great
[8/26/17, 3:06:35 PM] Justin: I mean thats a goalpost shift but yeh im not saying omg the "exit Polls'
[8/26/17, 3:06:55 PM] Justin: dont think the lawsuit was either
[8/26/17, 3:07:11 PM] Miller: It's not goalposts shifting, this whole debate is irrelevant
[8/26/17, 3:07:24 PM] Miller: He had no chance
[8/26/17, 3:07:45 PM] Miller: If the situation was reversed and he had the powerful dnc machine on his side he still would have lost
[8/26/17, 3:07:49 PM] Miller: People don't like him
[8/26/17, 3:07:56 PM] Miller: Amazingly even less than they do her
[8/26/17, 3:14:14 PM] Justin: to the other goal post shift
[8/26/17, 3:14:50 PM] Scott: Hat to the side swag
[8/26/17, 3:17:08 PM] Miller: You mad nobody likes your lord and savior and he couldn't even beat out someone who lost to trump
[8/26/17, 3:17:41 PM] Miller: Keep clinging to meaningless victories though
[8/26/17, 3:19:30 PM] Miller: Wait what's Bernies 2020 poll numbers vs trump? üòÇ

Word. Thanks Mills

[8/27/17, 12:39:33 AM] Tk: He's had 6rnds to see McGregor's gm plan. He'll make the adjustments to dominate the second half
[8/27/17, 12:39:45 AM] Steve: TK, please stop lol
[8/27/17, 12:39:57 AM] Steve: We are 4 minutes delayed
[8/27/17, 10:17:44 AM] Miller: 300m and 100m early estimates for mayweather and McGregor
[8/27/17, 10:18:04 AM] Steve: Not surprising
[8/27/17, 10:19:46 AM] Miller: A lot of people complaining because the ufc TV stream stopped working at some point, I guess we got lucky

[8/29/17, 9:23:18 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[8/29/17, 9:23:28 AM] Brian Katz: Can he sell a church?
[8/29/17, 9:24:03 AM] Sean: He didn't let people in during the floods. It's absolutely crazy
[8/29/17, 9:24:33 AM] Miller: yes he has an unused 16k seating capacity arena he was not letting people use for shelter, that is bad
[8/29/17, 9:24:50 AM] Miller: even worse he was tweeting asking and linking to his church website for hurricane donations
[8/29/17, 9:25:09 AM] Miller: oh but btw those donations dont actually go to anything related to the hurricane relief effort
[8/29/17, 9:25:20 AM] Miller: small detail
[8/29/17, 9:27:02 AM] Sean: Yeah absolutely absurd
[8/29/17, 9:27:13 AM] Sean: Did they put fake pictures up of flooding?
[8/29/17, 9:27:20 AM] Brian Katz: They were just donations during an actual hurricane? lol I think Sean got the right definition of POS
[8/29/17, 9:27:24 AM] Sean: Looks like one area is flooded but the whole seating area below didn't
[8/29/17, 9:27:53 AM] Miller: right he was just generically collecting donations for his stupid church while making it seem like it was hurricane relief related
[8/29/17, 9:30:18 AM] Brian Katz: I don't get how this doesn't kill his entire church? How can you preach any of that shit, and not take care of your community when in need. The town should kick open those doors and let people stay in his stupid mega church indefinitely.
[8/29/17, 9:31:55 AM] Miller: b/c if god wanted those people to be safe and not have their homes and lives destroyed he would make it so
[8/29/17, 9:32:01 AM] Miller: who is he to argue with the plans of god
[8/29/17, 9:32:02 AM] Sean: Bc it's more of a cult and his followers won't turn on him
[8/29/17, 9:32:05 AM] Launchpad: Christians are some of the most hypocritical people on the planet. This is just par for the course
[8/29/17, 9:32:44 AM] Sean: That's not fair
[8/29/17, 9:32:55 AM] Sean: I think all religions have there hypocritical extremist
[8/29/17, 9:33:44 AM] Miller: pretty sure any sweeping generalization is going to be unfair
[8/29/17, 9:34:16 AM] Miller: i will say all these big tv preacher people are complete scam artists
[8/29/17, 9:34:48 AM] Sean: Oh yeah that's for sure
[8/29/17, 9:34:59 AM] Sean: Fucking lunatics
[8/29/17, 9:35:13 AM] Brian Katz: Agree
[8/29/17, 9:35:27 AM] Brian Katz: Modern day snake oil salesmen
[8/29/17, 9:49:34 AM] Steve: Most religions are hypocritical
[8/29/17, 9:50:59 AM] Steve: I would put Catholicism as one of the main offenders mainly because they have covered up child molestation for decades
[8/29/17, 9:51:09 AM] Steve: But many have their dark sides
[8/29/17, 9:51:25 AM] Steve: But Joel olsteen should def get his ass beat

[8/29/17, 10:58:58 AM] Launchpad: I know they parade their kids around in front of the camera its sick
[8/29/17, 11:01:05 AM] Miller: yes posting pictures of your kids so family members you dont see often can see them is the same as stabbing yourself with a knife to get sympathy
[8/29/17, 11:01:12 AM] Miller: infallible logic
[8/29/17, 11:02:24 AM] Launchpad: lol
[8/29/17, 11:03:05 AM] Launchpad: well it said he stabbed himself accidentally, maybe he tried to cover it up
[8/29/17, 11:03:18 AM] Launchpad: doubt he wanted that going viral, probably just an idiot
[8/29/17, 11:03:58 AM] Miller: the guy walked into a store, bought a knife, stabbed himself accidentally and then posted it on social media with an elaborate pre-mediated story accidentally? /r/oopsdidntmeanto
[8/29/17, 11:04:26 AM] Steve: You are a defending neo nazi? New low for @16195657200
[8/29/17, 11:06:46 AM] Launchpad: Im literally basing my comment on the pic herman posted about accidently stabbing himself - i have no idea whether the entire thing was premeditated
[8/29/17, 11:07:06 AM] Launchpad: I dont have all the üì†
[8/29/17, 11:07:56 AM] Miller: while i dont know for sure if its pre-meditated either, but let me ask a question, if you accidentally stabbed yourself would your first, second, or third thought be let me run to social media and post this injury with a made up story about someone thinking im a nazi?
[8/29/17, 11:08:25 AM] Miller: that doesnt seem like something that just spontaneously pops into someones head post-accidentally stabbing yourself
[8/29/17, 11:09:52 AM] Brian Katz: Guys a bad ad libber maybe
[8/29/17, 11:10:16 AM] Launchpad: while I see your point, it also sounds like exactly the idiotic thing someone who accidentally stabbed themself would think up to avoid looking like an idiot.  I mean its doubling down on stupidity
[8/29/17, 11:11:50 AM] Steve: No one doubles down with "a black guy stabbed me" unless they are racist
[8/29/17, 11:11:52 AM] Steve: Period
[8/29/17, 11:12:10 AM] Miller: alternate way to avoid everyone thinking youre a moron for accidentally stabbing yourself.......dont post it on social media
[8/29/17, 11:33:31 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/29/17, 11:34:04 AM] Miller: i saw that but so far no actual proof he has done so

[8/29/17, 11:34:12 AM] Miller: besides a picture of some air beds
[8/29/17, 11:34:15 AM] Justin: so essentially its not flooded

[8/31/17, 5:57:44 PM] Brian Katz: The conjuring is the stories of a real life couple, that battled ghosts. The amityville horror is about a haunted house and one families story that lived there for 28 days or something.

[9/5/17, 11:54:40 AM] Miller: According to Jackson, Jeter‚Äîwho bought the team for $1.2 billion alongside businessman Bruce Sherman‚Äîtold a potential investor earlier this summer that his first order of business at Marlins Park would be to shrink the payroll. Miami is currently sitting at $115 million in salary commitments, but Jeter wants that number to drop to as low as $55 million in 2018, depending on whether or not the front office is able to trade superstar slugger Giancarlo Stanton, who is owed $25 million next year. Should Stanton remain a Marlin, Jeter reportedly wants the team to come closer to $80‚Äì85 million for next season.

[9/5/17, 11:57:32 AM] Miller: i figured whoever bought them would do a 180 from the loria days
[9/5/17, 11:57:47 AM] Scott: u think they should get rid of bour, ozuna, not resign stanto?

[9/5/17, 11:58:35 AM] Miller: i do think they should trade stanton b/c his value will never be higher
[9/5/17, 12:00:28 PM] Donk: yeah, so if anything tanking makes even more sense if you dont need to worry about chemistry
[9/5/17, 12:01:16 PM] Scott: but you have building block sthough
[9/5/17, 12:01:21 PM] Scott: i dunno and they are young

[9/5/17, 12:05:10 PM] Donk: im not saying get rid of the cheap good young players
[9/5/17, 12:05:25 PM] Donk: but getting rid of someone like stanton makes sense depdning on the haul they will get
[9/5/17, 12:06:20 PM] Donk: but froma  working in unison perspective, that is an arguement aganist tanking in basketball, and for it in baseball, vs the opposite

[9/7/17, 11:35:43 AM] Launchpad: since when has that stopped you??
[9/7/17, 11:37:10 AM] Miller: Cleavers

https://www.yelp.com/biz/cleavers-philadelphia?utm_source=ashare&ref=yelp-android
[9/7/17, 11:37:17 AM] Miller: Might go with this
[9/7/17, 11:37:40 AM] Miller: Seems less crowded and since I have the kids somewhere I can sit down and shorter lines are ideal
[9/7/17, 2:42:39 PM] Launchpad: Marketwatch: And with that, you get our finalist list for Amazon's second headquarters: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Bridgeport, Denver, New York, Provo, Raleigh, Tampa and Washington.
[9/7/17, 2:50:58 PM] Launchpad: oooh nice the south park game comes out on my birthday
[9/7/17, 3:57:15 PM] Miller: Cleavers was awesome
[9/7/17, 3:57:23 PM] Miller: EFFIN' HOT STEAK

ribeye steak, hot cherry pepper relish, fried onions, American, Sriracha Aioli
[9/7/17, 3:57:29 PM] Miller: Right up your alley @16195657200
[9/7/17, 3:57:48 PM] Launchpad: Sold
[9/7/17, 4:33:11 PM] Scott: Here
[9/7/17, 4:33:15 PM] Scott: Go to jims
[9/7/17, 4:33:19 PM] Scott: For vheesteak
[9/7/17, 4:33:23 PM] Scott: Cheesesteak
[9/7/17, 4:33:31 PM] Scott: I'll ask taryn also for a recommendation
[9/7/17, 4:33:43 PM] Scott: Go to dinic roast pork and broccoli rabe
[9/7/17, 4:36:56 PM] Donk: Lol, only 6 hours late
[9/7/17, 4:42:10 PM] Scott: Was in court since 9 am
[9/7/17, 4:43:24 PM] Donk: ok but miller was asking for lunch recommendations for today, but yet your still responded with recommendations after he already came back and told us what he went with
[9/7/17, 4:43:45 PM] Scott: I did work on Feinberg case. #hewillthankmelater
[9/7/17, 4:44:15 PM] Donk: hes gong to be finished with law school and will take it over himself before anything gets done with it
[9/7/17, 4:44:20 PM] Brian Katz: He's not eating at jims at this point lol
[9/7/17, 4:46:55 PM] Scott: That's completely untrue donk. And most cases take 3-5 yrs in court for personal injury in at 3 yrs
[9/7/17, 4:48:25 PM] Miller: I'm not a broccoli Rabe guy so I skipped all those roast pork recommendations
[9/7/17, 4:48:38 PM] Launchpad: guy twisted his knee...how the fuck does that take 3-5 years ????
[9/7/17, 4:49:04 PM] Donk: hasnt it been 3-5 years already?
[9/7/17, 4:51:01 PM] Scott: lol
[9/7/17, 4:51:17 PM] Scott: NYS has a horrible backlog of cases, put it this way, in most counties, once you get on the trial calendar, you dont see a judge to try the case, should it be tried, for a year
[9/7/17, 4:51:37 PM] Scott: its horrendous for firms that exclusively take cases on contingency, luckily the majority of my personal clients are hourly
[9/7/17, 4:51:40 PM] Scott: or flat fee
[9/7/17, 5:31:40 PM] Kiyoon: Jim's is pretty good but I thought they closed cause they were found selling crack
[9/7/17, 5:32:35 PM] Miller: Makes sense why cheese recommended it
[9/7/17, 5:34:01 PM] Brian Katz: Onl Philly would have a statue of a fictional sports star.
[9/7/17, 5:34:30 PM] Brian Katz: Did you run up those steps?
[9/7/17, 5:34:43 PM] Miller: Of course
[9/7/17, 5:42:31 PM] Donk: its all they got

[9/7/17, 5:50:11 PM] Launchpad: Did you boo Santa Clause?
[9/7/17, 5:50:36 PM] Brian Katz: They pelted him with snowballs I thought?
[9/7/17, 5:50:55 PM] Launchpad: that too
[9/7/17, 5:51:09 PM] Launchpad: I doubt they were cheering him on as they pelted him
[9/7/17, 5:51:17 PM] Launchpad: that would be some sick Philly shit
[9/7/17, 5:57:26 PM] Launchpad: lol I wish girls messaged me that shit
[9/7/17, 8:07:38 PM] Launchpad: Boom üí£

[9/7/17, 8:08:32 PM] Miller: Gonna be the king of del boca Vista in a few years
[9/7/17, 8:08:44 PM] Miller: Good place to meet chicks also
[9/7/17, 8:09:47 PM] Launchpad: I won $100 bucks so I'm good
[9/7/17, 8:10:01 PM] Launchpad: and you're thinking of the wrong shuffleboard
[9/8/17, 7:54:05 AM] Dan Watts: There's a hipster shuffleboard place in Brooklyn. Actually a lot of fun

[9/8/17, 11:23:27 AM] Donk: side note, i looked up what the name of this book was: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None
[9/8/17, 11:23:47 AM] Donk: lets just say that the orginial title was not And Then There Were None
[9/8/17, 11:27:42 AM] Launchpad: U.N. Owen == Mr. Body??? üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è
[9/8/17, 11:28:24 AM] Launchpad: its randomly sitting on the counter in my office kitchen and I starting reading the back as I was waiting for my coffee
[9/8/17, 11:31:08 AM] Launchpad: LMAO just noticed that....
[9/8/17, 11:34:47 AM] Donk: on a book related note, i just finished this book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem and it was really fucking good. highly recommend
[9/8/17, 11:36:36 AM] Brian Katz: The solution to that book is the four hour body by Tim Ferriss lol
[9/8/17, 12:47:35 PM] Brian Katz: Where are you?
[9/8/17, 12:48:02 PM] Miller: http://www.cherrycrestfarm.com
[9/8/17, 12:54:55 PM] Justin: So pretty much you could have gone to cheese dinner recommendations?
[9/8/17, 12:56:46 PM] Miller: No I'm not in Philly anymore
[9/8/17, 12:56:59 PM] Miller: And I had already eaten a cheesesteak
[9/8/17, 1:00:20 PM] Brian Katz: You should've seen if there was a paddys pub
[9/8/17, 4:36:20 PM] Launchpad: has anyone watched that show Disjointed yet?
[9/8/17, 4:36:29 PM] Launchpad: worst rated new show on Rotten Tomatoes?
[9/8/17, 4:36:43 PM] Launchpad: Cause I gotta say, while its bad, its enjoyable
[9/8/17, 4:42:50 PM] Launchpad: 1st things first....if you are not a stoner, chances are you're not going to find a show about a bunch of stoners who own a dispensary as funny
[9/8/17, 4:43:24 PM] Launchpad: so they already lost a bunch of tomatoes
[9/8/17, 4:44:01 PM] Donk: I watched 1 episode
[9/8/17, 4:44:06 PM] Donk: It was horrible
[9/8/17, 4:44:19 PM] Launchpad: Its a sitcom with an obnoxious laugh track.  And while there are a ton of bad jokes including awkward racist jokes, there are a couple of actually really funny jokes
[9/8/17, 4:44:21 PM] Donk: I regret even watching that much
[9/8/17, 4:45:13 PM] Launchpad: I made it through most of the 2nd I think before I fell asleep
[9/8/17, 4:45:46 PM] Launchpad: i think the 2nd episode is funnier and I think they dialed down the laugh track a bit
[9/8/17, 4:45:58 PM] Launchpad: I can't really remember though I was high and tired
[9/8/17, 4:46:29 PM] Launchpad: BUT, I think this is a show that can actually be really funny, and it might take a few episodes to find its groove (ala Bojack Horseman)
[9/8/17, 4:47:12 PM] Donk: I didnt find any of it funny, mostly just painful. And im probably a major target audience
[9/8/17, 4:47:36 PM] Donk: But if you keep watching, let me know if it does get better
[9/8/17, 4:47:39 PM] Launchpad: the setting / sterotypes are pretty accurate
[9/8/17, 4:48:13 PM] Launchpad: I'm intrigued enough to keep watching. Like I thought it was painfully horrible the first 10 minutes, but it grows a little
[9/8/17, 4:48:51 PM] Launchpad: I think if you accept that there will be terrible jokes, they're actually are things that are really funny
[9/8/17, 4:49:21 PM] Launchpad: like the PTSD security guard
[9/8/17, 4:57:37 PM] Brian Katz: @19732079889 lol

[9/9/17, 11:06:29 AM] Miller: Totally worth getting my identity stolen
[9/9/17, 11:06:31 AM] Scott: That's it
[9/9/17, 11:07:00 AM] Donk: How did you find out they got you?
[9/9/17, 11:07:00 AM] Scott: It'll settle before discovery gets anywhere.

[9/9/17, 11:16:25 AM] Miller: Equifax website denied that you are opting out of the lawsuit
[9/9/17, 11:17:04 AM] Miller: I'll find out later about this trusted ID nonsense, would be so incredibly fucked up if they really automatically renew and charge people
[9/9/17, 11:19:46 AM] Scott: Okay
[9/9/17, 11:20:02 AM] Scott: This is gonna be a cheese wizz collabo. We are gonna prob file suit against Equifax.
[9/9/17, 11:20:16 AM] Scott: Need to do some more research on our end.
[9/9/17, 11:20:51 AM] Scott: Figure out if u got fucked. Don't enroll in anything yet. Let me know if there is an arbitration provision and opt yourselves out to preserve your legal rights. And I'm gonna look into this
[9/9/17, 12:48:57 PM] Sean: I got affected

[9/11/17, 11:44:00 AM] Launchpad: President Donald Trump, a climate-change denier who pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, reportedly had his 11-bedroom mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin destroyed by Irma.
[9/11/17, 11:44:13 AM] Launchpad: Playing for Mr. Trump üéª
[9/11/17, 11:45:00 AM] Donk: its perfectly normal to ahve the storm of the century multiple times every year
[9/11/17, 2:21:16 PM] Launchpad: And they‚Äôve been pulling some pretty shady sh*t

Equifax is offering free credit monitoring for those affected by the breach (gee, thanks) and has set up a site to allow users to check if their data had been compromised. Unfortunately, the site is problematic for a few reasons:

    You have to give the company who may have exposed your personal info more personal info (your SSN) to see if they exposed your personal info.
    The site doesn‚Äôt even tell you definitively whether your info has been hacked -- only that they ‚Äúbelieve that your personal information may have been impacted.‚Äù
    Equifax tells you you‚Äôve been affected no matter what name you put in the form (ie. ‚ÄúSeymour Butts‚Äù).
    There is a clause on the site stating anyone who enrolls also waives their rights to a class action lawsuit.

Equifax has since added a clause allowing people to opt out of the original clause, but you have to physically mail a written notice to the company.
[9/11/17, 2:22:43 PM] Miller: So part of that is definitely not true
[9/11/17, 2:22:57 PM] Miller: I put in nicoles and it said not impacted
[9/11/17, 2:23:13 PM] Launchpad: weird
[9/11/17, 2:23:15 PM] Miller: I am debating enrolling in this stupid protection nonsense
[9/11/17, 2:23:30 PM] Miller: Such a fucking disaster, I'm legitimately angry about it
[9/11/17, 2:23:46 PM] Miller: This is something that's going to be an issue for the rest of our lives
[9/11/17, 2:24:00 PM] Launchpad: I literally already have this from some other hack
[9/11/17, 2:24:23 PM] Miller: It's not a store credit card you just cancel and get a new one, you're not changing your ssn and dob and the value of that stolen information never expires
[9/11/17, 2:24:32 PM] Launchpad: the Chinese have all my personal info already
[9/11/17, 2:25:59 PM] Launchpad: from my background investigation done by the FBI for the VA
[9/11/17, 4:19:43 PM] Miller: Downside to having re watched the office recently i now tell everyone I'll catch them on the flippity flip and pretty sure nobody gets the reference and just think I'm a moron
[9/12/17, 8:42:01 AM] Donk: so going back to this Equifax hack - i looked into adding one of those of pin #'s with the IRS that you can get (basically assings you a pin # so that you cant file your taxes without it - adding another layer of protection)
[9/12/17, 8:42:25 AM] Donk: turns out, you can only get a PIN if you have already been a victim of it before or live in florida lol
[9/12/17, 8:42:34 AM] Donk: doesnt seem to make much sense
[9/12/17, 8:43:19 AM] Miller: Yea i just didn't wanna deal with waiting 3 days and annoying myself every time I need my credit
[9/12/17, 8:44:21 AM] Donk: the pin number would only be for filing tax returns, but yeah, closing your credit down also seems to be annoying
[9/12/17, 8:44:29 AM] Donk: not sure what im going to do yet about all of this
[9/12/17, 8:44:45 AM] Donk: not that i apply for credit very often, so probably wouldnt be that annoying for me
[9/12/17, 8:44:51 AM] Miller: I'm giving up
[9/12/17, 8:44:54 AM] Miller: Hope for the best
[9/12/17, 8:45:06 AM] Miller: 1 in 143 million decent odds
[9/12/17, 8:45:19 AM] Miller: Equifax is at this conference I'm at
[9/12/17, 8:45:29 AM] Miller: That stock is going to 0
[9/12/17, 8:45:35 AM] Miller: And these guys might go to jail
[9/12/17, 8:45:39 AM] Donk: you should go complain to all of them
[9/12/17, 9:15:36 AM] Donk: will any waiver wire bids that are submitted without a corresponding drop (if needed) be ignored?

[9/12/17, 3:52:20 PM] Dan Watts: Great question Donk
[9/12/17, 3:52:44 PM] Miller: They had cornhole at that farm I went to
[9/12/17, 3:52:51 PM] Miller: Waxed Evan real quick nbd
[9/12/17, 3:52:59 PM] Donk: for sure both, but for the sake of the exercise, you have to choose one
[9/12/17, 3:53:19 PM] Miller: Can't compare its like apples and oranges
[9/12/17, 3:53:21 PM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[9/12/17, 3:53:35 PM] Kiyoon: I'm actually getting this for my backyard...not these big cans though
[9/12/17, 3:53:43 PM] Miller: Nobody loves beer pong more than me
[9/12/17, 3:53:45 PM] Kiyoon: gtfo
[9/12/17, 3:53:48 PM] Kiyoon: you don't have to play
[9/12/17, 3:53:55 PM] Miller: And let me tell you that giant pong is the fucking worst
[9/12/17, 3:53:59 PM] Miller: It's miserable
[9/12/17, 3:54:01 PM] Kiyoon: I've played it
[9/12/17, 3:54:31 PM] Miller: Kanjam requires more skill so if I'm playing with 4 guys that would be my choice
[9/12/17, 3:54:51 PM] Miller: Kanjam with people who can't move or throw a Frisbee is terrible
[9/12/17, 3:55:17 PM] Donk: I vote KanJam as well
[9/12/17, 3:55:29 PM] Miller: As have I, once. Never again and I barely made it out alive the first time
[9/12/17, 3:56:02 PM] Kiyoon: did it take you forever or something?
[9/12/17, 3:56:26 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/12/17, 3:56:32 PM] Miller: It takes everyone forever
[9/12/17, 3:56:48 PM] Miller: Because it's a stupid awful game
[9/12/17, 3:57:06 PM] Kiyoon: It maybe took us like 5 minutes
[9/12/17, 3:57:09 PM] Miller: Kiyoon I'm the resident backyard game and beer pong expert
[9/12/17, 3:57:16 PM] Miller: This couldn't be more in my wheelhouse
[9/12/17, 3:57:17 PM] Kiyoon: yeah and i don't get how this game took you forever
[9/12/17, 3:57:28 PM] Kiyoon: how far were the cans?
[9/12/17, 3:57:37 PM] Miller: Like 30 feet or something idk
[9/12/17, 3:57:44 PM] Miller: It was like 5 years ago
[9/12/17, 3:57:58 PM] Kiyoon: 30 feet a little bit far
[9/12/17, 3:58:29 PM] Dan Watts: Voting kan jam for now bc I have only played corn hole twice
[9/12/17, 3:58:55 PM] Miller: Kanjam
Cornhole
Ladder ball
Beer pong
Getting hit by a car
Giant beer pong
[9/12/17, 3:59:04 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[9/12/17, 3:59:15 PM] Launchpad: Shuffleboard?
[9/12/17, 3:59:26 PM] Miller: Who has a concrete backyard
[9/12/17, 3:59:46 PM] Scott: schecter grew up in a concrete jungle
[9/12/17, 3:59:51 PM] Miller: Game has to able to be played on grass to qualify
[9/12/17, 4:00:45 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/12/17, 4:00:52 PM] Donk: kanjam>ladder ball>cornhole imo. I do love cornhole, but someone had to finish last
[9/12/17, 4:01:06 PM] Miller: Wait that's what you've been winning this whole time?
[9/12/17, 4:01:14 PM] Miller: Not even the game with the sticks?
[9/12/17, 4:01:15 PM] Launchpad: yes lol
[9/12/17, 4:01:22 PM] Miller: Jesus
[9/12/17, 4:01:51 PM] Miller: I dont even know what that is
[9/12/17, 4:01:53 PM] Launchpad: its a bar game
[9/12/17, 4:02:00 PM] Donk: yeah ive played it in bars
[9/12/17, 4:02:07 PM] Dan Watts: The sticks game is a lot of fun
[9/12/17, 4:02:16 PM] Donk: i could have sworn somehwere in binghamton has one, but maybe i am remembering it wrong
[9/12/17, 4:02:44 PM] Miller: Evan wanted to play at the hotel he was tight because these people were using them and they took forever
[9/12/17, 4:02:53 PM] Justin: yeh im still gonna argue shuuffleboard is the one with the sticks
[9/12/17, 4:02:57 PM] Miller: More than likely he just wanted to whack me with the stick
[9/12/17, 4:02:59 PM] Justin: this shit is mini shuffleboard
[9/12/17, 4:03:05 PM] Launchpad: its fun cause you can fuck over your opponent by knocking their points off the board
[9/12/17, 4:03:17 PM] Miller: Just like regular shuffleboard
[9/12/17, 4:03:17 PM] Justin: but i think sticks one is claled deck shuffleboard
[9/12/17, 4:03:18 PM] Miller: Lol
[9/12/17, 4:03:49 PM] Launchpad: old person shuffleboard
[9/12/17, 4:04:01 PM] Donk: oh, also underrated lawn game: Bocce (the freeform lawn kind, not the boxed in shuffleboard esque one)
[9/12/17, 4:04:14 PM] Kiyoon: 100% agreed with donk
[9/12/17, 4:04:49 PM] Kiyoon: we used to have that for phys ed
[9/12/17, 4:05:01 PM] Miller: Just played the boxed in kind as consolation for them not having the shuffleboard sticks
[9/12/17, 4:05:13 PM] Miller: Surprisingly decent game to play with a 3 year old
[9/12/17, 4:05:23 PM] Miller: And he didn't injure himself
[9/12/17, 4:05:28 PM] Donk: boxed in kind still great, but not really a lawn game
[9/12/17, 4:05:40 PM] Miller: I remember dropping one of the balls on my toe when I was little
[9/12/17, 4:07:16 PM] Dan Watts: I put shuffleboard (with sticks) in same category as bocce
[9/12/17, 4:08:00 PM] Dan Watts: Games are not transportable
[9/12/17, 4:08:37 PM] Miller: Bocce pretty transportable
[9/12/17, 4:08:43 PM] Miller: Just a bag of balls
[9/12/17, 4:10:06 PM] Dan Watts: The proper way in those sand pits
[9/12/17, 4:10:07 PM] Donk: yeah, easier to bring bocce balls somewhere than cornhole
[9/12/17, 4:10:33 PM] Launchpad: horseshoes?
[9/12/17, 4:10:40 PM] Donk: yeah, proper bocce def in the shuffleboard category - but freeform bocce is straight lawn game
[9/12/17, 4:11:38 PM] Dan Watts: Don't bring that freeform bocce around here
[9/12/17, 4:12:01 PM] Dan Watts: Horseshoes in that category

[9/13/17, 1:08:29 PM] Miller: Is it worse than launchpads idea for miniature tabletop shuffleboard?
[9/13/17, 1:09:03 PM] Donk: ha, in reality, you would probably love tabletop shuffleboard
[9/13/17, 1:10:14 PM] Miller: Launchpad is putting his shuffleboard money on the line against me in fantasy this week
[9/13/17, 1:13:23 PM] Launchpad: lol nah
[9/13/17, 1:14:51 PM] Miller: What do you have to lose?
[9/13/17, 1:15:10 PM] Launchpad: $100
[9/13/17, 1:15:40 PM] Miller: Besides that
[9/13/17, 1:52:44 PM] Miller: important question, if i like bbq type baked beans will i like these pinto beans @ chipotle?
[9/13/17, 1:52:47 PM] Miller: idk wtf a pinto bean is
[9/13/17, 1:53:29 PM] Launchpad: lol seriously?
[9/13/17, 1:53:39 PM] Launchpad: they are the same beans but without the bbq & sugar
[9/13/17, 1:53:45 PM] Launchpad: thats the difference
[9/13/17, 1:53:55 PM] Miller: sounds worse
[9/13/17, 1:54:18 PM] Launchpad: healthier for sure, sometimes baked beans are too sweet
[9/13/17, 1:54:44 PM] Launchpad: if you eat them mixed in with everything they should be fine
[9/13/17, 2:00:07 PM] Miller: Alright I'm gonna give it a try
[9/13/17, 2:00:19 PM] Miller: Need something healthy to balance out this queso
[9/13/17, 2:04:03 PM] Dan Watts: Pinto beans are cooked with bacon and in grease
[9/13/17, 2:04:12 PM] Dan Watts: Far less healthy then black beans
[9/13/17, 2:04:28 PM] Miller: Macros look similar, more sodium
[9/13/17, 2:05:14 PM] Dan Watts: At one time they used to always ask when I ordered it "they're cooked with bacon is that ok"
[9/13/17, 2:05:34 PM] Dan Watts: I guess for the kosher/vegan/Islamic
[9/13/17, 2:05:50 PM] Miller: Yea i think they've stopped cooking them when bacon
[9/13/17, 2:06:03 PM] Miller: Pretty sure they're vegetarian now
[9/13/17, 2:08:21 PM] Launchpad: I don't think they ever cooked them with bacon at Chipotle
[9/13/17, 2:08:36 PM] Dan Watts: I'm making it up
[9/13/17, 2:08:37 PM] Launchpad: Although many places do
[9/13/17, 2:08:55 PM] Miller: Lol

[9/13/17, 2:21:16 PM] Miller: consumerist? what kind of fake news commie rag is this
[9/13/17, 2:26:08 PM] Launchpad: good catch Dan
[9/13/17, 2:27:20 PM] Launchpad: to elaborate on Dan's point, many places cook their pinto beans with bacon and lard -- especially fast food mexican restaurants and the beans are refried
[9/13/17, 2:27:42 PM] Launchpad: refried beans == pinto beans
[9/13/17, 2:29:35 PM] Brian Katz: I love pinto beans. Big part of my diet
[9/13/17, 2:30:09 PM] Launchpad: they are awesome, but I prefer black beans
[9/13/17, 2:30:52 PM] Launchpad: Mexican pinto: bacon & lard
Texas BBQ pinto: bacon & sugar
[9/13/17, 2:32:12 PM] Scott: Relevant taco Tuesday related knowledge.
[9/13/17, 2:32:12 PM] Launchpad: health conscious restaurants will not add lard or sugar, and will serve them whole instead of refried

[9/19/17, 4:08:04 PM] Brian Katz: If she comes across it she very well may
[9/19/17, 8:09:49 PM] Miller: https://theintercept.com/2017/09/15/whole-foods-free-range-chicken-animal-rights/
[9/19/17, 8:09:59 PM] Miller: Pretty sure everyone owes me an apology
[9/19/17, 8:20:53 PM] Launchpad: did you point that out about whole foods specifically?
[9/19/17, 8:21:17 PM] Miller: No they stole my whole business idea
[9/19/17, 8:42:39 PM] Justin: intercept...clearly fake news

[9/20/17, 3:12:04 PM] Donk: anyone ever play skyrim or mass effect 2? ive decided that im going to play one of them next (they have been sitting on my shelf forever) was wondering if anyone would recommend one over the other
[9/20/17, 3:12:35 PM] Brian Katz: Have you played mass effect one?
[9/20/17, 3:12:51 PM] Launchpad: Fallout 4
[9/20/17, 3:12:51 PM] Donk: nope
[9/20/17, 3:13:09 PM] Donk: not helpful lol
[9/20/17, 3:14:08 PM] Miller: tomb raider
[9/20/17, 3:14:36 PM] Launchpad: I think fallout is the same engine lol
[9/20/17, 3:15:21 PM] Donk: also, dont think fallout 4 came out for xbox 360 anyway
[9/20/17, 3:16:24 PM] Brian Katz: They are all connected together through the choices you make so if say play mass effect one first. Or go play skyrim
[9/20/17, 3:20:37 PM] Donk: oh, so your choices in the first game affect the second one? thats pretty cool
[9/20/17, 3:51:34 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah, you can have characters stick around all the way through mass effect three based on your choices. And when or if they do die, you really feel the impact
[9/20/17, 4:53:13 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/news/catalan-nationalists-protest-barcelona-slideshow-wp-192808006.html ......commies are still at it

[9/20/17, 5:20:08 PM] Scott: Oooooooooo
[9/20/17, 5:21:12 PM] Miller: üëÄ
[9/20/17, 5:22:17 PM] Scott: No time. Lol
[9/20/17, 5:22:31 PM] Scott: I was just informally offered partnership.

[9/20/17, 5:23:07 PM] Miller: tell them to stuff their sorrys in a sack?
[9/20/17, 5:23:18 PM] Scott: Your asking did i?
[9/20/17, 5:24:02 PM] Miller: yes
[9/20/17, 5:24:03 PM] Miller: i am asking
[9/20/17, 5:26:02 PM] Scott: post uber-mediation we are having a substantive convo greater than the one today, i told them i'm not having a subverted ownerhsip interest, that i would need hiring/firing power etc. and we areognna discuss more
[9/20/17, 5:30:52 PM] Justin: do you hold more power post or pre uber settlement?
[9/20/17, 5:31:10 PM] Justin: like if it comes in under expectation, does that put you in worse spot?
[9/20/17, 5:31:32 PM] Justin: is that offset by if it comes in over expectation an increase in bargaining power?
[9/20/17, 5:37:49 PM] Scott: No. I want to see if it works out for me first. I would need capital to buy in. That would do it possibly. The settlement number is all over the place it's not concrete.
[9/20/17, 5:50:05 PM] Launchpad: Needs that firing power... just in case üòÇüë©üî´
[9/20/17, 5:52:40 PM] Scott: But yea. Interesting. They are afraid I'm leaving.
[9/20/17, 5:54:37 PM] Scott: They were talking about restructuring peoples offices and my boss suggested moving me into a different office. One of the other ppl said I would leave and he said I'm leaving anyway. So I guess this is an attempt to keep me. I dunno.
[9/20/17, 6:51:03 PM] Brian Katz: It's all coming up cheese, great job mi amigo!
[9/20/17, 9:38:43 PM] Scott: Thanks brother.

[9/25/17, 4:39:15 PM] Justin: " 99% of people who use the words "my taxes paid for..." dont even pay taxes"could be a shaun king tweet
[9/25/17, 4:40:34 PM] Miller: just misspelled the word in the original message calling a-rdoge the kind
[9/25/17, 4:40:36 PM] Miller: ‚Äú[NFL ratings] on CBS yesterday were UP 4% vs Week 3 of last year. Its pregame show had highest viewership in 7 YEARS.‚Äù

[10/4/17, 6:32:08 AM] Miller: Lol wtf is Cleveland doing pitching literally their worst pitcher in game 1?
[10/4/17, 6:32:30 AM] Miller: I see it's back to everyone trying to get Yankees into the world series again
[10/4/17, 6:33:12 AM] Miller: Maybe the red Sox will use sale out of the bullpen when you see them in the alcs
[10/4/17, 6:34:52 AM] Scott: it puts kluber on regular rest
[10/4/17, 6:34:54 AM] Scott: apparently he wanted that
[10/4/17, 7:15:03 AM] Miller: Lol sure
[10/4/17, 7:15:15 AM] Miller: So start your worst pitcher instead
[10/4/17, 7:15:38 AM] Miller: Also Indiana won the division by like 19 games they couldn't have figured this out before hand?
[10/4/17, 7:15:55 AM] Scott: indiana?
[10/4/17, 7:16:11 AM] Miller: Zomg I put an a instead of an s
[10/4/17, 7:16:43 AM] Miller: Now you'll never be able to figure out who I was talking about
[10/4/17, 7:16:48 AM] Scott: he had a 2.3 era in august and a 2.9 era in september
[10/4/17, 7:17:04 AM] Scott: he had a pretty good last 2 months
[10/4/17, 7:17:11 AM] Miller: He's their 4th best pitcher
[10/4/17, 7:17:17 AM] Scott: is he?
[10/4/17, 7:18:11 AM] Brian Katz: Miller is irate over this
[10/4/17, 7:18:14 AM] Scott: he's arguably their 3rd best pitcher who is the second hottest going into the postseason
[10/4/17, 7:18:40 AM] Scott: temper tantrums don't change facts.
[10/4/17, 7:18:55 AM] Brian Katz: It's okay homey number 28 will be just as sweet as 27 for you
[10/4/17, 7:19:54 AM] Miller: Okay so let's say he's their 3rd best pitcher
[10/4/17, 7:20:08 AM] Miller: Seems totally normal
[10/4/17, 7:20:57 AM] Scott: okay so that makes him not their 4th best pitcher
[10/4/17, 7:21:08 AM] Scott: he is second hottest pitcher on the team going into the playoffs
[10/4/17, 7:21:14 AM] Scott: ur number 1 wants to pitch on full rest
[10/4/17, 7:21:15 AM] Miller: It's fine I'm sure everyone really wants to see Cleveland in the world series again, the ratings will be phenomenal. Nobody would ever want the Yankees to make it over them, nobody
[10/4/17, 7:21:17 AM] Scott: its not unheard of
[10/4/17, 7:21:30 AM] Scott: your right, its a conspiracy
[10/4/17, 7:21:34 AM] Scott: just like the mets not winning the world series
[10/4/17, 7:21:36 AM] Scott: also a conspiracy
[10/4/17, 7:22:19 AM] Scott: mets clearly had all the talent to win the world series, but its mlb and the fans that didn't want it so there was a conspiracy against them
[10/4/17, 7:24:09 AM] Miller: Remember when the diamondbacks had Johnson and schilling and started Brian Anderson in game 1? Of course you do
[10/4/17, 7:26:01 AM] Scott: sure.
[10/4/17, 7:26:06 AM] Scott: lol
[10/4/17, 7:26:17 AM] Scott: of coruse that didn't happen
[10/4/17, 7:26:21 AM] Scott: but did they even have brian adnerson
[10/4/17, 7:26:27 AM] Miller: And of course who can forget the braves with Maddux and glavine letting Steve Avery pitch game 1 of their opening series every year
[10/4/17, 7:26:28 AM] Miller: And the red Sox with Pedro and schilling, we all remember Bronson arroyo starting game 1 there
[10/4/17, 7:26:30 AM] Scott: i dont remebmer him being thier 3rd starter anyway
[10/4/17, 7:26:44 AM] Scott: again, if you want to create a conspiracy, you're doing a shitty job
[10/4/17, 7:26:57 AM] Scott: kluber doesnt have a number 2 counterpart on his team at hte level of those others
[10/4/17, 7:27:11 AM] Miller: After all he was on a hot streak
[10/4/17, 7:27:34 AM] Miller: Carrasco?
[10/4/17, 7:28:38 AM] Miller: And lol if you think a team that won their division by 17 fucking games couldn't figure out how to set up their rotation so the guy they wanted could pitch on regular rest
[10/4/17, 7:29:16 AM] Brian Katz: Let's go Yankees
[10/4/17, 7:29:21 AM] Miller: After all not like there's really any advantage of having your best pitcher go game 1 in a 5 series
[10/4/17, 7:29:52 AM] Miller: We all remember the giants not pitching bumgarner game 1, because he definitely didn't pitch 3 games in a 5 game series
[10/4/17, 7:30:19 AM] Miller: They couldn't be bothered to set up their rotation so they just threw Matt Cain game 1
[10/4/17, 7:30:24 AM] Scott: kluber is going game 2 and 5
[10/4/17, 7:30:28 AM] Miller: These are just totally normal things we all remember
[10/4/17, 7:30:30 AM] Scott: i dont see an issue if your ace wants rest
[10/4/17, 7:30:33 AM] Scott: to be able to pitch
[10/4/17, 7:30:52 AM] Scott: they are confident in bauer
[10/4/17, 7:30:54 AM] Scott: and i presume that meanst aht kluber could go out of the pen in game 7
[10/4/17, 7:31:00 AM] Scott: sorry
[10/4/17, 7:31:50 AM] Miller: Good thing the team that wins game 1 doesn't win the series 71 percent of the time
[10/4/17, 7:31:53 AM] Scott: well bauer will pitch game 1
[10/4/17, 7:31:57 AM] Miller: That's definitely not true
[10/4/17, 7:31:58 AM] Scott: you made that up
[10/4/17, 7:31:59 AM] Scott: again
[10/4/17, 8:25:01 AM] Scott: this looks hilarious: http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/20828896/lavar-ball-line-trolling-2017
[10/4/17, 10:24:34 AM] Miller: https://twitter.com/ThatEricAlper/status/915393124305981440
[10/4/17, 10:43:35 AM] Justin: Lol so arguably you know more than the best coach in baseball....cool story
[10/4/17, 10:44:28 AM] Justin: You should be approaching this in the same manner you would approach a weird football betting line
[10/4/17, 10:48:55 AM] Brian Katz: And you're mets fan,so you have no idea of playoff strategy
[10/4/17, 10:55:47 AM] Miller: sure who can forget the mets throwing out steve trachsel last year in the 1 game elimination vs the giants
[10/4/17, 10:55:57 AM] Miller: i dont blame them for not wanting to waste syndergaard
[10/4/17, 10:57:44 AM] Brian Katz: Like I said. No idea of playoff strategy
[10/4/17, 11:01:24 AM] Miller: you have 3 pitchers,
1 - former cy young winner with a 2.2 ERA
2- former cy young winner with a 3.2 ERA
3 - guy who mangled his hand on a drone with a 4.2 ERA
[10/4/17, 11:01:40 AM] Miller: Now you want 2 of them to pitch twice in a 5 game series
[10/4/17, 11:01:42 AM] Miller: which 2 do you pick?
[10/4/17, 11:01:43 AM] Miller: hmmm
[10/4/17, 11:01:45 AM] Miller: gee idk
[10/4/17, 11:02:01 AM] Miller: not like a 6 year old could figure this out
[10/4/17, 11:02:05 AM] Miller: its just too complicated
[10/4/17, 11:03:47 AM] Sean: I pick 1 and 2
[10/4/17, 11:04:03 AM] Miller: no sean you are not the best manager in baseball you cannot possibly figure this out
[10/4/17, 11:04:37 AM] Miller: Furthermore if CLE is down 2-1 and if they had gone Kluber-Carrasco-Bauer, he could then go Kluber on short rest and Carrasco on regular rest
[10/4/17, 11:04:46 AM] Justin: @sean what's a cy young
[10/4/17, 11:05:11 AM] Miller: but hey congrats on getting escorted into the WS
[10/4/17, 11:05:18 AM] Miller: i hear if you play the stros in the ALCS theyre gonna use verlander in LF
[10/4/17, 11:05:39 AM] Miller: the manager said he just cant afford to lose his bat
[10/4/17, 11:05:43 AM] Justin: Such a hater
[10/4/17, 11:06:14 AM] Miller: pointing out completely insane things that have no logical explanation makes me a hater, then sure
[10/4/17, 11:06:32 AM] Justin: That's not what you're doing though
[10/4/17, 11:06:39 AM] Miller: the only hard part is trying to figure out who would possibly ever want or benefit from the yankees being in the WS
[10/4/17, 11:06:40 AM] Miller: i tried
[10/4/17, 11:06:47 AM] Miller: I, for one, cannot think of anyone
[10/4/17, 11:07:02 AM] Sean: I know it‚Äôs a prestigious baseball award
[10/4/17, 11:07:16 AM] Justin: Your extrapolating analysis to the yanks playoff run
[10/4/17, 11:07:19 AM] Justin: Hence hating
[10/4/17, 11:07:32 AM] Justin: <‚Äéaudio omitted>
[10/4/17, 11:07:43 AM] Miller: i hear the cavs are going to follow the indians plan
[10/4/17, 11:07:46 AM] Miller: theyre gonna bring lebron off the bench
[10/4/17, 11:07:53 AM] Miller: they want to keep him fresh
[10/4/17, 11:08:13 AM] Donk: sounds like herman is opening his first snack wrap of the day
[10/4/17, 11:08:35 AM] Justin: Lol garbage disposal
[10/4/17, 11:08:50 AM] Justin: Also where miller can stuff the hate
[10/4/17, 11:26:18 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/4/17, 11:26:26 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/4/17, 11:26:34 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/4/17, 11:42:12 AM] Brian Katz: Miller is SALY
[10/4/17, 11:42:16 AM] Brian Katz: SALTY*
[10/4/17, 11:47:08 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/4/17, 11:47:42 AM] Donk: going to be great when bauer throws a no-hitter tonight
[10/4/17, 11:48:18 AM] Miller: you know my feelings on results based logic, i dont care what any of them do, its irrelevant
[10/4/17, 11:48:37 AM] Donk: haha, i know, just would be great
[10/4/17, 11:48:43 AM] Miller: putting a guy with a .400 OPS against LHP into the lineup against a lefty doesnt become a good move if the guy hits a HR
[10/4/17, 11:48:51 AM] Justin: The problem is it assumes your projection is accurate
[10/4/17, 11:49:03 AM] Miller: well my projection is based on a large statistical sample size
[10/4/17, 11:49:10 AM] Miller: which is the only thing you can use to project out in baseball
[10/4/17, 11:49:13 AM] Miller: lots and lots of data
[10/4/17, 11:49:26 AM] Justin: But tons of incomplete information as well
[10/4/17, 11:49:45 AM] Justin: And something tells me Franconia has an analytics team
[10/4/17, 11:50:03 AM] Miller: unless you can prove to me francona has a goddamn crystal ball then i really dont care what he thinks he has
[10/4/17, 11:50:59 AM] Justin: What's baits record against Yankees?
[10/4/17, 11:51:08 AM] Justin: What's kluber?
[10/4/17, 11:53:20 AM] Brian Katz: Are you trying to say there's a conspiracy that the Indians want the Yankees to win the series?
[10/4/17, 11:55:23 AM] Justin: Appears they are both 2-0 against yanks and pitched well
[10/4/17, 11:55:43 AM] Justin: So that doesn't hurt your argument, but I'm sure something does
[10/4/17, 12:02:00 PM] Miller: keep looking
[10/4/17, 12:02:17 PM] Miller: theres absolutely no logical reason to not go kluber-carrasco 1-2
[10/4/17, 12:02:38 PM] Miller: probably not the indians per se
[10/4/17, 12:02:57 PM] Miller: but if you dont think mlb/fox wants yankees/dodgers WS you are kidding yourself
[10/4/17, 12:03:44 PM] Brian Katz: I'm sure they want a huge city like New York la or Boston to be in the finals in any sport
[10/4/17, 12:45:06 PM] Justin: This is pretty cool
[10/4/17, 12:45:10 PM] Justin: http://m.mlb.com/news/article/210450484/2016-postseason-shares-announced/
[10/4/17, 12:45:32 PM] Justin: Never knew that's how they did it. Why don't greedy bastard owners in football do something like this?
[10/4/17, 3:11:56 PM] Launchpad: for anyone interested (Donk?), I'm reading the new Dan Brown novel Origin and its pretty good
[10/4/17, 3:12:07 PM] Launchpad: like a Da Vinci Code that takes place in Spain

[10/4/17, 3:16:30 PM] Donk: while he isnt the greatest author by any stretch, he certainly does a good job of keeping the suspense and the plot moving forward
[10/4/17, 3:16:34 PM] Donk: i always find his books entertaining
[10/4/17, 3:17:07 PM] Launchpad: Great way to put it.  Can easily envision it made as a movie
[10/4/17, 3:17:32 PM] Launchpad: plus you get a mini art / history lesson to go with the plot
[10/4/17, 3:19:51 PM] Launchpad: took my 22 hours to get from London to SD yesterday, so I had some time to read
[10/4/17, 3:20:58 PM] Brian Katz: I fell this is more of a DM convo guys

[10/4/17, 4:58:09 PM] Launchpad: Gotta schedule an obligatory nap after eating Slaters
[10/4/17, 8:32:02 PM] Miller: Being a Rockies fan rn has to blow
[10/4/17, 9:07:08 PM] Dan Watts: I actually read the first one to its entirety and felt terribly for this kid lmao
[10/4/17, 9:07:32 PM] Miller: Lol so did I
[10/4/17, 9:13:56 PM] Dan Watts: This guy's real name is Giancarlo Stanton. I thought it was a joke
[10/4/17, 9:14:15 PM] Miller: Hahaha
[10/4/17, 9:14:18 PM] Miller: That's great
[10/4/17, 9:14:29 PM] Scott: Lol that's hilarious
[10/4/17, 9:14:47 PM] Scott: Did u say anything to him?
[10/4/17, 9:16:17 PM] Dan Watts: Of course
[10/4/17, 9:16:50 PM] Dan Watts: He's 5'8'' ginger bald dude
[10/4/17, 9:17:19 PM] Miller: Lolwut
[10/4/17, 9:18:22 PM] Scott: What firm
[10/4/17, 9:18:28 PM] Scott: I'll look out for him
[10/4/17, 9:23:19 PM] Dan Watts: Cullen Dykman
[10/4/17, 9:23:29 PM] Scott: O i c

[10/4/17, 10:06:17 PM] Miller: 4 wildcard starters combined to go 7 1/3 innings
[10/4/17, 10:06:18 PM] Miller: Ridiculous
[10/4/17, 10:06:35 PM] Miller: Bumgarner and syndergaard each pitched more themselves
[10/4/17, 10:44:16 PM] Miller: https://www.instagram.com/p/BZyyNA7lWw4/?r=wa1

[10/5/17, 5:43:15 AM] Dan Watts: Haha! Touch√©
[10/5/17, 9:24:08 AM] Miller: ESPN hiring katie nolan and some barstool guys?
[10/5/17, 9:24:18 AM] Miller: ill give them credit seems like theyre actually trying
[10/5/17, 9:31:55 AM] Brian Katz: Does anyone watch espn anymore?
[10/5/17, 12:02:29 PM] Scott: This mediation is fucking crazy.
[10/5/17, 12:18:50 PM] Brian Katz: Sounds like watts isn't getting his $125
[10/5/17, 12:20:41 PM] Scott: This is very all over the place. But uber is taking it extremely seriously
[10/5/17, 3:24:57 PM] Miller: https://deadspin.com/the-new-thing-teens-are-doing-is-called-the-port-a-pot-1819181958 holy fuck that 1st one was impressive

[10/6/17, 9:52:27 AM] Justin: Free money
[10/6/17, 9:52:50 AM] Donk: with returns like those, its no wonder they need to rely on email marketing
[10/6/17, 9:52:57 AM] Miller: My thoughts exactly
[10/6/17, 9:53:07 AM] Miller: They're looking for such a relatively small amount of money
[10/6/17, 9:53:17 AM] Miller: And promising 30 plus percent returns
[10/6/17, 9:53:30 AM] Miller: And couldn't get anyone with a brain to bite?
[10/6/17, 9:53:34 AM] Miller: Seems legit
[10/6/17, 9:54:49 AM] Miller: What's that saying about not wanting to be a member of any club that would want me, I wouldn't invest in any business that is soliciting me
[10/6/17, 9:55:25 AM] Launchpad: Groucho marx
[10/6/17, 10:01:04 AM] Miller: Oh god these new eyeball emoji are horrifying

[10/6/17, 2:11:58 PM] Donk: murdered by the text message
[10/6/17, 2:13:20 PM] Launchpad: So you don't use instant messaging anymore?
[10/6/17, 2:13:46 PM] Donk: well, i guess this may count
[10/6/17, 2:13:49 PM] Donk: or gchat actually
[10/6/17, 2:14:00 PM] Donk: so nevermind, murdered by google/other tech companies
[10/6/17, 2:14:53 PM] Brian Katz: I thought aim was done years ago
[10/6/17, 2:38:52 PM] Miller: It's still the number 1 option for communication in my industry
[10/6/17, 2:39:05 PM] Miller: I am guessing that will not be impacted
[10/6/17, 2:47:54 PM] Brian Katz: Really?
[10/6/17, 2:48:58 PM] Launchpad: im talking on skype right now

[10/8/17, 4:28:03 PM] Dan Watts: Fuck chief
[10/8/17, 4:28:25 PM] Scott: Get money?
[10/8/17, 4:28:37 PM] Brian Katz: lol I thought cheese was given news of a unnamed chiefs football players wife
[10/8/17, 4:28:49 PM] Scott: Lol
[10/8/17, 4:29:08 PM] Dan Watts: No just fuck chief
[10/8/17, 4:29:42 PM] Dan Watts: Jk good for chief I'm just having an awful fantasy day
[10/8/17, 10:22:34 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/8/17, 10:22:55 PM] Dan Watts: Easily second one
[10/8/17, 10:23:06 PM] Brian Katz: It's like an ATM
[10/8/17, 10:23:28 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao not even a question
[10/8/17, 10:24:34 PM] Brian Katz: You'd have to jack it 10000k times to make up the difference
[10/8/17, 10:27:15 PM] Dan Watts: Over the course of a life time? Easy
[10/8/17, 10:36:49 PM] Kiyoon: That's once a day for 27 ish years
[10/8/17, 10:37:02 PM] Kiyoon: Pretty doable
[10/8/17, 10:51:37 PM] Launchpad: But after 27 years one million will turn into several million. You gotta compound your jacking
[10/8/17, 10:52:55 PM] Brian Katz: You'd could double up, finish it in 13.5 years
[10/8/17, 10:55:08 PM] Launchpad: Can double up your million in 7. You'd need to quadruple up to achieve parity in 13.5 years
[10/8/17, 10:56:10 PM] Brian Katz: I don't think you can sustain a 4 nut a day habit. You'd literally take years off your life.
[10/8/17, 10:56:46 PM] Miller: Chapman got away with one there
[10/8/17, 10:57:24 PM] Launchpad: So the inevitable conclusion is you go with the second option for reasons beyond money
[10/8/17, 10:57:33 PM] Brian Katz: And we live to see tomorrow
[10/8/17, 10:58:25 PM] Brian Katz: Agreed, I could never sell out like that.
[10/8/17, 10:59:23 PM] Miller: I think I'd do it for 10m
[10/8/17, 11:00:15 PM] Brian Katz: Then you'd have to up the per time jack to 1k
[10/8/17, 11:00:36 PM] Launchpad: You have a wife though, it's much more practical for you
[10/8/17, 11:01:29 PM] Launchpad: I'm not sure what kind of person Id be after 2 weeks or not nutting if I didn't get laid in that time
[10/8/17, 11:02:22 PM] Brian Katz: What about 10 million to never jack it again, but if you fail, you'd owe 10 million
[10/8/17, 11:03:45 PM] Launchpad: Easily option 2
[10/8/17, 11:04:33 PM] Brian Katz: No in this scenario there is no option two.  It's just the 10 million with the study
[10/8/17, 11:05:00 PM] Brian Katz: Stipulations
[10/8/17, 11:06:36 PM] Launchpad: Id take the 10 million, put it in a trust I control, jack it,  owe the 10 million I no longer have, declare bankruptcy, and move on living #thatloopholelife
[10/8/17, 11:07:07 PM] Brian Katz: You could just not touch yourself lol
[10/8/17, 11:07:55 PM] Brian Katz: Okay new stipulation. Any money made off the initial 10 million will also be seized if you jack it.
[10/8/17, 11:08:08 PM] Brian Katz: Due to breach of contract
[10/8/17, 11:08:39 PM] Launchpad: Can I pay for prostitutes with that money?
[10/8/17, 11:08:47 PM] Brian Katz: Yes
[10/8/17, 11:09:08 PM] Launchpad: Then that's my new life üòÇ
[10/8/17, 11:09:20 PM] Brian Katz: But if you had dough like that you'd probably could get more women
[10/8/17, 11:09:26 PM] Brian Katz: lol I like it
[10/8/17, 11:09:28 PM] Launchpad: Launchpad the sugar daddy
[10/8/17, 11:09:33 PM] Brian Katz: Hookers and blow for Scotty
[10/8/17, 11:09:54 PM] Miller: Are you implying it's his finances that are holding him back currently?
[10/8/17, 11:10:31 PM] Brian Katz: No, but when you balling the hoes come a calling
[10/8/17, 11:12:38 PM] Launchpad: More like when you dont need a job you've got plenty of time to fuck around
[10/9/17, 11:18:42 AM] Launchpad: @16318489683 did you get your Szechuan sauce?
[10/9/17, 11:22:30 AM] Brian Katz: Nah
[10/9/17, 11:22:50 AM] Brian Katz: People were going we're waiting on line for it
[10/9/17, 11:23:13 AM] Brian Katz: Plus I do t eat mac D's anymore
[10/9/17, 11:26:41 AM] Miller: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Rick‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they‚Äôre not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúWubba Lubba Dub Dub,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé

[10/10/17, 10:09:40 PM] Donk: Nope, we lost
[10/10/17, 10:09:51 PM] Donk: And both panama and hondorus won
[10/10/17, 10:09:54 PM] Miller: Tim Howard might be the most overrated athlete in the world
[10/10/17, 10:10:12 PM] Donk: Wasnt howards fault
[10/10/17, 10:10:12 PM] Brian Katz: So lame
[10/10/17, 10:10:24 PM] Donk: The own goal was terrible
[10/10/17, 10:12:39 PM] Tk: Really!!! Thought there was a chance of a playoff spot?
[10/10/17, 10:13:07 PM] Donk: We lost that too. We went from 3rd to 5th
[10/10/17, 10:13:52 PM] Tk: Yea, I just read up on how it played out. Last minute winning goal by Panama against Costa Rico eliminated us
[10/10/17, 10:15:53 PM] Miller: @TimCary: Reminder - 92% chance to qualify coming in tonight per this. Even @ half w/ USA playing poorly, PAN & HON needed 2 goals each. And got them. https://t.co/MSlag7OH0b
[10/10/17, 10:17:24 PM] Miller: The real tragedy here is all the hipsters won't be able to pretend they give a fuck about soccer now for another 4 years
[10/10/17, 10:19:14 PM] Donk: Nah, us world cup is great. Its when we get to root for an under dog that would be a legit upset and awesome win sportswise that we dont get in other sports
[10/10/17, 10:19:28 PM] Donk: Like who cares about us basketball, its a formality
[10/10/17, 10:20:08 PM] Miller: Counterpoint soccer blows and clearly nobody playing or rooting for it gives a shit
[10/10/17, 10:20:11 PM] Brian Katz: Basketball is a snoozefest. We always have the 12 best players in the tournament we
[10/10/17, 10:21:09 PM] Donk: When football ends because no one wants brain damage, you are going to be forced into fantasy soccer
[10/10/17, 10:21:17 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[10/10/17, 10:21:22 PM] Miller: Lol never!
[10/10/17, 10:21:31 PM] Miller: Soccer also just as bad with concussions apparently
[10/10/17, 10:21:37 PM] Donk: Tim howard for a 2nd is the new jamaal charles for a 2nd
[10/10/17, 10:21:53 PM] Miller: I do think football is fucked longer term through
[10/10/17, 10:22:18 PM] Miller: But I'll probably move on to fantasy baseball or basketball or even hockey before going to soccer
[10/10/17, 10:22:21 PM] Brian Katz: Rugby it is then
[10/10/17, 10:22:46 PM] Brian Katz: Fantasy hockey had funny stats
[10/10/17, 10:23:07 PM] Miller: Yea my coworker did it once and tried explaining it to me it sounded fucking nuts
[10/10/17, 10:23:23 PM] Miller: Like not nearly as simple as goals and assists

[10/11/17, 1:06:22 PM] Tk: This Harvey Weinstein incident has to have a lot of Hollywood sweating. Ben Affleck released a statement condemning Harvey. Only to have 2-3 actresses come out and accuse him of doing similar acts on them.
[10/11/17, 1:07:50 PM] Miller: Bad year for people named Harvey tbh
[10/11/17, 1:09:21 PM] Launchpad: At least it's adult women. Lots of pedos in Hollywood
[10/11/17, 1:12:35 PM] Justin: Yes. Thankfully our society only suffers from a power structure that condones adult rape and harassment, as opposed to one that condones child rape.
[10/11/17, 1:14:30 PM] Brian Katz: People weren't getting raped like this when Harambe was alive......just saying
[10/11/17, 1:15:12 PM] Justin: Well deeper thought. harambe isn't around to protect children anymore, so they're next
[10/11/17, 1:15:31 PM] Brian Katz: I miss you Harambe
[10/11/17, 1:19:09 PM] Launchpad: Women can be rapists too
[10/11/17, 1:26:26 PM] Justin: Glad you feel that needed to be said
[10/11/17, 1:27:00 PM] Dan Watts: I have first hand experience
[10/11/17, 1:27:12 PM] Dan Watts: As @16195657200 knows
[10/11/17, 1:27:15 PM] Justin: Ignores the entire statement being about power structure.
[10/11/17, 1:27:31 PM] Justin: Just happens that most men are in positions of power.
[10/11/17, 1:28:23 PM] Launchpad: The power structure is a very different place at 3am
[10/11/17, 1:29:05 PM] Dan Watts: Can you identify the power structure of going into an adult establishment run by women and  being by drugged by same women and waking up to $8000 being charged on your credit card?
[10/11/17, 1:29:09 PM] Dan Watts: Asking for a friend
[10/11/17, 1:30:32 PM] Miller: Speaking first hand I think Herman can identify with that, yes
[10/11/17, 1:31:04 PM] Justin: Would assume a lawyer would understand the legal realms such an occurrence would pertain to
[10/11/17, 1:31:20 PM] Miller: Although I don't think you were drugged and I don't think it was 8k
[10/11/17, 1:36:29 PM] Justin: I mean if you enter into an illegal transaction, presumably you understand the risk that puts you at. It doesn't make it acceptable. However, The same solution exists for that problem. Enforceable laws that make the penalty for such behavior costly enough to prevent it. In the case of being drugged, defrauded, and assaulted there is plenty of legal framework to use to rectify such a situation. The criminal enterprise only shield is the shame of the victim.
[10/11/17, 1:36:51 PM] Miller: It's not illegal
[10/11/17, 1:37:24 PM] Justin: Drugging and theft is clearly illegal.
[10/11/17, 1:37:45 PM] Miller: Well nobody enters into a transaction of willingly getting drugged and robbed
[10/11/17, 1:38:00 PM] Miller: You said enter into an illegal transaction
[10/11/17, 1:38:19 PM] Justin: I'm assuming prostitution, which is clearly illegal
[10/11/17, 1:38:32 PM] Miller: Not everywhere it isn't
[10/11/17, 1:38:36 PM] Miller: Such as Mexico
[10/11/17, 1:38:39 PM] Miller: Or parts of Europe
[10/11/17, 1:39:32 PM] Justin: I mean I was answering for the direct question, but sure.
[10/11/17, 1:40:08 PM] Dan Watts: Was not prostitution
[10/11/17, 1:41:10 PM] Justin: So this person walked into strip club, was drugged, charged 8k dollars, and didn't attempt any legal remedy?
[10/11/17, 1:41:17 PM] Justin: Why not?
[10/11/17, 1:41:18 PM] Dan Watts: How does my friend prove he was drugged? All he has is anecdotal evidence that he blacked out
[10/11/17, 1:41:33 PM] Dan Watts: I'm sure he called the credit card company
[10/11/17, 1:41:39 PM] Justin: Well presumably the next day he can get tested for drugs in system
[10/11/17, 1:41:39 PM] Dan Watts: And beat the charge but still
[10/11/17, 1:41:59 PM] Justin: And that's other end of that story. Seems like a pretty dumb criminal enterprise
[10/11/17, 1:42:05 PM] Dan Watts: My friend is going to go to the hospital for the sole purpose of getting a drug test?
[10/11/17, 1:42:31 PM] Dan Watts: Once they take your bp and vitals they'll never do that
[10/11/17, 1:42:37 PM] Justin: If he believes he was drugged and defrauded?  Assuming the cc company doesn't comply, why wouldn't he?
[10/11/17, 1:43:57 PM] Justin: So a hospital  wouldn't perform a blood test they are charging the patient for?
[10/11/17, 1:45:07 PM] Dan Watts: If they see your vitals are fine they will not do a drug test
[10/11/17, 1:45:33 PM] Dan Watts: You can ask and maybe they'll do it but you pay out of pocket
[10/11/17, 1:45:38 PM] Dan Watts: So let's go further in debt
[10/11/17, 1:46:02 PM] Dan Watts: But yes let's blame the patriarchy all men are evil
[10/11/17, 1:46:12 PM] Justin: Of course it's out of pocket. Entire hospital trip is
[10/11/17, 1:46:33 PM] Justin: But if you need to prove fraud what choice do you have?
[10/11/17, 1:46:49 PM] Dan Watts: I can't believe I'm having this discussion with you
[10/11/17, 1:47:14 PM] Dan Watts: Keep viewing life from the ivory tower
[10/11/17, 1:47:17 PM] Justin: I'm just saying this isn't a legal burden. It's to prove to the cc company you were defrauded
[10/11/17, 1:47:54 PM] Justin: I mean once again, as miller aptly pointed out. I may have had a friend in a similar situation
[10/11/17, 1:49:10 PM] Justin: So not exactly sure what tower we are speaking of. If anything because the charge to my friend was more reasonable, it actually had a much higher likelihood of success
[10/11/17, 1:50:41 PM] Brian Katz: Men weren't getting drugged and defrauded when Harambe was alive.......just saying
[10/11/17, 1:51:03 PM] Justin: Beyond that rewinding back rape and harassement are a consequence of power. Men and women can abuse that power. Men tend to have that power more often, and due to society male victims tend to come out even less  than women. So both happen, both are wrong, and to correct it you need stronger more enforceable laws.
[10/11/17, 1:52:19 PM] Justin: It's moronic  to say it happens to men too, as if that has any actual relevance to the issue
[10/11/17, 1:53:20 PM] Justin: It's very similar to the I have a black friend line of reasoning.
[10/11/17, 1:53:53 PM] Brian Katz: I have a black friend herman
[10/11/17, 2:03:02 PM] Justin: Funny was just thinking about how we haven't had political argument in weeks

[10/13/17, 11:30:31 AM] Launchpad: ‚ÄúFirst of all, I can tell you that I was with a bunch of people last night watching college football, and one of the people I was with was a girl, and she mentioned ‚Äòhey, you‚Äôre getting some text message from this girl, Alyssa‚Äô to which I replied that I had asked her to meet up. After the girl scrolled through our previous texts, she mentioned that Alyssa was being a bitch to me, and wanted to go back and forth with her. (over text) I said to not do anything at all, and to not tell her anything. So then after seeing this article, and not finding the text message exchange on my phone, I reached out to the girl who then told me she had blocked and deleted her‚Ä¶ (from my phone) so I had no idea. The phone was not in my hands for that period of time last night and I can guarantee you that none of those texts are on my phone. I was extremely irate when I read this, (article written by Babe) and this is definitely not me‚Ä¶ at all, at all.‚Äù
[10/13/17, 11:30:39 AM] Miller: that was the best
[10/13/17, 11:31:00 AM] Miller: i mean who hasnt been there
[10/13/17, 11:31:03 AM] Miller: oh hey your phone keeps buzzing
[10/13/17, 11:31:54 AM] Launchpad: sure babe --> I left my phone unlocked for you so you can text whoever you want while I sit around and watch football
[10/13/17, 11:31:59 AM] Miller: oh yea no problem my passcode is 418925 its some bitch who keeps texting me she wants the D just go nuts on her for me for an hour or so? thanks
[10/13/17, 11:32:28 AM] Miller: i also suspect that guy has a VERY distinct texting style
[10/13/17, 11:33:16 AM] Launchpad: Ray Charles can detect that signature
[10/13/17, 3:03:26 PM] Miller: finished ozarks, pretty good, i would recommend it
[10/13/17, 3:46:58 PM] Justin: Blah
[10/13/17, 3:47:21 PM] Justin: Dumber over the top version breaking bad
[10/13/17, 3:47:30 PM] Justin: Just little too rediculous at times
[10/13/17, 3:48:01 PM] Launchpad: a bit over the top but it keeps the story moving
[10/13/17, 3:48:15 PM] Launchpad: BB and BCS have a tendency to be slow at times
[10/13/17, 3:48:32 PM] Miller: BB was an incredibly slow show
[10/13/17, 3:48:37 PM] Miller: you could never make that work in a 10 episode season
[10/13/17, 3:55:37 PM] Justin: Even finale was little over the top dumb. I still enjoyed it but just felt all over the place throughout most of it.
[10/13/17, 3:56:39 PM] Justin: Entire premise that some bumblefuck hicks wouldn't steal the money, as if drug dealers don't operate everyday without reporting income, was little hard to buy into
[10/13/17, 3:57:04 PM] Miller: what?
[10/13/17, 3:57:36 PM] Donk: i think he is upset about the part where the locals give the money back?
[10/13/17, 3:57:51 PM] Donk: which i thought was more about them not wanting to be murdered by the cartel than the tax implications?
[10/13/17, 3:58:00 PM] Miller: yea he bluffed them
[10/13/17, 3:58:04 PM] Miller: i thought that was fine
[10/13/17, 3:58:37 PM] Donk: i enjoyed the show
[10/13/17, 3:58:45 PM] Donk: i havent watched breaking bad,
[10/13/17, 3:59:02 PM] Donk: so the main complaint i have heard about the show being that its not as good as breaking bad means nothing to me
[10/13/17, 3:59:58 PM] Miller: yea its clearly a similarly concepted show b/c its about "normal" poeple in the drug world but i dont think theres really any similarities past that
[10/13/17, 4:00:12 PM] Donk: i still have to watch the new Mr Robot - i had no idea it was back until i saw there was a ringer article on it this week
[10/13/17, 4:00:17 PM] Miller: lots of shows are not as good as BB, doesnt mean much
[10/13/17, 4:00:41 PM] Miller: BB i would argue is a top 5 or 10 show of all time so pretty silly to start comparing every show to it
[10/13/17, 4:00:51 PM] Miller: im kind of out on Mr Robot i hated season 2
[10/13/17, 4:00:56 PM] Miller: im still gonna watch it probably
[10/13/17, 4:01:03 PM] Donk: i didnt hate it, but it was a def step down
[10/13/17, 4:01:03 PM] Miller: if only for my boy joey bada$$
[10/13/17, 4:01:12 PM] Launchpad: Mr. Robot is the shit
[10/13/17, 4:01:13 PM] Donk: they tried to hard on another gimmick
[10/13/17, 4:01:35 PM] Launchpad: I started watching the first episode but fell asleep so I didn't make it far
[10/13/17, 4:01:45 PM] Miller: ringing endorsement indeed
[10/13/17, 4:02:02 PM] Launchpad: I put it on and got into bed I was already tired
[10/13/17, 4:59:04 PM] Miller: @16313981203 @16102201963 @17189742074 spotify family question, recently my spotify keeps acting as if someone else is playing music somewhere else on my account, anyone had anything like that? Like I look in recently played and see a bunch of shit I didn't play
[10/13/17, 4:59:43 PM] Scott: have not had that issue
[10/13/17, 4:59:47 PM] Donk: i read some article a while back about people hacking spotify accounts
[10/13/17, 5:00:04 PM] Justin: Computer at home?
[10/13/17, 5:00:04 PM] Donk: the writer mostly talked about how he enjoyed what they were listening to lol
[10/13/17, 5:00:22 PM] Donk: (i also have spotify family through one of my cousins, never have had the issue)
[10/13/17, 5:00:52 PM] Miller: Both
[10/13/17, 5:01:08 PM] Scott: @miller change your password from 12345
[10/13/17, 5:01:09 PM] Miller: It shows up as someone playing some shit on spotify web player
[10/13/17, 5:01:14 PM] Miller: I checked its not Nicole
[10/13/17, 5:01:23 PM] Miller: I tried the logout of all devices
[10/13/17, 5:01:30 PM] Justin: Anyone else have access to prime account?
[10/13/17, 5:01:37 PM] Justin: Because maybe it's an Alexa thing
[10/13/17, 5:02:59 PM] Dan Watts: Have not had issue
[10/13/17, 5:03:07 PM] Launchpad: Alexa's listenin to some chunes while shes home alone during the day üòÇ
[10/13/17, 5:03:27 PM] Dan Watts: I've played weird shit like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and random house music
[10/13/17, 5:03:34 PM] Dan Watts: Is that on your recently played?
[10/13/17, 5:04:04 PM] Dan Watts: But now as you know is nothing but xxxtentacion
[10/13/17, 5:04:57 PM] Donk: hilarious that led zeppelin and pink floyd are "weird shit"
[10/13/17, 5:04:59 PM] Launchpad: who will forever be known as the dude who got knocked out on stage at his own show
[10/13/17, 5:05:14 PM] Launchpad: lol
[10/13/17, 5:05:22 PM] Donk: i have entire led zeppelin playlist on spotify lol
[10/13/17, 5:05:44 PM] Dan Watts: I remember smoking a whole bunch of weed and hot boxing that closet Wong had and listening to dark side of the moon with you fucks
[10/13/17, 5:05:46 PM] Miller: No it was some weird dance pop stuff I've never heard about and some random playlists
[10/13/17, 5:05:52 PM] Dan Watts: And I was like I'm so out on this
[10/13/17, 5:06:01 PM] Brian Katz: Maybe you Spotify is trying to play something that doesn't suck?
[10/13/17, 5:06:02 PM] Miller: I changed my password and logged out of all signed in accounts
[10/13/17, 5:06:09 PM] Donk: every time, that was the deal with the closet hot box, had to be dark side of the moon
[10/13/17, 5:06:20 PM] Donk: the blunt almost always ended on the Money jam too
[10/13/17, 5:06:35 PM] Miller: I assumed it was more of a glitch than simply someone just hacking my account but that is probably the simplest solution
[10/13/17, 5:08:04 PM] Dan Watts: Lol lol so good
[10/13/17, 5:11:28 PM] Launchpad: that was a magical place
[10/13/17, 5:11:38 PM] Launchpad: wouldnt have been the same without DSOTM
[10/13/17, 5:22:05 PM] Brian Katz: Gross
[10/13/17, 5:48:16 PM] Kiyoon: I'm not sure Millz
[10/13/17, 5:48:21 PM] Kiyoon: Maybe hacked
[10/13/17, 5:53:26 PM] Dan Watts: Looks like a guy with a beer belly
[10/13/17, 5:53:42 PM] Launchpad: thats what I thought lol
[10/13/17, 6:02:27 PM] Scott: Where do u find all of this stuff?
[10/13/17, 6:02:59 PM] Brian Katz: The internet on my commute
[10/13/17, 6:05:06 PM] Scott: Thanks lol
[10/13/17, 6:05:08 PM] Launchpad: ü§£ü§£ü§£

[10/13/17, 6:07:01 PM] Donk: Hahaha
[10/13/17, 7:01:53 PM] Tk: Hahahaha!!
[10/13/17, 7:06:59 PM] Tk: Will NE cover -9.5 at nyj? I feel like nyj always plays NE tough but everyone is picking them to cover.
[10/13/17, 7:11:58 PM] Miller: Agree jets always played them tough
[10/13/17, 7:12:10 PM] Miller: That said I think they cover
[10/13/17, 7:13:23 PM] Tk: Haha! Every so called expert is picking NE. But they did the same last week, picking Steelers n cost me out of my suicide pool.
[10/13/17, 7:13:56 PM] Tk: But yea, I'm leaning on NE.
[10/13/17, 7:35:33 PM] Brian Katz: I was at the butt fumble game. They occasionally get tea bagged
[10/13/17, 8:24:00 PM] Justin: 2nd that
[10/14/17, 7:09:54 PM] Miller: Holy shit
[10/14/17, 7:10:24 PM] Miller: Guy was dead to rights at home
[10/14/17, 7:10:31 PM] Miller: I can't believe he sent him

[10/14/17, 7:12:13 PM] Justin: cant beleive they sent him there
[10/14/17, 7:12:39 PM] Miller: I didnt see on the replay but did he have a stop sign?
[10/14/17, 7:13:04 PM] Miller: Amazing the Astros almost didn't trade for Verlander, fucking idiots
[10/14/17, 7:19:49 PM] Justin: not sure what coach told him to do
[10/14/17, 7:20:12 PM] Justin: he coudlnt see judge get to that ball before hit wall so should been on coach
[10/14/17, 7:20:36 PM] Justin: relay came in wrong as well
[10/14/17, 7:21:07 PM] Justin: runner at 2nd meaningless
[10/14/17, 7:22:38 PM] Justin: assuming you arent fuckign with fberg that 2nd trad eblongs in 1st email?
[10/14/17, 7:24:01 PM] Miller: I was supposed to be giving a 3rd not getting a 3rd, watts sent me the wrong trade
[10/14/17, 7:26:34 PM] Justin: was gonna say you really gepettoed watts with all that combine talk
[10/15/17, 8:49:05 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/russia-may-soon-issue-own-185742344.html

[10/15/17, 9:47:09 PM] Donk: Saw the new blade runner yesterday,  it was great. If you like villenueve's other movies,  youll like it
[10/15/17, 9:56:49 PM] Justin: been meaning to see it, porbaly ognna go next week
[10/15/17, 9:57:30 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/15/17, 10:06:58 PM] Launchpad: lol do you know that person??
[10/15/17, 10:07:26 PM] Miller: I do not
[10/15/17, 10:08:55 PM] Justin: something tells me she is targeting the wrong price range and clientelle
[10/15/17, 10:09:20 PM] Justin: someone shoudl reach out to her and rewrite her sales pitch
[10/15/17, 10:09:18 PM] Miller: I love everything about it
[10/15/17, 10:09:52 PM] Miller: I want a full case study done on the thought process here
[10/15/17, 10:28:43 PM] Launchpad: She could get good money for those in Japan. Hold the febreeze

[10/15/17, 10:59:49 PM] Tk: Hahaha!! He legit just made a public apology on air, 30min after that statement.
[10/15/17, 11:03:42 PM] Dan Watts: He shouldn't have to apologize
[10/15/17, 11:03:53 PM] Dan Watts: That's absurd people are so fucking sensitive
[10/15/17, 11:05:05 PM] Miller: Lol knew that was coming
[10/15/17, 11:05:43 PM] Tk: It's an NFL game. Harvey's alleged victims are women. I could understand why nbs was quick to make an apology.
[10/15/17, 11:05:52 PM] Tk: Nbc*
[10/15/17, 11:08:31 PM] Dan Watts: It wasn't like he was condoning his activities. It was a joke, we laughed.
[10/15/17, 11:12:48 PM] Tk: I def thought it was hilarious! But social media age. Once that shit goes viralon Tweeter. Nbc had to preemptively apologize.
[10/15/17, 11:15:39 PM] Justin: yeh, hilary supporters are rough
[10/15/17, 11:16:21 PM] Justin: watts you still have time to seperate yourself from those feminists and join the radical side
[10/15/17, 11:17:15 PM] Justin: defeinitely funny, clearly not a big deal, o and bviously is gonna be made as a big deal all over the news tomorrow
[10/15/17, 11:39:33 PM] Miller: I wanted to bet the giants team under this week but I couldn't find it on my site so I just bet the game under
[10/15/17, 11:39:42 PM] Miller: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[10/15/17, 11:51:45 PM] Miller: Lol John lackey loses the game pitching on consecutive days #managersaresmart
[10/16/17, 10:46:57 AM] Launchpad: it wont be the only country either
[10/16/17, 11:13:19 AM] Launchpad: lol https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/business/media/trump-twitter-bots.html
[10/16/17, 12:01:30 PM] Miller: Finished iron first, meh, not great but also not as bad as the reviews said
[10/16/17, 12:01:41 PM] Miller: On to the defenders
[10/16/17, 2:33:24 PM] Launchpad: [11:31 AM, 10/16/2017] +1 (619) 565-7200: but the reason that most people don't make any money investing is because of shitty personal limiting beliefs about wealth and money and a lack of financial education.  The idea that the stock market is for the rich is an absolute fraud


Its like me saying "whats the point of going to the gym, Im never going to bench press 500lbs so theres no point"
[10/16/17, 2:33:39 PM] Launchpad: (moved out of league chat)
[10/16/17, 2:45:54 PM] Justin: All I'm saying you have literally used the word "private" in the exact manner I did. Literally.....i have already looked back and found several times you used it.
[10/16/17, 2:47:10 PM] Justin: But I'm glad you continue to ignore financial realities, that most of the gains from the market have gone to the top 1% of wealth while silumtaneously  being at the expense of depressing wages
[10/16/17, 2:48:00 PM] Justin: Can people invest sure, can they prevent the market from lowering overall wages, no. That's a structural problem that can only be addressed via regulation
[10/16/17, 2:48:14 PM] Launchpad: lol yeah and most of the gains at the gym go to the biggest dude
[10/16/17, 2:48:29 PM] Launchpad: at some point you gotta stop crying and feeling sorry for yourself and start somewhere
[10/16/17, 2:48:37 PM] Justin: Which brings up the hypothetical that even if the 99% invested and made money, presumably it could still be negative ev
[10/16/17, 2:50:06 PM] Launchpad: there are no guarantees in life
[10/16/17, 2:50:09 PM] Justin: But we're not getting into this. Point being stop calling fake news on me
[10/16/17, 2:50:15 PM] Justin: There is a search function
[10/16/17, 2:50:19 PM] Launchpad: you can get hit by a bus tomorrow - is that going to stop you from leaving your house?
[10/16/17, 2:51:08 PM] Donk: i think big portion of it is that a large portion of americans live paycheck to paycheck and dont have the spare income to invest in the first place
[10/16/17, 2:51:11 PM] Justin: You can rape a women and get away with it, that gonna make you rape her?
[10/16/17, 2:51:41 PM] Launchpad: wtf?? completely irrelevant -- and NO
[10/16/17, 2:51:46 PM] Justin: I get your argument, analogies like that dont help it
[10/16/17, 2:51:54 PM] Justin: As is the bus comment?
[10/16/17, 2:52:35 PM] Kiyoon: A counterpoint to the gym guy, if the biggest guy in the gym has access to the best nutrition, does that make it easier for gainz???
[10/16/17, 2:52:41 PM] Justin: Your argument is correct, investing is clearly + ev over not investing
[10/16/17, 2:52:45 PM] Justin: That isn't debatable
[10/16/17, 2:53:01 PM] Miller: "nutrition" ü§£
[10/16/17, 2:53:19 PM] Donk: here we go again with calories in and calories out
[10/16/17, 2:53:22 PM] Launchpad: who cares? You shouldn't be comparing yourself to the biggest guy at the gym or the richest guy on the block
[10/16/17, 2:55:49 PM] Justin: Theoretical question lp. Do you think people would be more or less productive if they didn't have to worry about things like health care costs?
[10/16/17, 2:56:11 PM] Miller: no that was a steroid joke
[10/16/17, 3:15:34 PM] Launchpad: https://www.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/guy-fieri-cooks-thousands-of-bbq-meals-for-victims-of-the-california-wildfires-the-internet-criticizes-him-for-being-insensitive-by-using-a-smoker/?_branch_match_id=349207978409793504
[10/16/17, 3:19:52 PM] Donk: lol
[10/16/17, 3:20:06 PM] Donk: dont underestimate the amount of hate people are willing to fling at guy fieri
[10/16/17, 3:21:54 PM] Launchpad: yeah not sure if that overwhelmingly stupid being stupid or hating guy fieri for the sake of hating guy fiery
[10/16/17, 3:22:12 PM] Donk: on a side note, i really dislike barstool
[10/16/17, 3:22:20 PM] Donk: every article seems like it was written by a 7 year old
[10/16/17, 3:24:46 PM] Launchpad: Worrying about ANYTHING does not ever help anything. Its a wasted emotion that clouds judgement
[10/16/17, 4:13:37 PM] Justin: you're like the waiter in last nights curb episode.... does that mean you think they would be more productive?
[10/16/17, 4:14:02 PM] Launchpad: no spoilers I haven't seen it yet
[10/16/17, 4:14:12 PM] Launchpad: if they werent worrying sure
[10/16/17, 4:14:59 PM] Launchpad: but heres a fact: most people SAY they want X and how things aren't fair -- but they never bother to take any sort of action on it
[10/16/17, 4:16:07 PM] Launchpad: btw I think health insurance is outrageous and overpriced and wouldn't mind a state option
[10/16/17, 4:16:11 PM] Launchpad: so we're not far off
[10/16/17, 4:25:29 PM] Justin: ok so we agree the state can in fact create conditions that make people more productive, which implies the state can in fact operate in a symbiotic relationship with markets.
[10/16/17, 4:26:43 PM] Justin: you just think instead of waiting around for the state to take action, people should do it themselves...which is fair
[10/16/17, 4:27:23 PM] Launchpad: you cant help people that aren't willing to help themselves
[10/16/17, 4:27:35 PM] Justin: but we just showed you can
[10/16/17, 4:28:45 PM] Justin: perhaps that willnt make them more productive, but in theory it eliminates impedance to being more productive
[10/16/17, 4:28:46 PM] Launchpad: fair
[10/16/17, 4:29:53 PM] Miller: *FACEBOOK BUYS TBH
[10/16/17, 4:29:57 PM] Miller: saw this coming tbh
[10/16/17, 4:30:18 PM] Justin: wtf is tbh
[10/16/17, 4:30:37 PM] Miller: tbh i have no idea
[10/16/17, 4:31:04 PM] Donk: just googled it, looks like something the kids use tbh
[10/16/17, 4:31:25 PM] Launchpad: Im not against social programs. Im against people bitching about what they don't have and doing nothing about it
[10/16/17, 5:01:41 PM] Sean: To be honest
[10/16/17, 5:04:13 PM] Launchpad: is there a rest of that statement?
[10/16/17, 8:37:52 PM] Launchpad: Lol

[10/17/17, 12:00:19 PM] Miller: Happy Birthday to this wonderful guy!  We've been on so many wonderful adventures this past year.  I can't wait to plan and go on even more with you this year!  It brightens my heart to say that I've found the best travel partner, someone I can enjoy all the miles with, someone who'll help pack my clothes in a foreign country, someone who'll remember to keep my passport safe when I forget üòâ.  I love you so very much, to the moon and back!

[10/17/17, 8:22:03 PM] Miller: Gordon Hayward just had one of the worst injuries I've ever seen
[10/17/17, 8:25:42 PM] Scott: It would have been fun seeing that team play at full strength
[10/17/17, 8:26:16 PM] Donk: He'll be back i think

[10/18/17, 10:11:04 AM] Justin: http://beta.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-congress-pot-20171007-story.html
[10/18/17, 10:12:23 AM] Donk: yeah, unsurprising unfortunately
[10/18/17, 10:14:08 AM] Donk: did sessions once say that he thought the kkk was ok except that they smoked pot?
[10/18/17, 10:16:04 AM] Justin: Nah that was testimony from a minority, you can't trust those people.
[10/18/17, 1:09:02 PM] Miller: fml i try to be healthy and get a salad for lunch and they fuck the lettuce part up and i end up w/chopped kale, which i had avoided eating so far my entire life
[10/18/17, 1:09:08 PM] Miller: it is terrible
[10/18/17, 1:09:23 PM] Justin: kale>>>>>>>lettuce
[10/18/17, 1:10:07 PM] Miller: not unless they changed the meanings of those arrows
[10/18/17, 1:10:09 PM] Justin: this could be your eureka momenty
[10/18/17, 1:10:38 PM] Justin: going out on a limb and ognna say at least 70% people agree
[10/18/17, 1:10:58 PM] Kiyoon: I agree with Miller I hate Kale
[10/18/17, 1:11:13 PM] Miller: boom
[10/18/17, 1:11:30 PM] Justin: take on spinach?
[10/18/17, 1:11:38 PM] Miller: dislike
[10/18/17, 1:11:44 PM] Justin: fucken craz
[10/18/17, 1:11:52 PM] Miller: calm down popeye
[10/18/17, 1:12:00 PM] Justin: lettuce has 0 taste and its not nutritious
[10/18/17, 1:12:05 PM] Justin: just saying
[10/18/17, 1:12:16 PM] Miller: its crazy i dont enjoy something that is so bad they had to produce an entire television show to try to entice people into eating it?
[10/18/17, 1:12:55 PM] Justin: id literally eat any green over lettuce
[10/18/17, 1:13:06 PM] Justin: chard, kale spinach, arugla i dont give a fuck
[10/18/17, 1:13:36 PM] Miller: is arugula not a type of lettuce?
[10/18/17, 1:14:11 PM] Justin: i think of lettuce as iceberg and romanian
[10/18/17, 1:14:23 PM] Justin: if my defintion is too limited, perhaps im open to eating some lettuce
[10/18/17, 1:14:28 PM] Miller: yea idk, wasnt a rhetorical question i have no idea
[10/18/17, 1:14:46 PM] Miller: i know when i do create a salad it asks for lettuce type and lists iceberg, romanie, arugula, kale, spinach etc...
[10/18/17, 1:14:49 PM] Justin: i mean as far as im concrened their all lettuce
[10/18/17, 1:15:13 PM] Miller: romaine till i die
[10/18/17, 1:15:17 PM] Justin: ugh
[10/18/17, 1:15:24 PM] Miller: (which will probably be sooner than if i ate kale)
[10/18/17, 1:15:56 PM] Miller: no way McDs is using anything but romaine or icebergi n your snack wraps
[10/18/17, 1:16:56 PM] Justin: yeh but were talking a salad here
[10/18/17, 1:17:05 PM] Justin: were 90% of what im eating is the lettuce
[10/18/17, 1:17:16 PM] Justin: where*
[10/18/17, 1:17:50 PM] Kiyoon: I do like spinach but only in a moderate portion
[10/18/17, 1:18:00 PM] Kiyoon: like I couldnt have that as the base of my salad, I would mix in romaine or iceberg
[10/18/17, 1:18:19 PM] Justin: shocked miller has support on this
[10/18/17, 1:18:42 PM] Kiyoon: same thing with arugula
[10/18/17, 1:18:44 PM] Justin: i mean we may still normalize at 70% but youre killing me now kiyoon
[10/18/17, 1:18:53 PM] Kiyoon: haha sorry Herm
[10/18/17, 1:20:45 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>

[10/18/17, 1:26:26 PM] Sean: Kale is repulsive
[10/18/17, 1:26:28 PM] Miller: 3/5=66%?
[10/18/17, 1:26:39 PM] Justin: i was taking us out of it
[10/18/17, 1:26:42 PM] Brian Katz: I also like romaine too, I just prefer kale
[10/18/17, 1:26:51 PM] Miller: ah

[10/18/17, 1:27:30 PM] Justin: sean hasnt supported lettuce yet, but fair
[10/18/17, 1:27:49 PM] Sean: I‚Äôm good with ice berg or romaine
[10/18/17, 1:27:53 PM] Brian Katz: Can't all leafy greens get along?
[10/18/17, 1:27:58 PM] Sean: So are woman‚Äôs assholes

[10/18/17, 2:06:08 PM] Donk: crazy lol
[10/18/17, 2:06:54 PM] Donk: when we were first introduced to joey chemo, the kid was maybe 100lbs, which is what got him the joey chemo nickname
[10/18/17, 2:07:15 PM] Brian Katz: lol I see now

[10/19/17, 9:39:38 AM] Miller: hayward out for the year
[10/19/17, 9:40:01 AM] Brian Katz: Cavs get a pass on the east again
[10/19/17, 9:40:32 AM] Miller: tbh i say they just cancel the season and give us a best-of-82 with CLE and GSW
[10/19/17, 9:42:56 AM] Brian Katz: You mean the best of 81 or 83
[10/19/17, 9:43:38 AM] Brian Katz: Okay miller I'll bet you the NBA finals are the warriors vs the cavs
[10/19/17, 9:43:54 AM] Miller: i just said that?
[10/19/17, 9:44:02 AM] Miller: its literally like -300 @ 5d
[10/19/17, 9:44:16 AM] Brian Katz: I thought you were being sarcastic
[10/19/17, 9:44:19 AM] Brian Katz: My bad
[10/19/17, 9:44:19 AM] Miller: really going out on a limb there
[10/19/17, 9:44:30 AM] Miller: oh no there is really no point in playing out the season
[10/19/17, 9:56:38 AM] Kiyoon: just like there was no point int he NFL playing out this season with the Pats
[10/19/17, 9:56:40 AM] Kiyoon: AMIRITE???
[10/19/17, 9:56:49 AM] Miller: no youre not
[10/19/17, 9:56:54 AM] Donk: very different in basketball
[10/19/17, 9:56:55 AM] Miller: the NFL is inherently unpredictable to an extent
[10/19/17, 9:57:03 AM] Miller: the NBA is the most predictable sport in the world
[10/19/17, 9:57:07 AM] Brian Katz: It's not even close to the difference in talent in the nba
[10/19/17, 9:57:10 AM] Miller: look at the preseason top 4 east/west every season
[10/19/17, 9:57:15 AM] Miller: look at where they finish
[10/19/17, 9:57:21 AM] Miller: its like 90%+ accurate
[10/19/17, 9:57:39 AM] Miller: theres a reason vegas is literally MINUS odds on GSW winning the title
[10/19/17, 9:57:45 AM] Miller: you never see that for any favorite in the NFL
[10/19/17, 9:58:29 AM] Kiyoon: thats fine, but all you were saying before the season started was how dominant the Pats are gonna be and chalking them up as SB winners
[10/19/17, 9:58:49 AM] Brian Katz: I never said that
[10/19/17, 9:59:07 AM] Brian Katz: Football is a one a done format, so anyone can win
[10/19/17, 9:59:10 AM] Kiyoon: @15166335046
[10/19/17, 9:59:13 AM] Kiyoon: not you Katz
[10/19/17, 9:59:17 AM] Miller: screenshot me
[10/19/17, 9:59:22 AM] Miller: dont just be throwing things out there
[10/19/17, 9:59:28 AM] Kiyoon: I can't, it's too big of a thread
[10/19/17, 9:59:39 AM] Miller: well then you got nothing
[10/19/17, 9:59:46 AM] Miller: im forced to rule in my own favor
[10/19/17, 9:59:50 AM] Miller: case dismissed
[10/19/17, 9:59:50 AM] Kiyoon: I made an accusation
[10/19/17, 10:00:01 AM] Brian Katz: With no evidence
[10/19/17, 10:00:04 AM] Kiyoon: you are now forced to provide evidence of innocence
[10/19/17, 10:00:06 AM] Kiyoon: is that not how it works here
[10/19/17, 10:00:11 AM] Brian Katz: It's his word vs yours
[10/19/17, 10:00:13 AM] Kiyoon: also remember you saying that Millz
[10/19/17, 10:00:14 AM] Miller: no thats only in the court of law apparently
[10/19/17, 10:00:21 AM] Miller: did i? prove it
[10/19/17, 10:00:30 AM] Kiyoon: no man, I made the accusation
[10/19/17, 10:00:31 AM] Kiyoon: you're up
[10/19/17, 10:00:33 AM] Brian Katz: Innocent until proven guilty
[10/19/17, 10:00:40 AM] Miller: we all know kiyoons weakness is his ability to search
[10/19/17, 10:00:41 AM] Kiyoon: not in the new group chat
[10/19/17, 10:00:46 AM] Miller: just challenge anything he ever said
[10/19/17, 10:00:52 AM] Miller: he will be unable to back anything up
[10/19/17, 10:02:50 AM] Kiyoon: Steve quit over your pats arguement
[10/19/17, 10:02:53 AM] Kiyoon: quit the chat
[10/19/17, 10:03:08 AM] Miller: that is not why steve quit
[10/19/17, 10:03:11 AM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/19/17, 10:03:28 AM] Miller: he quit b/c of the fantasy lg rage quit

[10/19/17, 2:44:37 PM] Launchpad: lol
[10/19/17, 2:52:58 PM] Kiyoon: scottie you ever hear of the Gorge Ampitheatre?
[10/19/17, 2:53:27 PM] Launchpad: yeah
[10/19/17, 2:53:32 PM] Launchpad: you going to a show there?
[10/19/17, 2:53:42 PM] Launchpad: supposed to be a top venue along with Red Rocks
[10/19/17, 2:54:01 PM] Kiyoon: nah, I'm listening to a set with Above and Beyond and it looks insane
[10/19/17, 2:54:08 PM] Kiyoon: well, also kind of watching it its on youtube lol
[10/19/17, 2:54:12 PM] Launchpad: oh my friends went to that
[10/19/17, 2:54:16 PM] Kiyoon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkqnuI1SxBs
[10/19/17, 2:54:22 PM] Launchpad: I would have went if I didn't go to Europe
[10/19/17, 2:54:53 PM] Donk: Gorge is the #1 venue i have always wanted to go to
[10/19/17, 2:55:07 PM] Kiyoon: it looks amazing
[10/19/17, 2:55:47 PM] Donk: but for a real band
[10/19/17, 2:56:02 PM] Launchpad: lol
[10/19/17, 2:56:17 PM] Launchpad: for a 'real band' shut the fuck up üòÇüòÇ
[10/19/17, 2:56:21 PM] Donk: sorry, couldnt resist
[10/19/17, 2:56:26 PM] Donk: had to throw it out there
[10/19/17, 2:56:42 PM] Kiyoon: yeah put some respek on A&B
[10/19/17, 2:57:29 PM] Launchpad: thats a sweet video though with the aerial footage
[10/19/17, 2:57:38 PM] Donk: to be fair, they really arent a band per se
[10/19/17, 2:57:44 PM] Donk: they are djs
[10/19/17, 2:58:07 PM] Launchpad: to be fair, its kind of irrelevant
[10/19/17, 2:58:23 PM] Launchpad: its the old world mentality that rejects technology
[10/19/17, 2:58:45 PM] Donk: im not against electronic music
[10/19/17, 2:58:51 PM] Donk: they still arent a band though
[10/19/17, 2:58:54 PM] Launchpad: a good electronic act will find a way to make their live sets unique
[10/19/17, 2:59:17 PM] Brian Katz: Are you for electronic music?
[10/19/17, 2:59:47 PM] Kiyoon: do you consider them performers?
[10/19/17, 3:00:08 PM] Donk: yeah, they are def performers
[10/19/17, 3:00:09 PM] Launchpad: also a show like that is much more than just the music, its the whole atmosphere
[10/19/17, 3:00:12 PM] Brian Katz: The real question is what makes a band a band?
[10/19/17, 3:00:17 PM] Donk: now the extent of that performance is up to debate
[10/19/17, 3:00:25 PM] Launchpad: its an immersive experience
[10/19/17, 3:00:28 PM] Donk: what makes a band a band is actually playing instruments
[10/19/17, 3:00:39 PM] Donk: you say that as if regular bands dont do the same thing launchapd
[10/19/17, 3:00:53 PM] Brian Katz: I feel a group of musicians playing together is a band
[10/19/17, 3:00:55 PM] Donk: plenty of band bands do the whole immerseive eperience thing too
[10/19/17, 3:01:13 PM] Kiyoon: why dont you consider turntables an instrument
[10/19/17, 3:01:36 PM] Donk: no, not really
[10/19/17, 3:01:50 PM] Brian Katz: A turntable/computer technically is a musical instrument
[10/19/17, 3:02:04 PM] Miller: turntables def an instrument
[10/19/17, 3:02:06 PM] Miller: listen to some dj premier
[10/19/17, 3:02:45 PM] Kiyoon: I mean, a turntable produces a bunch of sounds, even though they are previously recorded
[10/19/17, 3:02:51 PM] Kiyoon: and then you have to mix and match
[10/19/17, 3:03:27 PM] Donk: if you want to consider a DJ a band, by all means do so, i do not
[10/19/17, 3:03:36 PM] Dan Watts: Love A&B they're playing at Barclays soon
[10/19/17, 3:03:46 PM] Brian Katz: Arrogant Donk has spoken
[10/19/17, 3:03:54 PM] Launchpad: lol
[10/19/17, 3:04:20 PM] Kiyoon: you going Watts???
[10/19/17, 3:04:27 PM] Miller: a turntable being an instrument does not make a dj a band
[10/19/17, 3:04:29 PM] Kiyoon: Donk, I will agree I am nto sure if it's a band
[10/19/17, 3:04:53 PM] Kiyoon: but its not like they arent playing "instruments"
[10/19/17, 3:05:09 PM] Donk: also, my impression from the few edm shows that i have seen is that most of it is just button pushing to start the set, and far less actualy mixing
[10/19/17, 3:05:32 PM] Donk: now producing that music in first place is def a skill, and makes you an artist
[10/19/17, 3:05:54 PM] Dan Watts: Jan 27 I'd go
[10/19/17, 3:06:31 PM] Launchpad: not this is a band I would definitely see
[10/19/17, 3:06:32 PM] Launchpad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGPOxs3HfKw
[10/19/17, 3:07:08 PM] Launchpad: skip the first 20 seconds but you can't tell me that don't look cool as fuck
[10/19/17, 3:07:32 PM] Donk: are they dressed as evil daft punk?
[10/19/17, 3:07:55 PM] Launchpad: lol not quite
[10/19/17, 3:08:03 PM] Launchpad: maybe
[10/19/17, 3:08:37 PM] Donk: tbh, thats they type of edm music i am not a fan of
[10/19/17, 3:08:38 PM] Launchpad: but they designed their own instruments to trigger samples
[10/19/17, 3:08:49 PM] Donk: daft punk is much more my speed
[10/19/17, 3:09:02 PM] Launchpad: well of course cause its too heavy, but the 'live' instrument playing part is there
[10/19/17, 3:09:59 PM] Kiyoon: i like the evil daft punk comment
[10/19/17, 3:10:03 PM] Kiyoon: pretty spot on
[10/19/17, 3:27:36 PM] Launchpad: lol
[10/19/17, 4:25:04 PM] Miller: @19732079889 i need a ruling, coworker who is a self proclaimed Os fan just said it will be sad to see todd frazier go when talking about the yankees and said he has "greatly enjoyed this playoff run"
[10/19/17, 4:25:11 PM] Miller: i think he gets immediately stripped of his Os fandom
[10/19/17, 4:25:47 PM] Brian Katz: The o's have fans?
[10/19/17, 4:26:39 PM] Donk: ugh
[10/19/17, 4:26:44 PM] Donk: get him out of here
[10/19/17, 4:26:51 PM] Donk: enjoying a yankee playoff run?
[10/19/17, 4:26:55 PM] Brian Katz: I thought they existed to lose and the people that went to the games went to see the visiting teams. Kind of like the Knicks.
[10/19/17, 4:26:58 PM] Donk: thats the worst thing i have ever heard
[10/19/17, 4:27:39 PM] Donk: i almost divorced Liz two nights ago when i watching TV downstairs and could hear her cheering for the yankees upstairs
[10/19/17, 4:27:52 PM] Miller: if he was a fan of a non-AL east time i would allow it
[10/19/17, 4:28:24 PM] Donk: maybe
[10/19/17, 4:28:25 PM] Miller: theres mets fans who just "root for NY" or some bullshit which w/e, i rooted for the yankees when they faced the phillies in the WS, but division rivals? GTFO
[10/19/17, 4:28:29 PM] Donk: better to be a NL team
[10/19/17, 4:28:38 PM] Miller: root for the dodgers
[10/19/17, 4:28:49 PM] Miller: they have kershaw and granderson and puig
[10/19/17, 4:28:57 PM] Miller: thats enough for me
[10/19/17, 4:29:59 PM] Brian Katz: You guys think the Cubs can make a comeback?
[10/19/17, 4:30:13 PM] Miller: i do not

[10/19/17, 4:30:54 PM] Brian Katz: Is that you and your mom? Lol
[10/19/17, 4:31:31 PM] Donk: its possible, the person has cleared all of their notifications
[10/19/17, 4:31:43 PM] Kiyoon: isnt that an imessage
[10/19/17, 4:31:52 PM] Kiyoon: miller is droid all the way
[10/19/17, 4:31:59 PM] Kiyoon: also I am rooting hard against the yankees in the playoffs
[10/19/17, 4:32:00 PM] Kiyoon: every year
[10/19/17, 4:32:20 PM] Miller: detective KY shows his skills
[10/19/17, 4:32:34 PM] Miller: to be fair i was not trying to pass that off as my own, didnt think anyone would assume that
[10/19/17, 4:32:52 PM] Miller: 127 unread messages? kill me
[10/19/17, 4:33:57 PM] Dan Watts: Also blue iMessage text, dead give away
[10/19/17, 4:48:59 PM] Launchpad: Oh shit, finally got a shake shack around here
[10/19/17, 4:49:29 PM] Dan Watts: In-n-out still better
[10/19/17, 4:49:32 PM] Dan Watts: And cheaper
[10/19/17, 4:49:42 PM] Miller: shake shack is meh
[10/19/17, 4:49:47 PM] Miller: the new chicken s/w is pretty good
[10/19/17, 4:49:51 PM] Miller: the concretes are great
[10/19/17, 4:49:52 PM] Miller: but food is w/e
[10/19/17, 4:50:05 PM] Miller: in n out and 5 guys and smashburger have better burgers
[10/19/17, 4:54:00 PM] Launchpad: That guys getting cut
[10/19/17, 4:55:04 PM] Donk: in n out not as good as 5 guys/smashburger/shake shack imo
[10/19/17, 4:55:10 PM] Donk: its still good
[10/19/17, 4:55:14 PM] Donk: but overhyped
[10/19/17, 4:55:27 PM] Donk: i think we have had this convo like 10 times before lol
[10/19/17, 4:55:32 PM] Launchpad: 5 guys fries are the best
[10/19/17, 4:55:42 PM] Launchpad: but we're so passionate lol
[10/19/17, 4:55:59 PM] Launchpad: its friendly disagreement without namecalling
[10/19/17, 4:56:20 PM] Donk: surprisingly lol
[10/19/17, 5:03:25 PM] Miller: in n out food wise is fine, its nothing special
[10/19/17, 5:03:34 PM] Miller: what sets it apart is the friendliness/service and the price
[10/19/17, 5:04:03 PM] Launchpad: funny how its the cheapest and their employees get paid the most
[10/19/17, 8:39:10 PM] Scott: So Michael Beasley nails a long 2 on his first shor and looks to have sprained his ankle.
[10/19/17, 8:39:15 PM] Scott: Fuckin a

[10/20/17, 5:02:47 PM] Scott: I see u following her
[10/20/17, 5:04:47 PM] Launchpad: the hookers in amsterdam were hotter
[10/20/17, 5:05:21 PM] Miller: I would hope so

[10/20/17, 5:07:51 PM] Brian Katz: I don't think watts needs to sexually assault that one
[10/20/17, 5:09:43 PM] Dan Watts: Pretty sure I'd be the #metoo in that exchange

[10/21/17, 12:27:19 AM] Miller: Usual stuff
[10/21/17, 12:47:58 AM] Justin: hahaha
[10/21/17, 12:50:22 AM] Justin: did he give you any investment advise?
[10/21/17, 12:52:03 AM] Miller: He did not
[10/21/17, 2:14:06 AM] Justin: How fucken good were your seats that you got up there

[10/21/17, 11:45:50 AM] Donk: Happy birthday james!
[10/21/17, 11:47:14 AM] Miller: Happy birthday James, I got you jordy Nelson for your birthday
[10/21/17, 11:49:11 AM] James  L: Thanks guys...
[10/21/17, 11:50:44 AM] Justin: Happy bday James
[10/21/17, 12:00:19 PM] Dan Watts: Happy bday jimbo the king
[10/21/17, 12:32:28 PM] Launchpad: Happy bday James!
[10/21/17, 1:11:32 PM] Sean: Happy Birthday!
[10/21/17, 10:39:27 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[10/21/17, 10:39:37 PM] Brian Katz: She's like get away from me
[10/22/17, 7:40:21 PM] Justin: @16195657200
[10/22/17, 7:43:48 PM] Miller: i know you didnt at me but theres a decent amount of sort of fake news in there
[10/22/17, 7:44:02 PM] Miller: 1. there is no tax plan yet, so there is no proposal to cut 401k contributions
[10/22/17, 7:44:19 PM] Justin: i mena my source is former labor secretary, so im gonna presume it isnt
[10/22/17, 7:44:32 PM] Miller: 2. if you did cut 401k PT contributions to 2400, the idea would be to shift people to using a roth account
[10/22/17, 7:44:35 PM] Launchpad: the annual limit right now is something like15k+
[10/22/17, 7:44:44 PM] Miller: which is not really a worse option necesarilly
[10/22/17, 7:44:50 PM] Miller: and can sometimes be a better option
[10/22/17, 7:45:14 PM] Justin: well if idea is to increase tax revenue, gonna say thats not likely
[10/22/17, 7:45:19 PM] Miller: its certainly not as straightforward as the TEXT ON THE PICTURE makes it seem
[10/22/17, 7:45:32 PM] Launchpad: roth IRA you pay the taxes up front
[10/22/17, 7:45:37 PM] Miller: of course the idea is to increase the tax revenue
[10/22/17, 7:45:39 PM] Miller: thats obvious
[10/22/17, 7:45:47 PM] Miller: im not saying they are doing it for the right reasons
[10/22/17, 7:46:35 PM] Justin: i mean presumably considering medium income, id say the roth would be worse decision?
[10/22/17, 7:46:39 PM] Miller: im just saying https://www.betterment.com/resources/retirement/401ks-and-iras/traditional-or-roth-401k-decide-with-this-401k-calculator/
[10/22/17, 7:46:52 PM] Justin: hurts compounding interest and your annual income is much lower in retirement
[10/22/17, 7:47:03 PM] Launchpad: its not inconceivable that they would write the law to steer people towards roth IRAs to increase current tax receipts
[10/22/17, 7:47:07 PM] Miller: generally the most obvious question is what is your tax bracket now and what do you expect your tax bracket to be later
[10/22/17, 7:47:21 PM] Miller: i had been using a roth as i expected my tax bracket to be lower in my early 20s
[10/22/17, 7:48:06 PM] Justin: which once again compared to medium income is clearly gonna hurt a majority of people
[10/22/17, 7:48:41 PM] Justin: lol median*
[10/22/17, 7:49:03 PM] Miller: the absolute income level isnt the issue, idk what the difference is b/w the median income tax bracket and the median income tax bracket at different ages/stages in life
[10/22/17, 7:50:54 PM] Miller: i used the calculator on that site as a 22 year old making 40k/yr wanting to save 5k/yr and it reccomends a roth
[10/22/17, 7:53:03 PM] Miller: so idk, this is only marginally in my wheel house, im just saying i dont think this is some kind of disaster for "middle america", if people saved before they can still save via a different vehicle and for at least some of these people using a roth would actually be a better decision, the question is how many people and how many get hurt by it, things i dont know the answer to
[10/22/17, 7:54:14 PM] Justin: fair enough
[10/22/17, 7:54:21 PM] Miller: and b/c i didnt read the entire thing originally LOL @ "deferred comp" being a tax loophole or advantage, deferred comp is a fucking disaster for anyone
[10/22/17, 7:54:39 PM] Miller: if you dont believe me, give me a % of your income every year and ill give it back to you later w/no appreciation
[10/22/17, 7:55:24 PM] Miller: you know whats better than getting money later?
[10/22/17, 7:55:25 PM] Miller: getting it now
[10/22/17, 7:55:35 PM] Justin: but thats not how the world works
[10/22/17, 7:55:43 PM] Justin: clearly thats factored into the wage
[10/22/17, 7:55:50 PM] Justin: allows for higher compensation
[10/22/17, 7:55:57 PM] Miller: i mean it is exactly how the concept of deferred comp works
[10/22/17, 7:56:03 PM] Scott: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[10/22/17, 7:56:35 PM] Justin: so your saying that most CEO;s are in fact diiots?
[10/22/17, 7:56:51 PM] Miller: just a lot of misleading borderline propaganda type language in that whole statement
[10/22/17, 7:57:00 PM] Miller: oh wow they dont have to pay taxes on it?!
[10/22/17, 7:57:05 PM] Justin: but look at what your saying
[10/22/17, 7:57:07 PM] Miller: gee is that bc they havent actually gotten the money yet
[10/22/17, 7:57:17 PM] Justin: your pretending that the time factor isnt factored into the wage
[10/22/17, 7:57:30 PM] Justin: so how is that not as misleading
[10/22/17, 7:57:29 PM] Miller: like would a statement that says people dont pay taxes on money until they receive it generate any outrage?
[10/22/17, 7:57:30 PM] Miller: probably not
[10/22/17, 7:57:34 PM] Miller: so back to the drawing board it is
[10/22/17, 7:58:17 PM] Justin: im gonna assume their is strong reasoning behind his statements with quantatative tax revenues as proof
[10/22/17, 7:58:31 PM] Justin: idk enough about any of it
[10/22/17, 7:58:41 PM] Miller: im also gonna assume there is a lot of strong reasoning behind his statement
[10/22/17, 7:59:02 PM] Justin: the deffered payment is in the form of stocks?
[10/22/17, 7:59:23 PM] Miller: it can be, it cannot be
[10/22/17, 7:59:28 PM] Miller: its just like it sounds like
[10/22/17, 7:59:31 PM] Miller: deferred compensation
[10/22/17, 7:59:36 PM] Justin: what is it mostly in the form of?
[10/22/17, 7:59:39 PM] Miller: sometimes compensation is cash
[10/22/17, 7:59:42 PM] Justin: becuase if tis mostly in stocks that would seem to matter
[10/22/17, 7:59:42 PM] Miller: sometimes it is stock
[10/22/17, 7:59:53 PM] Justin: sometimes isnt specific
[10/22/17, 8:00:16 PM] Miller: i mean i dont know the intricacies of everyones compensation
[10/22/17, 8:00:26 PM] Miller: the only deffered comp i am familiar with is in the form of cash
[10/22/17, 8:00:38 PM] Justin: stocks are clearly a huge way to leverage "actual" wealth versus theoretical wealth specifically untaxed
[10/22/17, 8:01:33 PM] Justin: as in noone would argue that Gates or buffet are worth only their liquid cash
[10/22/17, 8:02:03 PM] Justin: so if i can take millions in untaxed compensation in stocks and continually compound on that compensation...seems like that be pretty sweet fucken deal
[10/22/17, 8:02:19 PM] Miller: thats not how that works
[10/22/17, 8:02:35 PM] Justin: ok so how does it work?
[10/22/17, 8:02:44 PM] Justin: tehy get x stocks in 10 years?
[10/22/17, 8:02:51 PM] Justin: x cash in 10 years?
[10/22/17, 8:03:23 PM] Justin: ill read osme articles on it
[10/22/17, 8:03:33 PM] Miller: thats easier
[10/22/17, 8:03:38 PM] Miller: but it is not untaxed
[10/22/17, 8:04:19 PM] Justin: i know some of this had to do with clinton
[10/22/17, 8:04:23 PM] Miller: and the "compounding" implies the stock price goes up, which is an inherently risky bet, there is far from any guarantee there and unlike cash, it can go down
[10/22/17, 8:04:32 PM] Justin: and how he tried to limit compensation, but i dont know exactly what happened
[10/22/17, 8:05:08 PM] Miller: the only thing i can think you are referring to was i think they might have been able to use stock options or something to get around the TARP CEO compensation restrictions
[10/22/17, 8:05:12 PM] Miller: but im not 100% sure on that
[10/22/17, 8:05:35 PM] Justin: previous to that
[10/22/17, 8:05:52 PM] Justin: was in the 90's... pretty much clinton legislation created stock compensation
[10/22/17, 8:05:59 PM] Justin: maybe thats different thatn the deferred compensation
[10/22/17, 9:29:35 PM] Launchpad: crazy
[10/22/17, 9:30:11 PM] Miller: That would bother me every minute of every day
[10/22/17, 10:07:58 PM] Justin: I mean technically speaking that means he lost 14k, because he sure as fuck wasnt holding out past 8$
[10/22/17, 10:08:33 PM] Justin: Although I think cryptofrance guy advise nails it.
[10/22/17, 10:10:00 PM] Justin: Also may have slit his wrists back in 2011 for all we know
[10/22/17, 11:01:18 PM] Tk: New England Pat's allegedly installed fog machines to use for night games when they are leading by a significant margin.
[10/22/17, 11:03:05 PM] Brian Katz: Belicheck staying ahead of the rest of the NFL again then
[10/22/17, 11:03:32 PM] Launchpad: lol was thinking the same thing
[10/22/17, 11:05:59 PM] Tk: Yup. If it wasn't in the rule book, Bellicheck will try it.
[10/22/17, 11:06:28 PM] Brian Katz: Even if it was in the rule book he might try it
[10/22/17, 11:06:46 PM] Brian Katz: If you ain't cheating you ain't competing
[10/22/17, 11:06:53 PM] Tk: Clear as day all first half. They are up 17-0, all over sudden it's the biggest fog in history.

[10/23/17, 11:52:11 AM] Scott: lol, so how do you make money on that case if you are the lawyer?  what kind of hourly figure could someone get paid to do that?

[10/25/17, 11:46:29 AM] Dan Watts: Nah getting a gig with amazon and go to slay desperate housewives
[10/25/17, 11:46:43 AM] Kiyoon: I think it's a terrible idea
[10/25/17, 11:54:44 AM] Launchpad: why is that a terrible idea
[10/25/17, 11:54:55 AM] Launchpad: and why would you ever bet against amazon
[10/25/17, 12:00:54 PM] Kiyoon: Because what's to stop me from coming into your house and killing you
[10/25/17, 12:01:12 PM] Kiyoon: If I'm already gonna do it, I don't care if I get caught do I
[10/25/17, 12:01:18 PM] Kiyoon: On the camera*
[10/25/17, 12:01:19 PM] Launchpad: if you really wanted to do that a lock is not going to stop you
[10/25/17, 12:01:42 PM] Miller: yea i dont really think a locked door is the reason people are not getting murdered
[10/25/17, 12:01:52 PM] Launchpad: lol
[10/25/17, 12:02:11 PM] Kiyoon: Maybe murder is an extreme exmple
[10/25/17, 12:02:21 PM] Launchpad: id imagine the background checks are going to be stricter for couriers going inside houses
[10/25/17, 12:02:28 PM] Kiyoon: Are delivery drivers liable if they accidently leave your door open
[10/25/17, 12:02:31 PM] Launchpad: cable guy might murder you too
[10/25/17, 12:02:41 PM] Kiyoon: Touche
[10/25/17, 12:03:04 PM] Launchpad: do you really think amazon would roll this out without thinking out these things??
[10/25/17, 12:03:32 PM] Miller: logically i acknowledge this seems fine most likely
[10/25/17, 12:03:37 PM] Miller: still not something i would ever do
[10/25/17, 12:03:45 PM] Miller: but i also have never had any issues w/packages being stolen
[10/25/17, 12:03:53 PM] Kiyoon: Same
[10/25/17, 12:10:54 PM] Launchpad: same, but in busier areas its probably preventing thousands or even millions from getting a prime subscription
[10/25/17, 12:11:04 PM] Launchpad: so I'm going with 'brilliant' idea
[10/25/17, 12:11:15 PM] Launchpad: Bezos strikes again - this will make him the richest man in the world
[10/25/17, 12:31:37 PM] Kiyoon: I didnt think busier areas is what would prevent someone from getting a subcription
[10/25/17, 12:31:44 PM] Kiyoon: i would think higher crime areas

[10/26/17, 9:43:32 AM] Miller: https://www.metro.us/news/update-collegehumor-buys-n-h-man-s-stuffed-banana-for-2-600-after-embarassing-carnival-game-loss/tmWmef---24q6m4C8LHwf2
[10/26/17, 9:43:35 AM] Miller: looks like it worked out for himn
[10/26/17, 9:47:27 AM] Miller: http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6888039/we-are-the-proud-owners-of-a-2600-stuffed-banana
[10/26/17, 9:48:06 AM] Miller: lol this guy thinks hes setting up college funds for 3 kids (and donating money to a charity) all with $2600
[10/26/17, 9:48:29 AM] Miller: exactly the kind of sound financial thinking i would expect from someone who spent his last $2600 at a carnival to try to win an xbox and got a giant banana
[10/26/17, 9:50:39 AM] Brian Katz: It was a Kinect an attachment to the Xbox
[10/26/17, 9:50:58 AM] Miller: unclear
[10/26/17, 9:51:14 AM] Miller: some articles said xbox kinect (like the bundle) and some said kinect for the xbox
[10/26/17, 9:51:32 AM] Miller: and collegehumor gave him a whole xbox w/kinect
[10/26/17, 9:51:44 AM] Brian Katz: And at what point do you give up and declare the game not winnable?
[10/26/17, 9:52:39 AM] Donk: 10 dollars deep?
[10/26/17, 9:52:45 AM] Donk: maybe?
[10/26/17, 9:53:08 AM] Kiyoon: I'd go $20
[10/26/17, 9:53:20 AM] Miller: yea ive wasted $20 on stupider things
[10/26/17, 9:53:41 AM] Miller: hes also dumb b/c that game is an actual scam
[10/26/17, 9:53:41 AM] Donk: wow, you ballers trying to show me up with your twenty spots?
[10/26/17, 9:54:59 AM] Kiyoon: üëèüëèüí∏üí∏üí∏
[10/26/17, 9:55:12 AM] Kiyoon: I'm trying to make it rain, not sure if I captured that
[10/26/17, 9:55:18 AM] Miller: having randomly been to a bunch of these type places this summer w/evan i really appreciate the ones that let the kids either play until they win or give them a prize no matter what
[10/26/17, 9:55:26 AM] Miller: obviously its a POS but he doesnt care
[10/26/17, 9:56:23 AM] Donk: yeah, thats seems like good business sense to me
[10/26/17, 9:56:44 AM] Miller: the problem is evan always wants to do the basketball one, which besides being difficult for even a expert marksman like myself, is too high/far away from him to even make an attempt, so im literally just there handing this guy money so evan can take the ball and throw it 2ft
[10/26/17, 9:57:01 AM] Donk: lol
[10/26/17, 9:57:08 AM] Miller: on the plus side he likes skee ball and he only gets the ball up over the ramp like 1/2 the time, so 50c on skeeball lasts him like 20 minutes
[10/26/17, 9:58:14 AM] Miller: i was killing it last time we went, i went 2/2 on the basketball shots and i even got one of those frog flipping hammer things onto the pad
[10/26/17, 10:04:44 AM] James  L: I bagged like 15 goldfish the last carnivals I went to and they died within a week
[10/26/17, 10:06:11 AM] Miller: thats honestly better than the alternative
[10/26/17, 10:06:21 AM] Miller: a friend of mine won one of those and he lived for like 15 years
[10/26/17, 10:06:32 AM] Miller: gotta buy a tank, food, whole nonsense
[10/26/17, 10:06:42 AM] James  L: Hahah I had to go buy a tank and shit and food
[10/26/17, 10:07:08 AM] Miller: pfft
[10/26/17, 10:07:15 AM] Brian Katz: I did a test of strength at the feast, and got on the mid 90‚Äôs as a free try. I paid for it and when I hit the target with the mallet it was like hitting cement and it blew off my watch. Needless to say I got a 79 the second try.
[10/26/17, 10:08:30 AM] Launchpad: lol they got you with the bait and switch
[10/26/17, 10:09:42 AM] Launchpad: I did the basketball one a few years ago and managed to make the shot.  After I collected my prize and was walking away, I walked around the side and noticed how small and narrow that shot was but in front it looks completely normal
[10/26/17, 10:09:43 AM] Brian Katz: For sure
[10/26/17, 10:10:06 AM] Miller: yea the rims are oval
[10/26/17, 10:10:11 AM] Miller: but you cant tell from the front view
[10/26/17, 10:10:34 AM] Miller: and the 3pt shot ones are like 11ft high vs normal 10ft
[10/26/17, 10:12:13 AM] Miller: i almost got rasatafarian banana'd when i was like 12 i was at a carnival and did the basketball one and made my 1st shot and won a mini-basketball and then when i tried to win another one i ended up spending like $20 before i hit another one
[10/26/17, 10:17:14 AM] Launchpad: martavis just got rastafarian banana'd
[10/26/17, 10:29:48 AM] Tk: Girardi out as mgr
[10/26/17, 10:30:03 AM] Brian Katz: They fired him?
[10/26/17, 10:30:03 AM] Miller: wow
[10/26/17, 10:30:09 AM] Miller: stupid move
[10/26/17, 10:30:17 AM] Miller: would have liked him on the mets, but that ship has sailed
[10/26/17, 10:45:43 AM] Tk: Both sides couldn't agree. Basically firing him w dignity.
[10/26/17, 10:46:54 AM] Donk: yeah, its weird as sometimes i thought he made terrible decisons regarding the bullpen
[10/26/17, 10:47:12 AM] Donk: yet, his team has outpeformed projections year after year after year
[10/26/17, 10:47:26 AM] Donk: hes def a good manager
[10/26/17, 10:47:55 AM] Launchpad: bring back Don Mattingly!!
[10/26/17, 10:48:30 AM] Donk: why?
[10/26/17, 10:48:50 AM] Miller: thats just the only other baseball player whose name he knows
[10/26/17, 10:48:55 AM] Donk: and hes under contract anyway
[10/26/17, 10:49:07 AM] Launchpad: not just any player, my all time favorite baseball player growing up
[10/26/17, 10:49:36 AM] Donk: yeah, thats a terrible reason to hire someone as a manager
[10/26/17, 10:49:49 AM] Launchpad: no its an amazing reason
[10/26/17, 10:50:05 AM] Donk: im tyring to imagine LT as coach of the giants
[10/26/17, 10:50:12 AM] Donk: its not going well in my head
[10/26/17, 10:50:27 AM] Launchpad: "We've just hired long time Yankee great Don Mattingly, at the request of some schmuck in San Deigo who used to collect his baseball cards"
[10/26/17, 10:50:52 AM] Launchpad: ummmmm Don Mattingly did not smoke crack and solicit underage prostitutes
[10/26/17, 10:50:57 AM] Donk: (though LT is not my favorite all time giant, that would be strahan, its just more entertaining to picture LT as coach)
[10/26/17, 10:51:45 AM] Donk: you dont know that, all we know is that he hasnt been caught doing it
[10/26/17, 10:52:27 AM] Launchpad: ^^ the kind of guy I want managing my team
[10/26/17, 11:07:40 AM] Brian Katz: He had to be retired before you were 10
[10/26/17, 11:07:59 AM] Launchpad: 12
[10/26/17, 11:08:27 AM] Brian Katz: What year were you born?
[10/26/17, 11:12:04 AM] Launchpad: 84
[10/26/17, 2:05:54 PM] Donk: Haribo uses slave labor apparently
[10/26/17, 2:05:58 PM] Donk: so sad
[10/26/17, 2:09:05 PM] Launchpad: You think that's bad? Check this out
[10/26/17, 2:09:57 PM] Donk: yeah, that meme has basically been around since before there were memes
[10/26/17, 2:10:16 PM] Donk: longstanding joke about luke committing genocide
[10/26/17, 3:32:07 PM] Donk: sweet, american vandal is coming back for season 2
[10/26/17, 3:32:11 PM] Donk: maybe we can find out who actually drew the dicks
[10/26/17, 3:32:17 PM] Scott: was it really that good?
[10/26/17, 3:32:22 PM] Scott: only watched a few episodes
[10/26/17, 3:32:30 PM] Donk: surprisingly entertaining
[10/26/17, 3:32:36 PM] Miller: it was good
[10/26/17, 3:32:45 PM] Miller: how do you not finish an 8 episode season
[10/26/17, 3:33:01 PM] Donk: they did such a great job nailing all of the beats from the crime-investigation shows
[10/26/17, 3:33:09 PM] Donk: it was very well done
[10/26/17, 3:33:17 PM] Donk: and only 8 half hour episodes at that
[10/26/17, 3:33:24 PM] Miller: they also nailed every stereotypical HS person
[10/26/17, 3:33:30 PM] Miller: but not cheesy tv trope
[10/26/17, 3:33:45 PM] Miller: ill watch season 2
[10/26/17, 3:33:49 PM] Miller: hope its better than season 2 of serial
[10/26/17, 3:34:02 PM] Scott: i will finish it at some point
[10/26/17, 3:34:25 PM] Donk: cheese is too busy for it
[10/26/17, 3:34:27 PM] Donk: he doesnt care
[10/26/17, 3:34:28 PM] Miller: no rush, you got a lot on your plate with crushing life and everything, take your time
[10/26/17, 3:35:06 PM] Scott: omg stop it lol
[10/26/17, 3:35:45 PM] Launchpad: spoiler alert, thanks dickhead
[10/26/17, 3:36:09 PM] Scott: wow
[10/26/17, 3:36:17 PM] Scott: actually i didn't realize u just spoiled it you asshole
[10/26/17, 3:36:21 PM] Miller: lol
[10/26/17, 3:36:32 PM] Miller: the spoilee has become the spoiler
[10/26/17, 3:38:43 PM] Donk: i mean, not really a spoiler
[10/26/17, 3:38:49 PM] Donk: they give you the best guess on who they thought did it
[10/26/17, 3:38:55 PM] Donk: and i didnt spoil that
[10/26/17, 3:39:06 PM] Donk: but yeah, my bad, sorry
[10/26/17, 3:39:28 PM] Scott: More spoilers
[10/26/17, 3:39:28 PM] Launchpad: r u rly tho?
[10/26/17, 3:39:33 PM] Donk: i spoiled the fact that you dont get a definitive answer
[10/26/17, 3:39:48 PM] Donk: i am, never like to spoil anything for anyone
[10/26/17, 3:40:13 PM] Launchpad: in a way its kind of predictable because if its based on Making a Murderer, you never do find out who really killed the girl
[10/26/17, 3:40:28 PM] Miller: .......he did
[10/26/17, 3:40:34 PM] Donk: yeah, same with serial or any of the other ones
[10/26/17, 3:40:39 PM] Miller: he also did
[10/26/17, 3:40:40 PM] Donk: except the jinx
[10/26/17, 3:40:44 PM] Donk: you find out what happens in the jinx
[10/26/17, 3:40:51 PM] Miller: that one i havent seen yet
[10/26/17, 3:40:59 PM] Donk: oh, thats the best one
[10/26/17, 3:41:03 PM] Miller: but i know the twist already
[10/26/17, 3:41:07 PM] Donk: out of all of them, its the one i would recommend first
[10/26/17, 3:41:07 PM] Miller: was impossible to avoid
[10/26/17, 3:41:21 PM] Miller: so ive been putting off watching it
[10/26/17, 3:41:23 PM] Donk: yeah, it was major news
[10/26/17, 3:41:26 PM] Miller: not sure it will be as good
[10/26/17, 3:41:39 PM] Miller: plus my TV backlog is fucking insane so theres that
[10/26/17, 3:41:52 PM] Launchpad: tv + video games
[10/26/17, 3:41:53 PM] Donk: i think everyone is bascially at that point now
[10/26/17, 3:42:02 PM] Donk: way too much content
[10/26/17, 3:42:13 PM] Launchpad: daylight savings signifies the start of video game season
[10/26/17, 3:42:18 PM] Launchpad: new South Park game is out
[10/26/17, 3:42:21 PM] Miller: i get overwhelmed when bachelor in paradise hits me with their 4 hours of week of programming
[10/26/17, 3:42:38 PM] Miller: combined with that period where 1 real housewives is ending and another 1 is beginning
[10/26/17, 3:42:58 PM] Miller: then if i dont get those done in time fall comes and everything else starts back up
[10/26/17, 3:43:04 PM] Miller: and then football starts
[10/26/17, 3:43:04 PM] Donk: speaking of the housewives, its fucking abusrd that they have three part reunions now
[10/26/17, 3:43:09 PM] Miller: and i spend /12 my week watching football
[10/26/17, 3:43:11 PM] Launchpad: new episode of mr robot is out
[10/26/17, 3:43:28 PM] Donk: all new everything
[10/26/17, 3:43:36 PM] Miller: im still 4 behind on suits, 3 behind in mr robot, 3 behind in arrow/flash, 5 behind in american horror story, and the latest walking dead
[10/26/17, 3:43:50 PM] Miller: and havent seen the "new" season of OITNB yet
[10/26/17, 3:44:01 PM] Miller: and i have 4 housewives on the DVR still
[10/26/17, 3:44:04 PM] Miller: maybe 5
[10/26/17, 3:44:06 PM] Launchpad: the new season was one of the best ones of OITNB
[10/26/17, 3:44:14 PM] Miller: its too much man
[10/26/17, 3:44:20 PM] Launchpad: i need a gf so I can catch up on tv and video games
[10/26/17, 3:44:27 PM] Miller: also never saw the new homeland season
[10/26/17, 3:44:55 PM] Miller: and at some pt i want to watch this defneders but that i can watch w/o nicole so commuting TV is easier to catch up on
[10/26/17, 3:45:24 PM] Miller: probably will watch nothing and spend the weekend watching football and old episodes of nathan for you
[10/26/17, 3:45:34 PM] Donk: commuting tv/commuting reading is the main reason i cant wait for self driving cars
[10/26/17, 3:45:39 PM] Launchpad: still havent seen GoT yet
[10/26/17, 3:45:52 PM] Miller: spoiler alert theres dragons
[10/26/17, 3:45:53 PM] Launchpad: for now we will have to settle for listening to books while driving
[10/26/17, 3:46:00 PM] Launchpad: fuuuuuuuck
[10/26/17, 3:46:04 PM] Donk: eh, im not an audiobook guy
[10/26/17, 3:46:08 PM] Miller: listening to books while driving would put me to sleep
[10/26/17, 3:46:23 PM] Miller: which is not ideal if you are driving
[10/26/17, 3:46:30 PM] Launchpad: you could always opt for the tim ferris podcast
[10/26/17, 3:46:41 PM] Miller: then i might willingly drive into a pole
[10/26/17, 3:46:43 PM] Donk: i do podcast every now and then
[10/26/17, 3:46:59 PM] Donk: but mostly, sports talk radio in the mornings, and then either more of that or music on the way home
[10/26/17, 3:47:14 PM] Donk: my commute is less than a half hour, so its not like its that much time in the car
[10/26/17, 3:47:21 PM] Miller: i "listen" to podcasts commuting but mostly just fall asleep with them on
[10/26/17, 3:47:38 PM] Scott: a gf helps you catch up on video games?
[10/26/17, 3:47:54 PM] Donk: of course
[10/26/17, 3:47:57 PM] Miller: currently on a rotation of VORW and nosleep (ironically titled b/c it does in fact put me to sleep)
[10/26/17, 3:48:02 PM] Scott: how?
[10/26/17, 3:48:11 PM] Donk: because you spend more time at home
[10/26/17, 3:48:15 PM] Donk: and less time chasing chicks
[10/26/17, 3:48:20 PM] Launchpad: need something to do when shes not around and Im not trying to lay the pipe in some strange
[10/26/17, 3:49:09 PM] Donk: also, generally gfs/wives go to sleep earlier
[10/26/17, 3:49:18 PM] Launchpad: lol
[10/26/17, 3:49:18 PM] Donk: which means more time to play video games after they fall asleep
[10/26/17, 3:49:25 PM] Donk: vs being out at the bar at 2am
[10/26/17, 3:49:58 PM] Donk: do you disagree with my go to sleep earlier theory?
[10/26/17, 3:50:34 PM] Launchpad: not at all
[10/26/17, 3:54:29 PM] Miller: i generally go to sleep earlier than nicole
[10/26/17, 3:54:35 PM] Miller: during the week
[10/26/17, 3:55:38 PM] Donk: did you when she was still teaching?
[10/26/17, 3:55:55 PM] Miller: i would say we went to bed at the same time then
[10/26/17, 3:56:23 PM] Donk: yeah
[10/26/17, 3:56:28 PM] Donk: ok, so maybe not a true rule
[10/26/17, 3:56:41 PM] Launchpad: well...extenuating circumstances
[10/26/17, 4:41:21 PM] Launchpad: http://digg.com/2017/tv-host-paqui-chip-challenge
[10/26/17, 4:43:22 PM] Donk: haha, oh man
[10/26/17, 4:43:33 PM] Donk: i like spicy food, but not fucking with ghost peppers
[10/26/17, 4:43:51 PM] Donk: at some point its just not enjoyable
[10/26/17, 4:46:42 PM] Brian Katz: Ive fucked with ghost peppers before......don‚Äôt ever duck with ghost peppers
[10/26/17, 4:48:38 PM] Launchpad: did I ever show you guys my taco challenge video?
[10/26/17, 4:48:51 PM] Launchpad: I gotta dig that up and post it
[10/26/17, 4:48:57 PM] Launchpad: i got fucked up
[10/26/17, 4:56:54 PM] Miller: That was Carolina reaper, way worse than ghost pepper
[10/26/17, 4:57:11 PM] Miller: I saw that video yesterday which was when I wanted to try to get launchpad to do it
[10/26/17, 4:57:35 PM] Miller: Her biggest mistake was drinking the coffee though
[10/26/17, 4:58:10 PM] Launchpad: sounds aweful
[10/26/17, 4:58:15 PM] Launchpad: cant do that without a glass of milk on hand
[10/26/17, 4:58:24 PM] Launchpad: thats the lesson I learned from the taco challenge
[10/26/17, 4:58:33 PM] Launchpad: I drank a pitcher of water afterwards and puked it all up
[10/26/17, 8:03:47 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm sitting in the quiet car and some guy is talking on his phone to his girl. The guy sitting in front of him got up called him a fucking Jew and changed cars. It was quite shocking.
[10/26/17, 8:04:20 PM] Miller: Was he speaking Hebrew?
[10/26/17, 8:04:35 PM] Brian Katz: No
[10/26/17, 8:04:43 PM] Miller: You missed a golden opportunity
[10/26/17, 8:04:45 PM] Brian Katz: But it was confirmed he was Jewish
[10/26/17, 8:05:01 PM] Miller: When the guy said that you should have told him to keep it down, it's the quiet car
[10/26/17, 8:05:56 PM] Brian Katz: I was is shock but you‚Äôre right I should‚Äôve trolled the irrational bigot on the lirr lol
[10/26/17, 8:06:14 PM] Miller: His head would have exploded
[10/26/17, 8:39:48 PM] Kiyoon: Saw some shit about two guys owning a taco shop yelling antisemetic shit at  someone in south VA on video
[10/26/17, 8:40:03 PM] Kiyoon: Can't beleive this shit happens in 2017
[10/26/17, 8:42:26 PM] Miller: It's 2017 racism is back in style
[10/26/17, 9:13:15 PM] Miller: Wtf is wrong with people who put pizza on a pineapple
[10/26/17, 9:13:18 PM] Miller: So weird
[10/26/17, 9:14:53 PM] James  L: I love the Hawaiian pizza
[10/26/17, 9:15:21 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/26/17, 9:15:44 PM] James  L: It's all about the salty and sweet
[10/26/17, 9:48:09 PM] Tk: Elite!!!üòÜüòÜ
[10/26/17, 9:49:17 PM] Miller: You have the worst team in the history of the NFL no idea how you win any games lol
[10/26/17, 9:52:46 PM] Tk: I already answered. We have mister Elite. 31st in QB rating this week is all fake news. Alternative facts!!
[10/26/17, 10:03:45 PM] Kiyoon: Mr Elite is dead
[10/26/17, 10:05:08 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[10/26/17, 10:05:25 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[10/26/17, 10:43:10 PM] Scott: Going on a 4th date with a doctor whose concern post date is picking up empty capsules to do ecstasy on Saturday...#cheesedealbreaker
[10/26/17, 10:43:34 PM] Justin: send her to LP
[10/26/17, 10:44:35 PM] Miller: Why do you need empty capsules for ecstacy?
[10/26/17, 10:44:35 PM] Launchpad: Tbh sounds like a way better night then a random date
[10/26/17, 10:44:41 PM] Launchpad: Molly
[10/26/17, 10:44:56 PM] Launchpad: Not e pill but Molly powder
[10/26/17, 10:45:38 PM] Miller: She waited the standard 4 dates

[10/26/17, 10:46:14 PM] Miller: How hard can finding empty capsules be?
[10/26/17, 10:46:29 PM] Scott: Not at the bodegas she tried.
[10/26/17, 10:46:56 PM] Scott: I honestly thought it was a joke at first. Came out of nowhere.
[10/26/17, 10:47:02 PM] Launchpad: Buy a fucken bottle of Tylenol gel caps lol
[10/26/17, 10:47:21 PM] Miller: Just weird because I don't see why empty capsules would be illegal
[10/26/17, 10:47:27 PM] Miller: Like order 1000 from Amazon

[10/26/17, 10:50:28 PM] Scott: As would u
[10/26/17, 10:50:43 PM] Scott: What if it was Taylor swift wanting to do molly?

[10/27/17, 1:00:28 PM] Justin: Other than the fact that I get some stupid adware pop up, what is more rediculous...some random professor abusing language and political correctness to make bogus conclusions that literally no one would know about...or spreading that nonsense to millions of people as sensationalized news and pretending as if that somehow dismisses an actual system of oppression?
[10/27/17, 1:01:20 PM] Justin: That's rhetorical btw so the answer to katz is sure why not
[10/27/17, 1:01:33 PM] Justin: Although I'd want to know the penalty for public nudity first

[10/27/17, 4:42:26 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm going T2
[10/27/17, 4:42:36 PM] Miller: T2 is in fact the correct answer
[10/27/17, 4:42:49 PM] Justin: aliens pretty solid
[10/27/17, 4:42:52 PM] Scott: T2?
[10/27/17, 4:42:58 PM] Miller: T-2
[10/27/17, 4:43:02 PM] Brian Katz: Had this argument with someone at work
[10/27/17, 4:43:18 PM] Justin: best third movie is die hard
[10/27/17, 4:43:30 PM] Miller: Rocky 3 > die hard
[10/27/17, 4:43:31 PM] Brian Katz: Return of the Jedi
[10/27/17, 4:43:53 PM] Miller: tbh i pity the fool who thinks die hard is the best threequel
[10/27/17, 4:43:53 PM] Brian Katz: Also rocky 3
[10/27/17, 4:44:20 PM] Brian Katz: Lord of the rings the return of the king is better
[10/27/17, 4:44:35 PM] Justin: figured someone would say that
[10/27/17, 4:45:41 PM] Miller: i liked the LOTR movies (esp 2) but i dont think they would be on any of my ."...of all time lists"
[10/27/17, 4:45:51 PM] Miller: (well unless were doing a best fantasy epic movie of all time)
[10/27/17, 4:45:53 PM] Justin: but it did win an oscar
[10/27/17, 4:46:02 PM] Brian Katz: Better than die hard  with a vengeance
[10/27/17, 4:46:05 PM] Miller: think i give a fuck about an oscar?
[10/27/17, 4:46:20 PM] Miller: i think the migos won an oscar
[10/27/17, 4:46:31 PM] Donk: its Empire Strikes Back
[10/27/17, 4:46:43 PM] Justin: die hard with a vengance is literraly the end of an era
[10/27/17, 4:46:57 PM] Brian Katz: They made two more
[10/27/17, 4:47:09 PM] Miller: the end of good die hard movies?
[10/27/17, 4:47:18 PM] Donk: Aliens also good
[10/27/17, 4:47:27 PM] Justin: nah action movies genre
[10/27/17, 4:47:26 PM] Donk: lots of good choices tbh
[10/27/17, 4:47:28 PM] Brian Katz: Aliens my second fave
[10/27/17, 4:47:43 PM] Miller: blashpehmy
[10/27/17, 4:47:50 PM] Justin: within 2-3 years
[10/27/17, 4:47:49 PM] Donk: T2, Empire, Aliens all have to be up there
[10/27/17, 4:47:52 PM] Justin: nothing
[10/27/17, 4:47:53 PM] Miller: tons of good if not great action movies post die hard
[10/27/17, 4:48:00 PM] Donk: indy and the last crusade also gotta be up there
[10/27/17, 4:48:11 PM] Donk: (and not to mention that temple of doom is underrated, but not as good as last crusade)
[10/27/17, 4:48:22 PM] Brian Katz: There were still two more die hard movies which I believe were in the action genre made after vengeance
[10/27/17, 4:48:41 PM] Justin: sure as fuck no good action movie sequels
[10/27/17, 4:48:48 PM] Justin: couple stand alone movie with nicolas cage
[10/27/17, 4:48:55 PM] Justin: than a generation of shitty rock movies
[10/27/17, 4:48:56 PM] Miller: i couldnt even finish the last die hard
[10/27/17, 4:48:56 PM] Miller: so bad
[10/27/17, 4:49:04 PM] Justin: as in dqayne johnson
[10/27/17, 4:49:06 PM] Brian Katz: Crusade best 3rd installment
[10/27/17, 4:49:15 PM] Miller: Fast 5,6,7, and 8 disagree with you
[10/27/17, 4:49:23 PM] Justin: see above
[10/27/17, 4:49:30 PM] Brian Katz: Dqwayne johnso cousin of Dwayne
[10/27/17, 4:49:31 PM] Miller: doesnt mean you arent wrong
[10/27/17, 4:49:47 PM] Justin: yeh, the rock blasting a car into space totally awesome action movie
[10/27/17, 4:50:04 PM] Justin: not built for a generation of kids that have extreme adention deficit
[10/27/17, 4:50:04 PM] Miller: fast 5 >>>
[10/27/17, 4:50:08 PM] Justin: attention *
[10/27/17, 4:50:11 PM] Donk: Spiderman 2 also dope
[10/27/17, 4:50:12 PM] Miller: what are you talking about?
[10/27/17, 4:50:12 PM] Brian Katz: What are all the marvel movies considered?
[10/27/17, 4:50:15 PM] Donk: and X-2 for that matter
[10/27/17, 4:50:17 PM] Miller: now this is a millenial rant?
[10/27/17, 4:50:30 PM] Justin: im saying the fast and furious series blows
[10/27/17, 4:50:36 PM] Brian Katz: What about the raid? Way better action movie than die hard 3
[10/27/17, 4:50:38 PM] Miller: well thats youre opinion
[10/27/17, 4:50:40 PM] Justin: great first movie
[10/27/17, 4:50:40 PM] Miller: its wrong
[10/27/17, 4:50:42 PM] Miller: but its your opinion
[10/27/17, 4:50:47 PM] Donk: if Mad Max Fury Road counts as a sequel, add that to the list
[10/27/17, 4:51:01 PM] Donk: to me its borderline a reboot vs a sequel though
[10/27/17, 4:51:12 PM] Brian Katz: Those movies stink until the rock shows up
[10/27/17, 4:51:15 PM] Miller: imagine being too pretentious to enjoy the fast and furious movies?
[10/27/17, 4:51:24 PM] Donk: 8 was great
[10/27/17, 4:51:27 PM] Donk: wasnt i mean
[10/27/17, 4:51:28 PM] Brian Katz: Super dope
[10/27/17, 4:51:30 PM] Justin: look 1 or two were fine
[10/27/17, 4:51:30 PM] Donk: nor was 7
[10/27/17, 4:51:34 PM] Donk: but 5 and 6 i like
[10/27/17, 4:51:35 PM] Donk: and 1 too
[10/27/17, 4:51:41 PM] Miller: 7 was sick
[10/27/17, 4:51:52 PM] Donk: 4 i thought was terrible
[10/27/17, 4:51:54 PM] Donk: nothing happens in that movie
[10/27/17, 4:51:58 PM] Justin: couldnt possibly distinguish the plot from 5 on
[10/27/17, 4:52:02 PM] Miller: 4 everyone agrees is terrible
[10/27/17, 4:52:13 PM] Miller: imagine not being able to follow the plot of a movie made for idiots with ADD?
[10/27/17, 4:52:28 PM] Justin: genreal rule of thumb, if you can make 8 movies about something------they will likely suck
[10/27/17, 4:52:37 PM] Miller: rocky says your wrong
[10/27/17, 4:53:03 PM] Brian Katz: Those are all good
[10/27/17, 4:53:13 PM] Miller: all but the first 90 min of 5
[10/27/17, 4:53:31 PM] Justin: ill agree stallone breaks that rule
[10/27/17, 4:53:31 PM] Brian Katz: That one is underrated
[10/27/17, 4:53:35 PM] Donk: i do surprisingly enjoy all of the rocky movies
[10/27/17, 4:53:39 PM] Miller: but 6 and 7 are so much better than they have any right to be
[10/27/17, 4:53:46 PM] Donk: 5 is the worst one, but has the best line "I aint hear no bell"
[10/27/17, 4:53:57 PM] Justin: sue me for what
[10/27/17, 4:53:58 PM] Miller: its funny how different 1 is compared to 3 or 4
[10/27/17, 4:54:00 PM] Miller: its not even a boxing movie
[10/27/17, 4:54:05 PM] Donk: and creed was great too
[10/27/17, 4:54:18 PM] Miller: i have been considering creed rocky 7 for the purpose of this discussion
[10/27/17, 4:54:38 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs rocky reboot really
[10/27/17, 4:54:46 PM] Justin: im gonna assume stallone wrote 1-6
[10/27/17, 4:54:47 PM] Donk: though by hermans theory, if the make an 8th one, it will suck
[10/27/17, 4:54:52 PM] Donk: he did specify 8 movies
[10/27/17, 4:54:57 PM] Miller: yea ill take my chances
[10/27/17, 4:55:08 PM] Brian Katz: He wrote all of them I think
[10/27/17, 4:55:10 PM] Miller: he did also then immediately exclude stallone from that
[10/27/17, 4:55:18 PM] Justin: he didnt write creed, might have helped write it
[10/27/17, 4:55:20 PM] Miller: leaving basically no other franchises in his theoretical example
[10/27/17, 4:55:30 PM] Justin: guy who directed frutavale wrote it i think
[10/27/17, 4:55:38 PM] Donk: ryan coogler
[10/27/17, 4:55:42 PM] Brian Katz: What?
[10/27/17, 4:55:46 PM] Donk: black panther looks awesome btw
[10/27/17, 4:55:50 PM] Miller: he didnt write all the rocky movies either
[10/27/17, 4:55:51 PM] Donk: fruitvale station is what herman meant
[10/27/17, 4:56:04 PM] Miller: apparently hes directing creed 2
[10/27/17, 4:56:09 PM] Brian Katz: Rambo 4 was dope
[10/27/17, 4:56:20 PM] Justin: staollne directing creed 2?
[10/27/17, 4:56:23 PM] Donk: confession time, i have never seen any of the rambo movies
[10/27/17, 4:56:26 PM] Brian Katz: Stallone hits his stride at movie 4
[10/27/17, 4:56:26 PM] Donk: its a gap
[10/27/17, 4:56:39 PM] Brian Katz: Watch them they‚Äôre dope
[10/27/17, 4:56:59 PM] Brian Katz: Alls he wanted was something to eat
[10/27/17, 4:57:15 PM] Justin: smae kind of thing as rocky in that 1st one is different form others
[10/27/17, 4:57:45 PM] Justin: stallone a genius and a great writer
[10/27/17, 4:58:05 PM] Miller: also same kind of thing as rocky b/c the last rambo like 30 yrs after the original was against all odds, fucking awesome
[10/27/17, 4:58:15 PM] Donk: the one movie stallone movie which deserved a sequal was demolition man
[10/27/17, 4:58:24 PM] Donk: in retrospect, kinda shcoked it didnt get one
[10/27/17, 4:58:40 PM] Justin: had to look to see if he wrote that lol
[10/27/17, 4:59:03 PM] Miller: writing for rambo not super impressive
[10/27/17, 4:59:09 PM] Miller: theres like 19 lines of dialogue
[10/27/17, 4:59:18 PM] Miller: burma? burmas a warzone
[10/27/17, 5:00:17 PM] Justin: bunch of thorats being slit.... random boat attacks.....random hut attacks...movie over
[10/27/17, 5:01:57 PM] Justin: forgot to end it i with rambo goes home
[10/27/17, 5:02:18 PM] Miller: SPOILER
[10/27/17, 5:02:38 PM] Donk: Oh, id also put the new bladerunner on this list of great sequels
[10/27/17, 5:03:31 PM] Justin: hidden gem is the raid 2
[10/27/17, 5:03:52 PM] Justin: took an awesome first movie and expanded the universe it was in while still being fucken awesome
[10/27/17, 5:05:07 PM] Launchpad: I'm shocked no one has mentioned the greatest sequel of all time
[10/27/17, 5:05:17 PM] Launchpad: Beverly Hills Cop 3
[10/27/17, 5:06:08 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[10/27/17, 5:07:21 PM] Justin: we forgot about Dark knight
[10/27/17, 5:08:05 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/27/17, 5:09:51 PM] Justin: I mean it is shitty in that in the end it mostly helps amazon
[10/27/17, 5:13:24 PM] Miller: I might sign up for that after the week I had
[10/27/17, 5:13:42 PM] Miller: Raid 2 is the WOAT
[10/27/17, 5:14:03 PM] Justin: pfff, that jail fight scene one of best action scenes all time
[10/27/17, 5:14:29 PM] Justin: dude just fighting off hundreds of people
[10/27/17, 5:14:37 PM] Miller: I've never been more confused in my life trying to follow a plot
[10/27/17, 5:15:00 PM] Justin: lol see fast 6 7 and 8
[10/27/17, 5:15:16 PM] Miller: So they literally took actors from the first movie and then put them into the second movie but had them play different characters with no explanation
[10/27/17, 5:15:18 PM] Miller: It's insanity
[10/27/17, 5:15:26 PM] Launchpad: Told you to buy TEAM
[10/27/17, 5:15:37 PM] Justin: thats like the first two minutes, also think he may be same guy
[10/27/17, 5:15:43 PM] Miller: No he's not
[10/27/17, 5:15:44 PM] Justin: but its been a while
[10/27/17, 5:15:44 PM] Brian Katz: No way, in fact way more impressive than most movies. Each one was dealing with current issues in politics. One was about America‚Äôs treatment of the Vietnam vets when they Came Home. 2 was about the forgotten pow‚Äôs. And 3 was about the Russian war in Afghanistan.
[10/27/17, 5:15:56 PM] Miller: People think that because obviously that's natural to assume
[10/27/17, 5:16:08 PM] Miller: But just proves you also didn't know wtf was happening
[10/27/17, 5:16:25 PM] Brian Katz: Raid 2 was dope
[10/27/17, 5:16:37 PM] Justin: "The film opens with Bejo, a self-made Jakarta crime boss, executing Rama's brother Andi at a sugar cane field for being too ambitious and not knowing "limitation" after taking over from Tama, a local gang boss who operated under Bangun."
[10/27/17, 5:16:51 PM] Justin: would appear i was right
[10/27/17, 5:16:56 PM] Donk: Hes not the same guy??
[10/27/17, 5:17:01 PM] Justin: he is
[10/27/17, 5:17:14 PM] Donk: Ok, good haha. I thought he was
[10/27/17, 5:17:18 PM] Brian Katz: Who cares great action
[10/27/17, 5:17:54 PM] Miller: Dude Cmon there's no more than 17 lines of dialogue in the latest Rambo movie
[10/27/17, 5:18:08 PM] Miller: He's not
[10/27/17, 5:18:44 PM] Justin: "Andi uses his influence to allow Rama to leave with the injured Bowo and a detained Lt. Wahyu. Gofar, who protected Bowo, watches from a window grinning with relief. Andi also hands over emergency blackmail recordings Tama made of corrupt officials he dealt with, telling him to contact Officer Bunawar. Rama asks Andi to come home, but Andi refuses due to his acclimation to his criminal lifestyle. Andi asserts he can protect Rama in his role as a gang boss, but that Rama can't do the same for him. As he turns around and walks back to the apartment block, the trio exit to an uncertain future.
[10/27/17, 5:18:45 PM] Miller: I'm not talking about the main character
[10/27/17, 5:18:46 PM] Justin: end of first movie
[10/27/17, 5:18:56 PM] Justin: beginning of 2nd see above.....same guy
[10/27/17, 5:21:48 PM] Justin: tehy may have reused a bad guy as someone else... i kinda remember that
[10/27/17, 5:22:33 PM] Brian Katz: That was about the civil war in Burma
[10/27/17, 5:22:39 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm telling you rewatch
[10/27/17, 5:22:55 PM] Justin: this guy http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3345670/?ref_=tt_cl_t4
[10/27/17, 5:23:33 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[10/27/17, 5:23:36 PM] Miller: Which says nothing about the writing in the movie, that's just a setting
[10/27/17, 5:24:06 PM] Miller: That guy was a main character
[10/27/17, 5:24:21 PM] Miller: How the fuck do you bring him back and just give him a different role
[10/27/17, 5:24:37 PM] Miller: I literally didn't even realize he wasn't playing the same guy until the end
[10/27/17, 5:25:16 PM] Justin: by civil war do you mean the war where Buddhist monks have and are crruetnly murdering millions of muslims and @17189742074 isn't saying anything
[10/27/17, 5:37:34 PM] Brian Katz: Okay in that movie the church leader condemned everyone for their violent ways, and in the end he ended up killing men to save his own life. He lost his morality through the course of the movie. While John Rambo wanted nothing to do with violence, but when he sees that these people are in trouble he checks his own moral code to go in there and save the American hostages, by killing all of these Burmese soldiers
[10/27/17, 5:39:22 PM] Miller: Furthermore the larger scale fights didn't resonate as well as the smaller ones, too many quick cuts, too many people, impossible to actually see wtf was going on
[10/27/17, 5:39:24 PM] Miller: Raid > Dredd > Raid 2
[10/27/17, 5:48:40 PM] Justin: what about john wick 1,2
[10/27/17, 5:49:04 PM] Brian Katz: Major league 2
[10/27/17, 5:49:06 PM] Justin: i liked 2, expanded the scope similar to raid 2, but john wick was just too fucken awesome
[10/27/17, 5:49:09 PM] Brian Katz: Best sequel ever
[10/27/17, 5:49:34 PM] Miller: John wick 2 was alright, not nearly as good as 1

[10/27/17, 10:23:03 PM] Justin: Man ellway missed golden opportunity to go as steve bannon

[10/28/17, 9:37:08 AM] Kiyoon: Herman you think my elway friend looks like Steve Bannon????
[10/28/17, 9:37:21 AM] Kiyoon: I forgot you've met him before
[10/28/17, 3:34:35 PM] Launchpad: Maybe cause the only people who would actually get that reference are the people he wants to avoid?
[10/28/17, 3:36:13 PM] Justin: Yeh I hear Jon elway gets all the girls wet.
[10/28/17, 3:38:41 PM] Miller: That might be the meanest thing you've ever said
[10/28/17, 3:39:02 PM] Miller: Steve Bannon maybe the ugliest person in the world

[10/30/17, 5:49:54 PM] Launchpad: it really added nothing to the article

[10/31/17, 12:49:39 PM] Launchpad: missed that one herm, there will be a lot more
[10/31/17, 12:49:45 PM] Brian Katz: Did you take a women home that night? Or hook up with someone while wearing that?

[10/31/17, 12:51:10 PM] Justin: sounds like a sucess
[10/31/17, 12:51:51 PM] Brian Katz: So what happened after you two got kicked out?
[10/31/17, 12:52:22 PM] Launchpad: and I made out with like 4 girls this weekend
[10/31/17, 12:52:31 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs not what I asked
[10/31/17, 12:52:32 PM] Launchpad: so above average success rate while looking stupid
[10/31/17, 12:53:02 PM] Launchpad: We got split up, and I decided to just bounce rather than hang out and wait around
[10/31/17, 12:53:42 PM] Launchpad: I don't dress like this for the men Katz
[10/31/17, 12:54:00 PM] Brian Katz: But she took your cock out and put it in her mouth. Seems strange that you‚Äôd get split up after that
[10/31/17, 12:54:13 PM] Brian Katz: You dress like that for the women?
[10/31/17, 12:54:42 PM] Launchpad: for harambe #dicksout

[10/31/17, 5:11:58 PM] Tk: Yea. Flacco is still on life support. It will be another  .500 season w a random 15-20th pick.
[10/31/17, 5:26:05 PM] Miller: [Live thread of the situation](https://www.reddit.com/live/zv7ufhj5cq9e/)

### Event Summary courtesy of the /r/VolunteerLiveTeam

* Police continue to investigate a vehicle ramming incident that occurred in the general area of Chambers St and West St in Lower Manhattan, New York City.
* **At least seven people have died, and as many as 9 people were injured in the incident.**
* Updated media reports indicate that the incident is being investigated by the FBI as a possible terror attack; however, there are no reported links to potential terror organizations at this time. Sources do indicate that the incident was a deliberate act.
* Schools in the Lower Manhattan area were placed on a precautionary lockdown, and area roads been closed while the investigation continues. Road closures include: W 14th St and W 23rd St (from East River to Hudson River), southbound and northbound FDR Dr (at 34th St), and West St (from 34th St to Chambers St).
* Sources reported that a vehicle initially ran over multiple people in a bike lane along West St.
The vehicle then crashed into a school bus in the area, at which point the driver emerged from the vehicle with imitation firearms.
* The suspect was later shot at the scene by police and was taken into custody. Police now state that there is no active threat to the area, and there are no outstanding suspects at this time. Use caution in the area and expect heavy police activity.

[10/31/17, 5:27:39 PM] Justin: ill just google it in 5 hours
[10/31/17, 5:29:15 PM] Miller: ABC News: Suspect is approximately 30 years old, of Middle Eastern descent, carrying a Florida ID
[10/31/17, 5:29:38 PM] Brian Katz: The New York shooter?
[10/31/17, 5:30:10 PM] Brian Katz: New Launchpad btw
[10/31/17, 5:31:53 PM] Kiyoon: Yeah my friend in the NYPD is saying he's hearing that rumor too
[10/31/17, 5:38:32 PM] Miller: There was no shooting
[10/31/17, 5:38:33 PM] Miller: Well the police shot at him
[10/31/17, 5:40:32 PM] Miller: Nope
[10/31/17, 5:45:27 PM] Justin: plus side of the guy being brown is  at least their wont be conspiracy theories about how this didnt happen and people that died were paid actors
[10/31/17, 5:53:00 PM] Launchpad: that will still happen -- need a reason to go to war with iran
[10/31/17, 5:58:30 PM] Justin: if this guy is brown, reddit and 4chan will be void of conspiracy talk about false flags and the Clinton foundation
[10/31/17, 5:59:52 PM] Brian Katz: You think this actually happened guys? Sounds fishy to me. #conspiracyDontHave Color
[10/31/17, 6:00:42 PM] Justin: people are lying dead on the street? Theres tons of video?...I dont see a flash in any of that video, its clearly to cover up some pedo ring being ran out of a pizzeria
[10/31/17, 6:02:03 PM] Brian Katz: You think this has anything to do with Kevin Spacey?
[10/31/17, 6:02:43 PM] Justin: it is possible its god punishing us for the gays
[10/31/17, 6:04:28 PM] Brian Katz: I mean it happened yesterday and what better a situation to make us forget about Kevin Spacey being a chi-mo?
[10/31/17, 6:04:49 PM] Launchpad: he has cancer too???
[10/31/17, 6:05:02 PM] Justin: house of cards producers actually has a cousin whose brother donates to clinton foundation
[10/31/17, 6:05:10 PM] Brian Katz: You think the Illuminati are involved?
[10/31/17, 6:05:44 PM] Brian Katz: They may have planned it at cherry grove
[10/31/17, 6:05:48 PM] Justin: kevin spacey also does like em young, so maybe 4chan investigative jouranlists were getting too close

[10/31/17, 9:13:38 PM] Justin: haha
[10/31/17, 9:43:47 PM] Miller: Bring morrow in
[10/31/17, 9:43:50 PM] Miller: Great idea
[10/31/17, 9:43:59 PM] Miller: It's been at least 5 minutes since he last pitched
[11/1/17, 7:56:03 AM] Scott: Shit
[11/1/17, 7:57:39 AM] James  L: Period, cat spray, feet and Marlboro lights
[11/1/17, 7:58:01 AM] Scott: That's a very distinctive cocktail there @16465236894
[11/1/17, 8:51:36 AM] Kiyoon: Someone on my block was dressed like that
[11/1/17, 9:16:55 AM] Brian Katz: People are stupid
[11/1/17, 11:20:49 AM] Launchpad: another day another new high for the price of bitcoin
[11/1/17, 11:22:25 AM] Scott: how much you got in on that?
[11/1/17, 11:22:58 AM] Launchpad: enough to keep my eye on the price
[11/1/17, 11:25:38 AM] Launchpad: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to even have a college degree, at all. If someone graduated from a great university that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things but it‚Äôs not necessarily the case.‚Äù ‚Äì Elon Musk
[11/1/17, 11:26:17 AM] Scott: o shit, elon musk with that #hottaek
[11/1/17, 12:08:39 PM] Justin: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bXM3a1dSIhM
[11/1/17, 12:08:52 PM] Justin: Sorry Elon musk
[11/1/17, 12:09:19 PM] Miller: More like Herman ruins everything amirite?
[11/1/17, 12:17:13 PM] Launchpad: no one said you get to become Bill Gates by dropping out
[11/1/17, 12:17:17 PM] Justin: Perfect for next years haloween
[11/1/17, 12:17:26 PM] Launchpad: way to exaggerate with that straw man argument
[11/1/17, 12:17:53 PM] Justin: Did you watch the video? Rhetorical question
[11/1/17, 12:18:06 PM] Launchpad: no Im working I just got out of a meeting
[11/1/17, 12:18:53 PM] Miller: Bitcoin 6k and you still have to work? Sad!
[11/1/17, 12:19:16 PM] Launchpad: lol you're right it is
[11/1/17, 12:20:03 PM] Launchpad: should be a millionaire by now tbh
[11/1/17, 12:20:17 PM] Launchpad: watched the video and it missed the point
[11/1/17, 12:24:23 PM] Justin: watched the video and *i* ~t~ missed the point
[11/1/17, 12:24:32 PM] Justin: fixed it
[11/1/17, 12:24:35 PM] Miller: Lololol
[11/1/17, 12:24:36 PM] Launchpad: "College dropouts are 71% more likely to be unemployed"  

Lets be clear...These are dropouts who dropped out cause they couldn't pass their classes.  This isn't a number based on those who were self motivated that they decided to forego college for their own self education.
[11/1/17, 12:25:18 PM] Justin: ok so what exactly are people that dont go to college?
[11/1/17, 12:25:21 PM] Launchpad: no one suggested dropping out of college is a magic formula for success and if you believe that then you're quite dumb
[11/1/17, 12:25:51 PM] Miller: Herman ruins everything
[11/1/17, 12:26:38 PM] Launchpad: if you have a strong work ethic and a never ending quest for knowledge, and are a self learner, then you don't need college
[11/1/17, 12:27:49 PM] Justin: sure, done playing this game
[11/1/17, 12:28:12 PM] Launchpad: if you want to be a programmer, you can learn programming on your own
[11/1/17, 12:28:36 PM] Launchpad: although, its one of the rare fields where a college degree is still valuable and worth it
[11/1/17, 12:29:51 PM] Miller: What about if you have an okay worth ethic, not a self learner, medium quest for knowledge but you inherited 8 billion dollars, do you need college?
[11/1/17, 12:29:56 PM] Launchpad: how about this...if you lack ambition and self motivation, go to college so you can have someone telling you what to do all the time
[11/1/17, 12:30:16 PM] Donk: i think that most fields having a college degree is still valuable and worth it
[11/1/17, 12:30:19 PM] Justin: I get it,  Musk is in fact presumably talking baout tech industry, but thats your industry so obviously a college degree is valuable *there*
[11/1/17, 12:30:34 PM] Launchpad: No if you have 8 billion dollars, yes if you don't
[11/1/17, 12:30:42 PM] Miller: Babysitting industry honestly has no respect for college degrees
[11/1/17, 12:31:07 PM] Donk: yeah, i dont know why i involved myself in this
[11/1/17, 12:31:12 PM] Donk: im just going to back away
[11/1/17, 12:31:20 PM] Justin: lol
[11/1/17, 12:32:11 PM] Justin: funny thing is adam addresses the outrageous costs of college in the episode, including the burden of student debt and weighing the benefits of an education against career oppurtunity
[11/1/17, 12:32:46 PM] Justin: or you could just be mindful and a hard worker that doesn't want to go to college, those ideals arent contradictory at all
[11/1/17, 12:33:31 PM] Launchpad: Fact: A certain type of person can thrive without going to college
Fact: Most people aren't that person

Adam just assumes that everyone fits into the second group and is addressing them
[11/1/17, 12:33:47 PM] Justin: fact anyone can say anything they want
[11/1/17, 12:33:50 PM] Justin: see how that works
[11/1/17, 12:33:54 PM] Launchpad: smart hard worker
[11/1/17, 12:34:00 PM] Launchpad: you have to work intelligently
[11/1/17, 12:34:03 PM] Justin: i cant disprove a negative
[11/1/17, 12:34:23 PM] Justin: prove a negative*
[11/1/17, 12:36:21 PM] Justin: so why quote elon musk saying that in the first place....do you believe that many people in this group are in fact that 1st group?
[11/1/17, 12:36:24 PM] Miller: College costs aren't even that bad if you just invest your college savings fund into bitcoin 18 years in advance
[11/1/17, 12:36:35 PM] Launchpad: Lets flip this around then. 

You can go to college, get a degree, then never apply it towards a job, basically rendering it useless
[11/1/17, 12:37:12 PM] Justin: go home watch the full episode, come back to me...its an enjoyable episode
[11/1/17, 12:38:25 PM] Justin: most jobs require college degrees at this point.....but yes once again what you said is a fact, albeit a useless one
[11/1/17, 12:38:27 PM] Launchpad: 1 btc might be worth a million by then
[11/1/17, 12:41:42 PM] Miller: Fact bears beets Battlestar Galactica
[11/1/17, 12:42:37 PM] Scott: @16316620763
[11/1/17, 12:45:30 PM] Justin: there is tons of irony in my case and what i'm arguing.  Perhaps it's an ability to discern an outlier from statistical significance
[11/1/17, 12:48:46 PM] Launchpad: how about this: If you are an entrepreneur, you don't need a college degree
[11/1/17, 12:49:42 PM] Launchpad: obviously there are jobs that require it - and if you know what you want to do then do it
[11/1/17, 12:49:46 PM] Miller: What about if you are a wantrapreneur
[11/1/17, 12:50:23 PM] Launchpad: learn to hustle
[11/1/17, 12:52:10 PM] Brian Katz: Herman doesn‚Äôt lack hustle. You ever see him play sports? It‚Äôs enthusiasm, heart and talent he lacks.
[11/1/17, 12:52:21 PM] Launchpad: lol
[11/1/17, 12:58:00 PM] Justin: so i suppose new katz is in college because its fun, not because its a necessity?
[11/1/17, 12:59:42 PM] Miller: I'm ashamed it took me this long but launchpad is basically just endorsing his favorite musicians thoughts
[11/1/17, 1:00:10 PM] Miller: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_College_Dropout
[11/1/17, 1:00:57 PM] Brian Katz: New katz Needs to be able to run a business from top to bottom. New Katz needs knowledge of these things now.
[11/1/17, 1:01:29 PM] Justin: but all you nee dis hardwork and intelligence
[11/1/17, 1:01:33 PM] Justin: college doesnt get you those things katz
[11/1/17, 1:01:45 PM] Justin: you cna learn how to run a company on your own
[11/1/17, 1:01:46 PM] Justin: its easy
[11/1/17, 1:02:07 PM] Brian Katz: While that is true, I find it to be the easiest way to gain this knowledge.
[11/1/17, 1:03:20 PM] Justin: so it's "true" but likely your life-coach, whom you trust's opinion, doesn't feel the same way....and pretty much you don't either at this point
[11/1/17, 1:03:51 PM] Justin: college=necessity
[11/1/17, 1:04:21 PM] Miller: Would reccomend not taking fashion advice from said life coach
[11/1/17, 1:04:40 PM] Justin: lol
[11/1/17, 1:07:43 PM] Brian Katz: I can learn by doing. But I‚Äôm taking over a ln existing business and I want to be as prepared as possible. I could just do all these jobs and learn that way as well.
[11/1/17, 1:08:58 PM] Justin: no argument here
[11/1/17, 1:09:19 PM] Justin: you are saying college will better prepare you for your life ahead
[11/1/17, 1:09:38 PM] Miller: LeBron James never went to college
[11/1/17, 1:09:49 PM] Justin: which is pretty much the use case for almost everyone who goes to college, even the ones that fuck around
[11/1/17, 1:10:27 PM] Justin: Gates dropped out
[11/1/17, 1:10:39 PM] Justin: of harvard no less, who needs the iveys
[11/1/17, 1:11:00 PM] Miller: Zuckerberg
[11/1/17, 1:11:02 PM] Miller: Kanye
[11/1/17, 1:11:05 PM] Miller: Mark from Cuba
[11/1/17, 1:11:22 PM] Miller: Seems pretty obvious dropping out of college is the best path to success
[11/1/17, 1:12:15 PM] Miller: Jayz never went to college
[11/1/17, 1:13:25 PM] Miller: http://thesource.com/2017/10/30/swizz-beatz-graduates-three-weeks/
[11/1/17, 1:18:53 PM] Dan Watts: I've seen a lot about this
[11/1/17, 1:19:08 PM] Dan Watts: Def like some non degree certificate program
[11/1/17, 1:19:24 PM] Miller: For sure
[11/1/17, 1:19:43 PM] Dan Watts: Also unrelated chipotle has queso now and it's pretty awesome
[11/1/17, 1:20:06 PM] Dan Watts: Damn
[11/1/17, 1:20:31 PM] Dan Watts: From today?
[11/1/17, 1:21:51 PM] Scott: boom!
[11/1/17, 1:22:36 PM] Miller: Also unrelated I can't stand sparkling water
[11/1/17, 1:22:48 PM] Miller: It's awful and doesn't quench my thirst
[11/1/17, 1:22:59 PM] Miller: (I also dislike seltzer)
[11/1/17, 1:24:00 PM] Dan Watts: Damn
[11/1/17, 1:24:39 PM] Miller: Chipotle queso is alright, texture is a bit off, the Qdoba queso is way better
[11/1/17, 1:25:08 PM] Dan Watts: Nothing touches the Austin queso
[11/1/17, 1:25:19 PM] Dan Watts: #tb #memories #goodtimes
[11/1/17, 1:25:22 PM] Donk: I also dont like seltzer or flavored waters
[11/1/17, 1:25:26 PM] Scott: seltzer blows
[11/1/17, 1:25:41 PM] Miller: People in my office are obsessed with seltzer
[11/1/17, 1:25:47 PM] Dan Watts: I fucks with seltzer
[11/1/17, 1:25:49 PM] Miller: They drink like 5 cans a day each
[11/1/17, 1:25:52 PM] Kiyoon: chipotle queso blows
[11/1/17, 1:26:09 PM] Dan Watts: Kiyoon your lactose intolerant what do you know
[11/1/17, 1:26:21 PM] Miller: No lactose?
[11/1/17, 1:26:29 PM] Miller: No wonder you have brittle bones
[11/1/17, 1:26:56 PM] Miller: Also the irony of cheese being your bff
[11/1/17, 1:27:19 PM] Scott: üëØ
[11/1/17, 1:27:30 PM] Kiyoon: I'm not lactose intoleraant
[11/1/17, 1:27:35 PM] Kiyoon: I'm just intolerant of Cheese
[11/1/17, 1:27:46 PM] Scott: üëØ
[11/1/17, 1:28:12 PM] Miller: Lol watts trying to sneak in some fake news
[11/1/17, 1:33:25 PM] Scott: or maybe kiyoon is the one with teh fake news
[11/1/17, 1:33:28 PM] Scott: conspiracy.
[11/1/17, 1:57:23 PM] Launchpad: yes cause clearly that was exactly what I said (I actually specifically said that is not the case)
[11/1/17, 1:58:20 PM] Launchpad: As for Katz, he has a mission and a purpose, and college is part of that roadmap.  That is perfectly valid.
[11/1/17, 2:00:13 PM] Launchpad: The people who don't need college are 1) a specific entrepreneurial personality 2) someone with no direction or aim in life and sits around complaining on the internet all day.  Save yourself the debt so that's one less thing to complain about
[11/1/17, 2:00:45 PM] Launchpad: and do take fashion advice from me if you want to get your dick sucked in the bar üòÇ
[11/1/17, 2:00:48 PM] Justin: so you would advocate that 2 decreases his chances of finding a job....seems like solid advise
[11/1/17, 2:01:45 PM] Justin: where do you get these hyperbolic images of people?
[11/1/17, 2:01:57 PM] Launchpad: if hes never looking for a job then no need for the degree
[11/1/17, 2:02:00 PM] Justin: for someone who doesnt like black and white, you sure view others that way
[11/1/17, 2:02:38 PM] Launchpad: ummm no -- you are the one assuming everyone should go to college, not me
[11/1/17, 2:02:51 PM] Launchpad: I am saying its not always necessary in all cases
[11/1/17, 2:02:57 PM] Launchpad: simple as that, you're reading too much into it
[11/1/17, 2:03:05 PM] Justin: you are literally giving me categories of who shoudnt go
[11/1/17, 2:03:14 PM] Justin: and than complaining im giving categories of who should?
[11/1/17, 2:04:10 PM] Justin: noone can exist in life without getting a job, unless they inherit family wealth....we live in a capitalist society where even tog et dfood stamps you need to work
[11/1/17, 2:04:11 PM] Launchpad: what 'category' should go?
[11/1/17, 2:04:38 PM] Justin: for 99.5% of people.....every single one of them
[11/1/17, 2:05:02 PM] Justin: so pretending like there is meaning to sayings like "you dont need college", is idiotic
[11/1/17, 2:05:20 PM] Launchpad: 'not everyone needs college'
[11/1/17, 2:05:27 PM] Justin: if you watched the video, youu would learn that only 1% of jobs added since the 90's dont require a college degree
[11/1/17, 2:05:39 PM] Justin: that means 99% of jobs added post manufactoring economy.....require college degree
[11/1/17, 2:05:41 PM] Sean: Pretty soon you‚Äôre not gonna find a job with out a maters
[11/1/17, 2:05:54 PM] Sean: Masters*
[11/1/17, 2:06:08 PM] Justin: damn @sean sighting
[11/1/17, 2:06:22 PM] Sean: ‚ù§
[11/1/17, 2:07:12 PM] Justin: usually you come in with a herman zinger, ill take the love
[11/1/17, 2:08:14 PM] Justin: like i say something about isis and your phone  notification flashes  "herman said something stupid, go in there and tell him thats stupid"
[11/1/17, 2:09:10 PM] Launchpad: yes and pretty soon you wont be able to find a job with a masters cause the robots will have taken them all
[11/1/17, 2:11:01 PM] Sean: Lmao
[11/1/17, 2:11:08 PM] Sean: Always team herman
[11/1/17, 2:11:26 PM] Sean: Not in our lifetime
[11/1/17, 2:12:01 PM] Launchpad: Bro were gonna hit the singularity in our lifetime
[11/1/17, 2:12:03 PM] Donk: yeah, robots taking away a shit ton of jobs is like in the next 10 years
[11/1/17, 2:12:08 PM] Justin: could be in our lifetime sadly
[11/1/17, 2:12:12 PM] Donk: once self-driving cars on the roads
[11/1/17, 2:12:20 PM] Donk: thats the end of a shit ton of driving related jobs right there
[11/1/17, 2:12:26 PM] Donk: and thats just the tip of the iceberg
[11/1/17, 2:12:29 PM] Dan Watts: That real life singularity
[11/1/17, 2:12:34 PM] Justin: yeh thats like 3 million jobs i think?
[11/1/17, 2:12:46 PM] Justin: might be more cant remember....truckdrivers, cabs etc
[11/1/17, 2:13:11 PM] Dan Watts: Supposedly driving is some absurd percentage of male work force
[11/1/17, 2:13:30 PM] Justin: "hat makes sense, given today's employment: In 2014, there were 4 million driver jobs in the U.S., 3.1 million of which were truck drivers, Goldman said. That represents 2 percent of total employment."
[11/1/17, 2:13:29 PM] Donk: we are going to have to move toward some sort of universal basic income at some point in the near future
[11/1/17, 2:13:54 PM] Donk: but instead, we are moving backwards
[11/1/17, 2:14:16 PM] Justin: yeh its rough
[11/1/17, 2:14:35 PM] Donk: universal health care would be a good step in that direction, and help people get used ot hte idea
[11/1/17, 2:14:40 PM] Justin: jon oliver was great this weekend with the whole " IT FUCKEN IS< TRUST ME IT IS"

[11/1/17, 9:39:14 PM] Scott: My #dynastyleaguekeeper
[11/1/17, 9:39:24 PM] Miller: Na
[11/1/17, 10:33:23 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/1/17, 10:34:13 PM] Justin: i mean that was presumably your industry for decades right?
[11/1/17, 10:34:47 PM] Justin: even the plot of trading places
[11/1/17, 10:35:21 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[11/1/17, 10:35:36 PM] Justin: im saying before wall street went wild it was wild for comoddities
[11/1/17, 10:36:32 PM] Justin: entire trading places plot was they were stealing the comddities futures report before it was made public to makie millions
[11/1/17, 10:36:59 PM] Miller: You consider ketchup a commodity?
[11/1/17, 10:37:05 PM] Justin: so short answer yeh demand and supply swing
[11/1/17, 10:37:23 PM] Justin: id presume its largely correlated to tomatoes
[11/1/17, 10:37:29 PM] Justin: maybe thats a bad assumption
[11/1/17, 10:37:52 PM] Miller: I have no idea I would like to understand what would case the demand for ketchup to change
[11/1/17, 10:38:57 PM] Justin: would think demand would be reflective of aggregate demand in us economy
[11/1/17, 10:39:32 PM] Miller: I would assume ketchup is recession proof and operates independently of macroeconomic conditions
[11/1/17, 10:39:56 PM] Justin: thats fair
[11/1/17, 10:40:00 PM] Justin: i wonder what the answer actually is
[11/1/17, 10:44:09 PM] Dan Watts: Fuck it im making my own ketchup now
[11/1/17, 10:44:20 PM] Launchpad: the rise of hipster gourmet sauces, aiolis, salsas, mustards
[11/1/17, 10:44:42 PM] Launchpad: absolutely has an impact on the sale of ketchup
[11/1/17, 10:45:16 PM] Dan Watts: That gourmet aoli tho
[11/1/17, 10:45:59 PM] Miller: To me none of those are ketchup substitutes
[11/1/17, 10:46:03 PM] Justin: i blame the NFL
[11/1/17, 10:46:22 PM] Miller: If someone served me a burger with gourmet aoli I would throw it back at them
[11/1/17, 10:46:48 PM] Miller: Lol did you see that papa John's shit?
[11/1/17, 10:47:15 PM] Justin: nfl lowered sale of papa johns pizza and if your gross enough to buy papa johns, you definitely put ketchup on your pizza
[11/1/17, 10:47:29 PM] Justin: just new hermaned myself kinda
[11/1/17, 10:47:40 PM] Miller: I saw that earlier so funny
[11/1/17, 10:47:59 PM] Justin: i like their a political stance in the statement
[11/1/17, 10:48:01 PM] Launchpad: i always use ketchup substitutes - thats what they are there for
[11/1/17, 10:48:28 PM] Justin: they ar elike the nfls handeling of certain issues(by the players' and the fans')
[11/1/17, 10:48:34 PM] Miller: Ignore the fact we make shitty pizza and Domino's and pizza Hut do what we do but way better, ignore the fact our founder and ceo is a huge douche
[11/1/17, 10:48:42 PM] Miller: It's gotta be the anthem protests
[11/1/17, 10:49:01 PM] Justin: yeh pizza hut and dominoes are at least creative
[11/1/17, 10:49:10 PM] Miller: I'm telling you there is no ketchup substitute
[11/1/17, 10:49:13 PM] Dan Watts: Had a burger today with jack Daniels BBQ sauce
[11/1/17, 10:49:18 PM] Dan Watts: Shit  was cash money
[11/1/17, 10:49:28 PM] Launchpad: Id rather put hot sauce on fries than ketchup
[11/1/17, 10:49:37 PM] Miller: I fucks with some bbq sauce on my burger but only sporadically
[11/1/17, 10:49:55 PM] Miller: I don't think by any means I use less ketchup today than I did 5 years ago
[11/1/17, 10:50:36 PM] Miller: 99 percent chance watts was at TGI Friday's
[11/1/17, 10:50:50 PM] Justin: you definitely use more with evan and ryan
[11/1/17, 10:50:58 PM] Launchpad: lol
[11/1/17, 10:51:06 PM] Miller: Right but that's part of the cycle presumably
[11/1/17, 10:51:15 PM] Miller: Kids eat a disproportionate amount
[11/1/17, 10:51:23 PM] Miller: Then grow out of it
[11/1/17, 10:51:29 PM] Miller: Then plateau
[11/1/17, 10:51:32 PM] Miller: Then have kids
[11/1/17, 10:51:41 PM] Launchpad: #fadeketchup
[11/1/17, 10:52:54 PM] Miller: Can't wait until this economy crashes because hipsters are replacing ketchup with organic Chipotle aoli
[11/1/17, 10:53:01 PM] Miller: I'm sure I'll get blamed for it
[11/1/17, 10:53:55 PM] Miller: Hey I know I make 13k a year but instead of this ketchup which is 4 dollars a gallon let's use this which is 12 dollars an ounce
[11/1/17, 10:54:11 PM] Launchpad: all this talk about food...check out these ribs Im destroying rn
[11/1/17, 10:54:31 PM] Miller: I had dinosaur bbq ribs tonight come at me
[11/1/17, 10:54:41 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/1/17, 10:54:58 PM] Justin: some fresh bbq
[11/1/17, 10:55:08 PM] Miller: You replace your phone with an actual potato?
[11/1/17, 10:55:59 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/1/17, 10:56:13 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[11/1/17, 10:56:48 PM] Justin: yeh my cracked iphone screen got better clarity than that
[11/1/17, 10:57:19 PM] Justin: id take a picture of it, but that has become impossible due to technology
[11/1/17, 10:57:54 PM] Miller: Lol I saw some idiot the other day try to send a screenshot to show their cracked screen
[11/1/17, 10:58:46 PM] Justin: admittedly i do soemtimes think " man how anyone gonna be able to see this screenshot with all this cracking"
[11/1/17, 10:59:03 PM] Justin: so i cant laugh at him
[11/1/17, 10:59:25 PM] Miller: I'll just laugh at both of you
[11/1/17, 10:59:53 PM] Justin: fair
[11/1/17, 11:04:26 PM] Miller: Garbage human, garbage pizza, papa John's is pretty good
[11/1/17, 11:07:35 PM] Launchpad: sorry was busy eating some really fucken good blurry ribs
[11/1/17, 11:08:10 PM] Launchpad: as far as chain pizza goes I kind of like papa johns and their garlic sauce
[11/1/17, 11:40:23 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/2/17, 12:11:03 AM] Justin: guess ynaks had a better shot than i thought
[11/2/17, 12:11:21 AM] Justin: for sure thought dodgers were winning that series
[11/2/17, 12:43:21 AM] Brian Katz: Me too, thought the dodgers were way better
[11/2/17, 7:38:19 AM] Miller: Astros are legit, springer Altuve Correa Bergman is a really nice core, Verlander and keuchel and mccullers and Morton are better than you would think
[11/2/17, 7:38:20 AM] Miller: This was like the opposite of the Indians Yankees series because neither of these teams had any bullpen
[11/2/17, 7:46:44 AM] Scott: Even peacock is filthy
[11/2/17, 7:46:51 AM] Scott: He's no 5th starter
[11/2/17, 7:47:03 AM] Scott: He would be top 3 starter on alot of teams
[11/2/17, 7:47:05 AM] Scott: Poss 2
[11/2/17, 7:47:36 AM] Miller: idk about 2
[11/2/17, 7:47:42 AM] Miller: but hes solid
[11/2/17, 7:48:20 AM] Miller: Marwin Gonzalez turned this whole series around
[11/2/17, 7:48:51 AM] Scott: That guy plays every position but catcher and pitcher.
[11/2/17, 7:49:09 AM] Scott: They even have an ok bullpen but they are cold
[11/2/17, 7:49:14 AM] Scott: Giles is decent
[11/2/17, 7:49:22 AM] Scott: Deverovski is great
[11/2/17, 7:50:17 AM] Miller: giles was a human gas can this entire playoffs
[11/2/17, 7:50:20 AM] Miller: not a guy you can trust
[11/2/17, 7:50:44 AM] Scott: Came out of nowhere. He has a good season
[11/2/17, 7:50:55 AM] Scott: But yes bullpen was cold.
[11/2/17, 7:51:21 AM] Scott: Deverovski I think wil end up closing with Harris next year and move giles to set up
[11/2/17, 7:51:21 AM] Miller: came out of nowhere?
[11/2/17, 7:51:33 AM] Miller: the astros traded the #1 overall pick mark appell for him from philly
[11/2/17, 7:51:38 AM] Scott: Huh
[11/2/17, 7:51:41 AM] Scott: I know
[11/2/17, 7:51:52 AM] Scott: In saying he is good
[11/2/17, 7:51:58 AM] Miller: how did he come out of nowhere?
[11/2/17, 7:52:03 AM] Miller: if anything hes worse than expected
[11/2/17, 7:52:21 AM] Miller: oh you mean devernosnki
[11/2/17, 7:52:22 AM] Miller: not giles
[11/2/17, 7:53:15 AM] Scott: Yes
[11/2/17, 7:53:19 AM] Scott: We def confused that up lol
[11/2/17, 7:53:27 AM] Scott: And that was a dumb trade anyway.
[11/2/17, 7:53:35 AM] Miller: i thought you were responding to my giles comment
[11/2/17, 7:53:36 AM] Scott: But we will see how appell does in hindsight
[11/2/17, 7:53:44 AM] Miller: not continuing your own thought
[11/2/17, 7:53:54 AM] Miller: yea at the time it was a terrible trade but appell has been hurt i think
[11/2/17, 7:54:29 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/2/17, 7:54:32 AM] Miller: and a 5 ERA in AAA this yr
[11/2/17, 7:55:18 AM] Miller: would be the first time the astros ever made a good trade w/PHI
[11/2/17, 7:56:13 AM] Scott: Haha
[11/2/17, 7:56:32 AM] Scott: Didn't make sense at the time
[11/2/17, 7:56:37 AM] Scott: I was all like Jackie Chan meme face
[11/2/17, 8:02:08 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/2/17, 8:02:36 AM] Scott: Who dat be
[11/2/17, 8:36:12 AM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs a meme Cheese
[11/2/17, 8:36:31 AM] Scott: Meemeee?
[11/2/17, 8:45:27 AM] Kiyoon: I don't know what bar in NYC, but someone wrote my friends number on one of the big jenga pieces
[11/2/17, 8:45:36 AM] Kiyoon: and he keeps getting random calls from people who pull that piece haah
[11/2/17, 8:45:56 AM] Scott: Lolz #northportcrewshenanigans
[11/2/17, 8:48:13 AM] James  L: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/2/17, 8:49:06 AM] James  L: Ketchup is down because it's really bad for you... half the bottle is sugar but we still love it
[11/2/17, 8:49:19 AM] Dan Watts: Leahy's don't fuck with that gourmet aoli
[11/2/17, 8:49:28 AM] Brian Katz: My name is brian and I also like ketchup
[11/2/17, 8:50:17 AM] Donk: still a ketchup fan, but def use less of it then i used to
[11/2/17, 8:50:37 AM] Donk: too many other crazy sauces to try these days
[11/2/17, 8:51:11 AM] Donk: had a buffalo balsamic maple sauce the other day that was ridiculous
[11/2/17, 8:51:15 AM] James  L: Gourmet aoli is for the birds
[11/2/17, 8:53:28 AM] James  L: Would have to back hand a bitch if anyone at my table asked for gourmet aoli
[11/2/17, 8:54:58 AM] Brian Katz: What would that even go with? Lol
[11/2/17, 8:55:27 AM] Donk: chicken fingers and fries
[11/2/17, 8:55:37 AM] Donk: was really great
[11/2/17, 9:44:45 AM] Launchpad: ketchup being half sugar doesn't help its brand out either.  Its barely even sweet and a waste. Would rather put salsa on my fries
[11/2/17, 9:45:58 AM] Miller: this tax bill is so fucking lame
[11/2/17, 9:46:11 AM] Miller: the one thing i thought trump might actually hook me up with
[11/2/17, 9:46:49 AM] Launchpad: you got a summary or link?
[11/2/17, 9:47:20 AM] Miller: not yet
[11/2/17, 9:49:59 AM] Brian Katz: No way salsa will make your fries soggy
[11/2/17, 9:50:55 AM] Dan Watts: I've had "organic" ketchup which has less sugar and is really gross
[11/2/17, 9:52:10 AM] Launchpad: chipotle ketchup & curry ketchup  >> regular ketchup
[11/2/17, 10:07:30 AM] Miller: https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r0glkG5AC8nM/v0
[11/2/17, 10:09:16 AM] Donk: not sure whether this is going to help or hurt me
[11/2/17, 10:09:18 AM] Donk: likely no difference
[11/2/17, 10:09:30 AM] Miller: yea def bad for me
[11/2/17, 10:09:48 AM] Miller: its weird b/c its not like its helping middle class
[11/2/17, 10:09:56 AM] Miller: its just a transfer payment from wealthy individuals to corporations
[11/2/17, 10:10:09 AM] Miller: which in theory depending on what type of wealthy person you are could help you net/net i guess
[11/2/17, 10:10:13 AM] Sean: Congrats Uncle Herman!
[11/2/17, 10:10:23 AM] Miller: wait what
[11/2/17, 10:10:40 AM] Brian Katz: Sara be pregnant?
[11/2/17, 10:10:51 AM] Miller: or ariel?
[11/2/17, 10:11:09 AM] Brian Katz: No way Ariel
[11/2/17, 10:13:05 AM] Miller: also fucks everyone in NY/NJ/CA
[11/2/17, 10:13:38 AM] Donk: yeah that property tax cap blows
[11/2/17, 10:14:07 AM] Miller: that it does but the not being able to deduct the (very high) state and local is a disaster for high tax states
[11/2/17, 10:14:57 AM] Donk: ah shit, didnt even say that
[11/2/17, 10:15:01 AM] Donk: yeah nevermind, this is bad for me lol
[11/2/17, 10:16:28 AM] Donk: see that that is
[11/2/17, 10:17:58 AM] Sean: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/2/17, 10:18:48 AM] Miller: whaaaaaat
[11/2/17, 10:18:57 AM] Miller: last time i talked to him he told me had no interest in ever having kids
[11/2/17, 10:19:19 AM] Sean: She also said she didn‚Äôt want any
[11/2/17, 10:19:25 AM] Miller: yea
[11/2/17, 10:19:34 AM] Miller: planned?
[11/2/17, 10:19:38 AM] Miller: spill the tea @16316620763
[11/2/17, 10:22:48 AM] Sean: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[11/2/17, 10:39:19 AM] Miller: The House Republican tax plan would claw back a benefit for high-income homeowners: The ability to declare that most profits from home sales aren‚Äôt taxable capital gains.

The proposal retains the current exclusion‚Äî$500,000 for married filers and $250,000 for others. But unlike current law, the benefit would phase out for high-income taxpayers, getting reduced once adjusted gross income hits $500,000 for married couples and $250,000 for others.

The proposal also brings back an older rule for claiming the benefit. To get the exclusion, taxpayers must have used the home as their principal residence for five out of the previous eight years. Current law requires the taxpayer to have lived there for two of the previous five years.
[11/2/17, 10:39:24 AM] Miller: jesus
[11/2/17, 10:39:31 AM] Miller: disaster for home demand
[11/2/17, 10:40:54 AM] Miller: cant deduct student loan interest (for those of you ignoring launchpad and pursuing higher education)
[11/2/17, 10:41:01 AM] Miller: cant wait for stephans impending FB post about that
[11/2/17, 10:43:46 AM] Launchpad: One more strike against college
[11/2/17, 10:44:53 AM] Launchpad: Although currently you can't right off interest anyway if you make something like 75k or more
[11/2/17, 10:45:12 AM] Launchpad: **write
[11/2/17, 10:59:35 AM] Miller: House Tax Bill Is Said to Repeal Electric Vehicle Tax Credit
[11/2/17, 11:00:12 AM] Launchpad: Going to cancel my tesla anyway
[11/2/17, 11:01:32 AM] Miller: lol of course
[11/2/17, 11:07:30 AM] Donk: im still pissed you didnt get the free gift you were promised for signing up on day 1
[11/2/17, 11:07:53 AM] Launchpad: Lol right?
[11/2/17, 11:21:55 AM] Launchpad: https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/28/why-snapchat-spectacles-failed/
[11/2/17, 12:07:33 PM] Scott: i actually distincty remember also talking ot stephan at sean's bday party and him saying that he didnt want to have kids.
[11/2/17, 12:42:18 PM] Dan Watts: Super last minute but anyone want to go to the jets game tonight. We'd still have to get tix
[11/2/17, 12:42:31 PM] Miller: OUT
[11/2/17, 12:42:44 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[11/2/17, 12:43:03 PM] Scott: lol
[11/2/17, 12:43:25 PM] Scott: tickets probalby crazy cheap
[11/2/17, 12:43:32 PM] Scott: i saw last sunday some tix for liek $1-5
[11/2/17, 12:44:18 PM] Brian Katz: Super out
[11/2/17, 12:47:03 PM] Donk: actually could be a pretty decent game
[11/2/17, 12:47:19 PM] Donk: that being said, def out
[11/2/17, 12:49:18 PM] Miller: that was fast, angels signed justin upton to a (pretty cheap) deal, 5/100
[11/2/17, 12:49:28 PM] Miller: weird he would jump at that
[11/2/17, 12:59:46 PM] Justin: Tickets for 1-5$?
[11/2/17, 1:01:07 PM] Scott: Yes
[11/2/17, 1:01:10 PM] Scott: Cheap as duck
[11/2/17, 1:01:48 PM] Donk: it was also pouring
[11/2/17, 1:02:04 PM] Donk: probably not as cheap tonight
[11/2/17, 1:04:48 PM] Miller: yea that game looked miserable w/the rain
[11/2/17, 1:05:26 PM] Donk: i went to a giants game once like that - left at halftime, just couldn't sit there soaked the whole time
[11/2/17, 1:05:43 PM] Miller: wow you left at halftime?
[11/2/17, 1:05:46 PM] Donk: (it was also a meaningless last game of the season when we were already eliminated)
[11/2/17, 1:05:51 PM] Miller: @16195657200 thinks youre not a REAL FAN
[11/2/17, 1:05:57 PM] Miller: REAL FANS dont leave at halftime
[11/2/17, 1:05:58 PM] Miller: !!!!!!
[11/2/17, 1:06:18 PM] Donk: i do generally agree with that
[11/2/17, 1:06:32 PM] Donk: but this was different circumstances
[11/2/17, 1:06:33 PM] Miller: look at you trying to be all comfortable and prioritize your enjoyment of a GAME
[11/2/17, 1:06:45 PM] Launchpad: you can leave whenever the fuck you want, just don't root against your team only 5 weeks into the season
[11/2/17, 1:06:45 PM] Miller: real fans
[11/2/17, 1:06:46 PM] Miller: real fans
[11/2/17, 1:06:49 PM] Miller: how many of us
[11/2/17, 1:06:50 PM] Miller: how many of us
[11/2/17, 1:07:00 PM] Miller: (unless theyre 0-5)
[11/2/17, 1:07:07 PM] Miller: in which case absolutely root against them
[11/2/17, 4:36:00 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/2/17, 4:37:55 PM] Scott: does the car also have a plac ewher eyou can fill up gas?
[11/2/17, 4:38:04 PM] Scott: and how many places really have charging stations now, fi you are driving long distance?
[11/2/17, 4:39:28 PM] Donk: its all electric, not a hybrid
[11/2/17, 4:40:06 PM] Donk: LP probably knows better than me but i believe that there are charging stations all over the place now and you can def go cross country by using them
[11/2/17, 4:40:28 PM] Scott: and what u gotta stop and google every time you need a charging station when you need to charge? pain in the ass.
[11/2/17, 4:40:28 PM] Donk: i know i have seen them at alot of the rest stops on the 95 corridor
[11/2/17, 4:40:43 PM] Donk: my guess is that its built into the GPS system so that it takes you to them
[11/2/17, 4:41:00 PM] Donk: but yeah, def not as easy at the moment as getting gas
[11/2/17, 4:41:01 PM] Launchpad: absolutely
[11/2/17, 4:41:19 PM] Launchpad: not sure how many theyve built out recently
[11/2/17, 4:41:28 PM] Scott: ok thats cool then
[11/2/17, 4:41:36 PM] Donk: i know that for the expensive early models that the charging stations were free
[11/2/17, 4:41:50 PM] Donk: but have heard for the 3 that they are limting/charging for charging?
[11/2/17, 4:42:17 PM] Kiyoon: hang on
[11/2/17, 4:42:20 PM] Launchpad: What is the cost of Supercharging for Model 3?
Model 3 comes standard with the hardware necessary to utilize the global Tesla Supercharger Network. A small fee will apply for Supercharging‚Äîwhich is only a fraction of the cost of gas.
[11/2/17, 4:42:36 PM] Kiyoon: its a pain in the ass to look on your phone gps but its cool that its on the car gps?
[11/2/17, 4:43:25 PM] Donk: if they set up it so that say you are going from nyc to florida, you put it in the gps, and on the route it preplans where you need to stop to charge, i think that would be fine
[11/2/17, 4:43:34 PM] Launchpad: no it just means it will be built into the navigation and be much easier to find
[11/2/17, 4:44:02 PM] Kiyoon: I see
[11/2/17, 4:44:07 PM] Kiyoon: guess it's a little better
[11/2/17, 4:44:46 PM] Donk: yeah, though its got to be getting easier and easier to charge these things
[11/2/17, 4:45:30 PM] Launchpad: they know they'll be putting thousands more cars on the streets so they've got to be updating their charging infrastructure at the same time
[11/2/17, 4:45:59 PM] Donk: and given the popularity, the competition has to be coming out with more electric cars of their own
[11/2/17, 4:46:14 PM] Donk: leading ot more and more charging stations seperate from tesla's network
[11/2/17, 4:46:44 PM] Donk: i see them all the time now
[11/2/17, 4:49:01 PM] Launchpad: still dont know if Ill get one though
[11/2/17, 4:49:11 PM] Launchpad: dont have any sort of home charging plan - id have to figure that out
[11/2/17, 4:50:17 PM] Donk: yeah, thats key
[11/2/17, 4:50:42 PM] Scott: how long from empty to fully charged?
[11/2/17, 4:50:46 PM] Scott: i feel like that's a pain in the ass.
[11/2/17, 4:50:58 PM] Justin: Does it come with a tampon?
[11/2/17, 4:51:37 PM] Launchpad: supercharger station is I think 20 minutes
[11/2/17, 4:52:13 PM] Launchpad: but it doesn't charge linearly so you can get to 80% at a faster rate than the last 20
[11/2/17, 4:52:26 PM] Launchpad: home charging takes longer I think
[11/2/17, 4:58:19 PM] Scott: That's a long time
[11/2/17, 5:17:00 PM] Dan Watts: Guess I'm not going to the jets game üò•

[11/2/17, 5:18:38 PM] Miller: 50% of the time it works every time
[11/2/17, 5:19:35 PM] Scott: "looking for attractive woman to pay her own way to accompany me to jets game.  as a friend.  nothing creepy."

[11/2/17, 9:36:16 PM] Miller: Lol

[11/3/17, 8:27:26 AM] Miller: so this guy bought gothamist just to shut it down?
[11/3/17, 8:27:52 AM] Scott: Didn't someone do that with gawker?
[11/3/17, 8:28:08 AM] Miller: he didnt buy it he just sued them into bankruptcy
[11/3/17, 8:28:29 AM] Scott: I thought after it was all over it was purchased by someone for a nominal figure and shut down.
[11/3/17, 8:29:42 AM] Miller: so i believe Gawker Media was sold and then gawker.com was shut down due to the associations w/the name but the rest of the websites (deadspin, gizmodo, jezebel etc...) all stayed open
[11/3/17, 8:30:30 AM] Scott: I see
[11/3/17, 8:30:41 AM] Scott: Gizmodo who comes up with these names ?
[11/3/17, 8:31:27 AM] Miller: i dont really think youre in a position to give anyone shit for coming up with bad names
[11/3/17, 8:32:34 AM] Scott: So says you and your meh opinion.
[11/3/17, 8:33:17 AM] Donk: new poll for the site: Whats Worse? Cheese's Jokes or Cheese
[11/3/17, 8:33:22 AM] Donk: 's comebacks
[11/3/17, 8:33:32 AM] Scott: Equally as perfect.
[11/3/17, 8:34:02 AM] Miller: should add 2 more categories
[11/3/17, 8:34:05 AM] Miller: cheeses team names
[11/3/17, 8:34:09 AM] Miller: cheeses trade offers
[11/3/17, 8:34:19 AM] Miller: btw anyone can create polls (steve created the most recent one)
[11/3/17, 8:59:58 AM] Dan Watts: A bunch of writers decided to unionize
[11/3/17, 9:00:01 AM] Dan Watts: So he canned them
[11/3/17, 9:09:55 AM] Miller: this woman working here just graduated from binghamton, she told me nirchis not only does not deliver any longer but they are only open on the weekends
[11/3/17, 9:10:19 AM] Scott: All nirchis?
[11/3/17, 9:16:13 AM] Donk: yeah, somehow i doubt that
[11/3/17, 9:20:00 AM] Miller: seemed odd
[11/3/17, 9:20:08 AM] Miller: maybe she thought i was talking about something else
[11/3/17, 9:20:47 AM] Scott: They would lose a lot of money of they did that
[11/3/17, 9:20:59 AM] Miller: how much?
[11/3/17, 9:21:13 AM] Scott: About a tree fiddy
[11/3/17, 11:01:17 AM] Launchpad: SALT?
[11/3/17, 11:01:33 AM] Miller: state and local taxes
[11/3/17, 11:02:10 AM] Donk: yeah, i pulled out my taxes out from last year, and its going to cost me
[11/3/17, 11:02:31 AM] Donk: salt and property taxes alone
[11/3/17, 11:02:35 AM] Donk: hopefully it wont go through
[11/3/17, 11:02:37 AM] Launchpad: Im going to get destroyed on capital gains next year
[11/3/17, 11:02:50 AM] Donk: yeah, but thats a good thing
[11/3/17, 11:02:55 AM] Donk: it means you had capital gains
[11/3/17, 11:03:01 AM] Launchpad: yea true
[11/3/17, 11:03:43 AM] Launchpad: wish I didn't sell any damn bitcoin though
[11/3/17, 11:13:49 AM] Dan Watts: SALT makes me salty!!!
[11/3/17, 11:15:55 AM] Donk: not to mention that by limiting property tax deductions, and capping new mortgage deductions that it is going to negatively impact housing values in our area
[11/3/17, 11:16:10 AM] Donk: as the cost of owning a home is essentially going to increase
[11/3/17, 11:16:40 AM] Launchpad: Time to go long stocks and cryptos
[11/3/17, 11:16:44 AM] Donk: not that i am moving anytime in the forseeable future, but still, annoying
[11/3/17, 1:03:43 PM] Miller: just had a hot dog to celebrate #nationalsandwichday

[11/3/17, 1:39:44 PM] Scott: Da fuk
[11/3/17, 3:22:18 PM] Miller: https://www.someecards.com/entertainment/celebrities/chrissy-teigen-waitress-tip/ cant wait for this episode of NFY
[11/3/17, 3:23:31 PM] Launchpad: NFY?
[11/3/17, 3:24:58 PM] Launchpad: what is NFY
[11/3/17, 3:26:09 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjIKnetfo0A
[11/3/17, 3:41:53 PM] Launchpad: Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) is considering a bid of more than $100 billion for smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Bloomberg reported on Friday, in what could be the biggest-ever chip deal.
[11/3/17, 4:00:39 PM] Donk: wow lol
[11/3/17, 4:00:44 PM] Donk: thats great
[11/3/17, 4:00:51 PM] Donk: id probably also vote do it
[11/3/17, 4:02:05 PM] Miller: oh 150%
[11/3/17, 4:02:32 PM] Donk: o's champ for eli getting hurt? probably a benefit to the giants too lol
[11/3/17, 4:02:42 PM] Donk: (but dont tell launchpad that)
[11/3/17, 4:15:10 PM] Brian Katz: If it was a yankees WS win or Eli Manning....... sorry Eli lol
[11/3/17, 4:21:46 PM] Launchpad: seeing that Eli is like 37 I could do that
[11/3/17, 4:22:11 PM] Launchpad: not for an O's champ gtfo donk you'd have to 'sacrifice' flacco üòÇ
[11/3/17, 4:28:30 PM] Donk: lol, fine with me
[11/3/17, 4:28:32 PM] Donk: poor tk though
[11/3/17, 4:30:43 PM] Miller: Pretty sure someone already did sacrifice Flacco
[11/3/17, 4:31:05 PM] Launchpad: they sacrificed something to get him a ring
[11/3/17, 4:31:11 PM] Launchpad: the Orioles maybe?
[11/3/17, 5:04:20 PM] Dan Watts: That's hilarious
[11/3/17, 5:30:05 PM] Launchpad: https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/11/lowest-point.aspx
[11/3/17, 5:30:20 PM] Launchpad: Nearly two-thirds of Americans (63 percent) say the future of the nation is a very or somewhat significant source of stress, slightly more than perennial stressors like money (62 percent) and work (61 percent), according to the American Psychological Association‚Äôs report, "Stress in America‚Ñ¢: The State of Our Nation".

More than half of Americans (59 percent) said they consider this the lowest point in U.S. history that they can remember ‚Äî a figure spanning every generation, including those who lived through World War II and Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
[11/3/17, 5:30:55 PM] Launchpad: "Lowest point in US history"......bunch of snowflakes around here
[11/3/17, 5:32:11 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm enjoying this point in America tbh. Things are going swell for me and most of friends right now.
[11/3/17, 5:32:48 PM] Launchpad: personal business is booming
[11/3/17, 5:33:11 PM] Launchpad: the more you watch the news the more jaded your outlook becomes
[11/3/17, 5:34:12 PM] Brian Katz: Water off a ducks back mi amigo
[11/3/17, 5:36:08 PM] Miller: I'd enjoy it more if I didn't just get a negative 30k or so annuity this week
[11/3/17, 5:36:34 PM] Miller: I'm gonna need this podcast to make about 80k next year to keep me whole
[11/3/17, 5:37:24 PM] Launchpad: market woes or tax plan woes?
[11/3/17, 5:38:31 PM] Miller: Taxes
[11/3/17, 5:38:50 PM] Miller: I would never extrapolate anything that happens market related
[11/3/17, 5:39:28 PM] Miller: California has the highest salt in the country so you'll find out soon enough
[11/3/17, 5:40:06 PM] Brian Katz: I wouldn‚Äôt count on the podcast making you anything. In fact I‚Äôm at a net loss since started this venture.
[11/3/17, 5:40:09 PM] Launchpad: current taxes or based on what is in this bill which hasn't yet passed
[11/3/17, 5:40:59 PM] Miller: Proposal
[11/3/17, 5:41:39 PM] Launchpad: so you would extrapolate tax proposals, just not market hiccups
[11/3/17, 5:42:02 PM] Launchpad: so whats the part you get fucked with SALT?
[11/3/17, 5:42:21 PM] Launchpad: cause I saw you and Donk weren't happy with property tax deductions you can't take
[11/3/17, 5:42:26 PM] Launchpad: but that doesn't affect me
[11/3/17, 5:42:32 PM] Miller: That's a relatively small part of it
[11/3/17, 5:42:41 PM] Miller: You can no longer deduct your state taxes
[11/3/17, 5:42:51 PM] Donk: Yeah salt taxes is worse
[11/3/17, 5:43:17 PM] Launchpad: garbage
[11/3/17, 5:43:29 PM] Launchpad: so the raised standard deduction wont offset that
[11/3/17, 5:43:33 PM] Miller: California gets fucked the most followed by NYC
[11/3/17, 5:43:44 PM] Miller: Followed by non city ny and NJ
[11/3/17, 5:43:50 PM] Launchpad: time to move to Austin
[11/3/17, 5:44:18 PM] Miller: Not if you make any money
[11/3/17, 5:44:59 PM] Launchpad: kind of shitty
[11/3/17, 5:47:45 PM] Miller: Yea do the math then figure out how many more hours you need to work just to break even
[11/3/17, 5:58:34 PM] Launchpad: just gonna buy weed instead
[11/3/17, 5:58:56 PM] Brian Katz: Like a dime bag?
[11/3/17, 5:59:10 PM] Launchpad: companies
[11/3/17, 6:00:02 PM] Miller: Going to use your money you lost to invest? Seems like a good move if you can figure out a way
[11/3/17, 6:00:08 PM] Brian Katz: Like IBM?
[11/3/17, 6:01:02 PM] Miller: It would stand to reason if your take home goes down you actually have less money to invest
[11/3/17, 6:01:11 PM] Miller: But I'm not a doctor
[11/3/17, 6:01:31 PM] Launchpad: I meant Im just gonna do that now and hope this tax reform doesn't pass
[11/3/17, 6:01:47 PM] Launchpad: the not deducting SALT is in affect double taxation
[11/3/17, 6:02:31 PM] Miller: Not really?
[11/3/17, 6:03:24 PM] Miller: It is super lame and a complete fuck you to liberals though
[11/3/17, 6:11:58 PM] Justin: Hahaha
[11/3/17, 6:12:31 PM] Justin: That was pretty good.
[11/3/17, 6:13:08 PM] Justin: Yeh standard deduction is more for pleblocytes like myself. Not single men making in the six figures
[11/3/17, 6:13:43 PM] Miller: I'm guessing this isn't good for anyone with revenue from outside the US also such as Joya
[11/3/17, 6:13:55 PM] Miller: I haven't done any work on the international side though
[11/3/17, 6:14:24 PM] Launchpad: actually if you're single and only making income through a job you'll probably take the standard deduction
[11/3/17, 6:14:33 PM] Justin: Yes....that is true
[11/3/17, 6:14:43 PM] Justin: As is what I said
[11/3/17, 6:15:29 PM] Justin: Income shares a negative correlation w effective tax rate
[11/3/17, 6:16:23 PM] Justin: Oops positive
[11/3/17, 6:16:26 PM] Brian Katz: Who is income? And why is he sharing a negative correlation with effective tax rate?
[11/3/17, 6:16:36 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm bored don‚Äôt mind me
[11/3/17, 6:17:14 PM] Dan Watts: We Gucci
[11/3/17, 6:17:37 PM] Justin: Simple mo money mo problems
[11/3/17, 6:18:02 PM] Launchpad: I highly doubt that this could even be a factor until 2018 tax year
[11/3/17, 6:18:32 PM] Miller: They already said cannot back date it for 2017
[11/3/17, 6:18:33 PM] Justin: Lol
[11/3/17, 6:18:47 PM] Launchpad: so thats good news
[11/3/17, 6:19:03 PM] Launchpad: cause I plan on not taking the standard deduction this year üòÇ
[11/3/17, 6:19:12 PM] Brian Katz: I like it
[11/3/17, 6:19:21 PM] Launchpad: sometimes I do though, depends on the year
[11/3/17, 6:19:43 PM] Launchpad: Im going to need a legit accountant this year
[11/3/17, 6:19:48 PM] Launchpad: I'm firing my current guy
[11/3/17, 6:24:49 PM] Launchpad: " In fact, the elimination of the credit could be spun as a positive for Tesla, since General Motors and Nissan were just getting started with their own electric efforts -- with the Chevy Bolt and Leaf, respectively. For the Bolt, which starts at $37,500 the tax credit represents a 20% savings off the list price. Without that benefit, the company will face a tougher task selling the car.

Tesla already built its electric profile with the help of the tax credit. GM and Nissan might not be so lucky.

Big Picture: The new tax reform bill removes a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers. For Tesla, the benefit was about to expire anyway. "
[11/3/17, 6:47:59 PM] Justin: i mean yeh i could write a press release to gm as well that says.  "thanks to Tesla spending a shit ton of money on the beginning phases of the technology, we get to come in and produce our electric cars at a fraction of the cost that company has to when it took on 100's of million in debt and loans"
[11/3/17, 6:48:15 PM] Justin: ill let GM know im available for print whenever they want
[11/3/17, 6:49:00 PM] Launchpad: you're going to write a press release to GM?
[11/3/17, 6:49:20 PM] Justin: i mean thats essentially what you just posted
[11/3/17, 6:49:33 PM] Justin: some guy giving a spin on economic relaity facing electric cars
[11/3/17, 6:49:46 PM] Justin: yes hes more qualified, no it doenst mean im wrong
[11/3/17, 6:51:29 PM] Launchpad: sure...
[11/3/17, 10:16:25 PM] Miller: Jesus this mummy movie with Tom cruise is already on Cinemax? Didn't it come out in theaters a few months ago?
[11/3/17, 10:20:24 PM] Miller: Disregard the tv guide is wrong it's the OG mummy with Brendan Frasier
[11/3/17, 10:22:29 PM] Scott: With Rachel weisz, holla.
[11/3/17, 10:31:12 PM] Justin: and not Billy Zane

[11/6/17, 7:28:02 PM] Justin: I always say libertarians are better than most.
[11/6/17, 7:29:04 PM] Justin: They get that nationalism is a stupid construct. We just differ on governments role in the economy( pretty big difference)
[11/6/17, 7:29:18 PM] Miller: Gary Johnson 2020?

[11/7/17, 7:50:27 AM] Miller: the committee estimated that in 2023, taxpayers making between $20,000 and $40,000 would see their taxes increase, a result of a series of tax credits in the plan that are set to expire after five years
[11/7/17, 7:50:30 AM] Miller: lol cant make this shit uop

[11/7/17, 1:06:28 PM] Justin: lawn mowers are just as bad as the nazis
[11/7/17, 1:07:17 PM] Launchpad: apparently that violent leftist had opposing political views
[11/7/17, 1:09:07 PM] Justin: oh really, i ddint get thats what you were implying at all, went over my head.....glad you read the article which said it had literally nothing to do with politics..
[11/7/17, 1:09:37 PM] Brian Katz: Is this a new racial term for Mexicans that I was not aware of?
[11/7/17, 1:09:43 PM] Justin: but continue to make a false equiolancy argument on something that doesnt even fit into what you want to fit it into in the first place
[11/7/17, 1:09:57 PM] Justin: no its using lp reasoning for the actual motives behing this guy being violent
[11/7/17, 1:10:17 PM] Justin: lp guy was socialist he hit a libertarian----rality they argued over flowers on tehir property and he hit his neighbor
[11/7/17, 1:10:43 PM] Justin: notice you would be a fucken asshole if you said landscapers are equally violent to nazis

[11/7/17, 1:11:50 PM] Justin: h "the precise provenance of the dispute was still a matter of disagreement," the Times notes. Two of the Kentuckians said the issue was "some sort of planting or flora issue around the properties," said Times reporter Jonathan Martin, while a third one said it revolved around "a small strip of land" that "leads to a manmade lake."

[11/7/17, 1:12:47 PM] Justin: continue to amke shitty arguements without logic and cry about them being called out for being shitty arguments
[11/7/17, 1:13:45 PM] Justin: i mean you pointed as this to prove leftists are as violent as nazis and the right...which in itself is stupid.  The fact that it turns out it had nothing to do with politics is just icing on the cake
[11/7/17, 1:14:14 PM] Launchpad: you're having an argument with yourself that you caused yourself

[11/8/17, 5:34:27 PM] Dan Watts: üíØ
[11/8/17, 5:34:27 PM] Miller: like it should not be that hard, just go alphabetically and have a way of knowing if someone is eligible or if they just did this
[11/8/17, 5:34:53 PM] Launchpad: mine is to make sarcastic statements so they think you're not ready to take this seriously

[11/9/17, 12:05:44 PM] Launchpad: uber is great out here, so much cheaper than taxis
[11/9/17, 12:05:49 PM] Miller: like i use uber occasionally but seems like common knowledge that its a complete POS company

[11/9/17, 12:06:42 PM] Sean: I love Uber, I don‚Äôt think any of us really don‚Äôt use something or watch something bc the company is a POS
[11/9/17, 12:06:49 PM] Scott: uber is a POS company
[11/9/17, 12:06:56 PM] Miller: if you have no alternatives, fine i get it
[11/9/17, 12:06:56 PM] Scott: but they all are
[11/9/17, 12:06:58 PM] Sean: So is the NFL and NCAA
[11/9/17, 12:07:00 PM] Scott: Lyft is terrible
[11/9/17, 12:07:02 PM] Miller: but theres 900 other options in NY
[11/9/17, 12:07:04 PM] Sean: But everyone still supports
[11/9/17, 12:07:08 PM] Scott: Juno/Gett are the absolute worst
[11/9/17, 12:07:12 PM] Miller: lyft at least pays the drivers more
[11/9/17, 12:07:13 PM] Scott: but ppl still use them
[11/9/17, 12:07:16 PM] Miller: juno is the best
[11/9/17, 12:07:20 PM] Miller: and VIA is pretty lit also
[11/9/17, 12:07:20 PM] Scott: Juno is the worst.
[11/9/17, 12:07:22 PM] Launchpad: I tip the drivers now
[11/9/17, 12:07:26 PM] Scott: Via is good, thats about it
[11/9/17, 12:07:32 PM] Scott: actually Juno by far and away is the worst
[11/9/17, 12:07:37 PM] Scott: the lawsuit by my office explains it all
[11/9/17, 12:07:43 PM] Launchpad: i don't even know if we have juno or via, can't be better
[11/9/17, 12:07:51 PM] Miller: forget your lawsuit
[11/9/17, 12:07:54 PM] Miller: talk to drivers
[11/9/17, 12:07:56 PM] Launchpad: we have lyft and uber
[11/9/17, 12:08:04 PM] Scott: Juno stole a shit ton of money form the drivers
[11/9/17, 12:08:10 PM] Scott: thorugh them being acquired by Gett
[11/9/17, 12:08:12 PM] Launchpad: and I pay $20 for the ride pass and its $6 rides for the month
[11/9/17, 12:08:21 PM] Scott: ask the drivers about that, they are pissed now
[11/9/17, 12:08:44 PM] Miller: didnt realize they had been acquired
[11/9/17, 12:08:52 PM] Miller: i will consider updating my rideshare power rankings
[11/9/17, 12:09:11 PM] Launchpad: did chuxing is still king
[11/9/17, 12:09:14 PM] Scott: so Juno induced its drivers to sign up by saying hey, if you want to sign up with us, we will give you shares int eh compnay, the compnay was acquired by Gett for $200 million and they didn't honor the agreement
[11/9/17, 12:09:17 PM] Launchpad: **didi chuxing
[11/9/17, 12:09:28 PM] Scott: the drivers are now waking up to it and are pissed
[11/9/17, 12:09:43 PM] Scott: so we filed a class actino securities suit with 2 other firms to get them their shares back or cash value
[11/9/17, 12:09:57 PM] Justin: Seems like uphill battle
[11/9/17, 12:10:09 PM] Scott: its a difficult case
[11/9/17, 12:10:18 PM] Scott: $$ investment pre-trial is low
[11/9/17, 12:10:19 PM] Justin: Does your form specilaize in mergers and acquisitions?
[11/9/17, 12:10:22 PM] Scott: so worth it
[11/9/17, 12:10:22 PM] Scott: no
[11/9/17, 12:10:27 PM] Scott: there are 3 firms on it
[11/9/17, 12:10:29 PM] Justin: Seems like their lawyers will
[11/9/17, 12:10:52 PM] Miller: damn RIP juno
[11/9/17, 12:11:03 PM] Scott: one firm is big in M&A, the other firm is big in corporate securities work, and our firm through me has class action large scale litigation experience
[11/9/17, 12:11:12 PM] Miller: still no reason to use uber over lyft unless you have no other option
[11/9/17, 12:11:14 PM] Scott: they have a few big firms nonetheless lol
[11/9/17, 12:11:20 PM] Scott: Juno for consumers is best
[11/9/17, 12:11:23 PM] Scott: its cheapest on average
[11/9/17, 12:11:35 PM] Scott: and the wait time is less than Uber/Lyft b/c lots of drivers not as many users know about it yet
[11/9/17, 12:12:10 PM] Scott: the real trick is VIA for a private car which they do now, is cheapest on average
[11/9/17, 12:12:15 PM] Scott: but not many drivers are using that function yet
[11/9/17, 12:12:17 PM] Launchpad: sure there is
[11/9/17, 12:13:16 PM] Launchpad: im surprised the card doesn't actually give discounts on uber rides
[11/9/17, 12:13:51 PM] Justin: Cheese gonna open up a law firm specializing in  self-contracted taxi litigation
[11/9/17, 12:14:09 PM] Scott: lol
[11/9/17, 12:14:36 PM] Justin: Gonna be teaching a class on it at Columbia on the side
[11/9/17, 12:15:01 PM] Scott: lol
[11/9/17, 12:15:16 PM] Scott: already lectured once at MBA program at Adelphi, its basically right there.
[11/9/17, 12:16:06 PM] Justin: Yeh instead of free labor you get like 12k/ semester stipend
[11/9/17, 12:16:14 PM] Scott: id take it.
[11/9/17, 12:16:20 PM] Scott: i hear its alot of work tho
[11/9/17, 12:16:21 PM] Justin: Lol no you wouldn't
[11/9/17, 12:16:24 PM] Scott: and overrated
[11/9/17, 12:16:41 PM] Justin: Yeh hourly probably like 4$ hr
[11/9/17, 12:17:06 PM] Miller: id take it
[11/9/17, 12:17:25 PM] Scott: how do you gather $4/hr?
[11/9/17, 12:18:03 PM] Justin: Just spitballing.
[11/9/17, 12:18:09 PM] Justin: Could be 10$ hr
[11/9/17, 12:18:22 PM] Miller: could even be a boat
[11/9/17, 12:19:02 PM] Scott: resume builder nonetheless
[11/9/17, 12:19:08 PM] Launchpad: ill take the boat
[11/9/17, 12:19:15 PM] Launchpad: gas included?
[11/9/17, 12:19:34 PM] Launchpad: Correction: 2%
[11/9/17, 12:20:07 PM] Miller: *gas and docking fees extra
[11/9/17, 12:20:17 PM] Scott: was about to say, i feel like htat it should discount uber rides
[11/9/17, 12:20:30 PM] Scott: 2% is barely an incentive when juno runs way below that compared to other services
[11/9/17, 12:20:40 PM] Donk: do you juggle different credits cards based on what purchases you are making to maximize the cash back/miles/etc bonus?
[11/9/17, 12:21:01 PM] Scott: http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/06/20/drivers-for-ride-hailing-apps-juno-and-gett-sue-companies-for-securities-fraud-over-broken-promises.html
[11/9/17, 12:21:04 PM] Miller: i have amazon set to my amazon visa card
[11/9/17, 12:21:13 PM] Miller: otherwise everything goes on my amex
[11/9/17, 12:21:38 PM] Launchpad: I was using amazon for restaurants which gets 2%
[11/9/17, 12:21:53 PM] Launchpad: and also for gas & drug stores
[11/9/17, 12:22:24 PM] Scott: what does amazon visa get you on amazon purchases?
[11/9/17, 12:22:32 PM] Launchpad: 5% off
[11/9/17, 12:22:37 PM] Miller: ive had good experiences w/amex in terms of any problems ive ever had so i am probably sacrificing a point or two of rewards on certain purchases but seems worth it to me
[11/9/17, 12:24:16 PM] Donk: ive just been use discover for everything, its 2% across the board plus rotating quarterly 5% cash back categories
[11/9/17, 12:24:30 PM] Donk: debating whether is worth or not to look into something else
[11/9/17, 12:25:14 PM] Scott: AMEX is exceptional for almost everything, i have the AMEX gold card and i never have any issues, highly suggest it.
[11/9/17, 12:25:32 PM] Miller: the fact cheese is willing to pay for something he could get for free says it all
[11/9/17, 12:25:40 PM] Miller: i actually still use the free amex blue card
[11/9/17, 12:26:20 PM] Brian Katz: Amex gold offers deep discounts on seasonal sam adams
[11/9/17, 12:27:59 PM] Kiyoon: damn should I be off the chase bandwagon?
[11/9/17, 12:28:03 PM] Scott: amex gold is much better than amex blue
[11/9/17, 12:28:04 PM] Scott: fyi.
[11/9/17, 12:28:26 PM] Scott: i accrue a stupid amount of miles so my travel is basically free every year wherever i go.
[11/9/17, 12:28:41 PM] Kiyoon: and where have you gone
[11/9/17, 12:28:50 PM] Kiyoon: OOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUU
[11/9/17, 12:29:02 PM] Scott: the trips we go on each year
[11/9/17, 12:29:12 PM] Scott: and if i was to travel it would be basically free less a $25 service charge each way
[11/9/17, 12:29:16 PM] Kiyoon: did you go to Austin this year
[11/9/17, 12:29:34 PM] Scott: no, too busy slaying shit to go. my bad.
[11/9/17, 12:29:50 PM] Donk: ?
[11/9/17, 12:29:54 PM] Miller: how so
[11/9/17, 12:30:09 PM] Kiyoon: you coulda slayed in Austin
[11/9/17, 12:31:14 PM] Scott: https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/premier-rewards-gold/
[11/9/17, 12:31:25 PM] Scott: uber kid.  had to do work to get the settlement done.
[11/9/17, 12:31:33 PM] Scott: my cut on uber > austin
[11/9/17, 12:31:54 PM] Miller: i read that, can you explain to me why its better in english
[11/9/17, 12:32:08 PM] Miller: very simply the fee is $95, what am i getting for that
[11/9/17, 12:32:29 PM] Scott: it has basically all the base line benefits of the blue card plus all sorts of travel benefits and extra redemptions on select offers only for gold and higher
[11/9/17, 12:32:34 PM] Scott: like a shit ton of shopping offers etc.
[11/9/17, 12:32:51 PM] Donk: plus the card is gold and shiny
[11/9/17, 12:33:08 PM] Scott: üëåüèº
[11/9/17, 12:33:18 PM] Miller: yea you have not convinced me of anything
[11/9/17, 12:33:45 PM] Miller: i already get all those shopping offers and the travel stuff seems very theoretical
[11/9/17, 12:34:47 PM] Scott: wait hold up
[11/9/17, 12:34:48 PM] Scott: https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/platinum/?eep=25330&linknav=US-Acq-CCSG-Prospect-CardDetails-PRG-Platinum-CardArt-Pos1
[11/9/17, 12:34:54 PM] Scott: thats amex platinum and has uber benefits
[11/9/17, 12:47:18 PM] Launchpad: Uber Rides With Platinum‚Ä°

Enjoy Uber VIP status and free rides in the U.S. up to $15 each month, plus a bonus $20 in December. That can be up to $200 in annual Uber savings.1
[11/9/17, 12:47:54 PM] Miller: thats the platinum
[11/9/17, 12:48:03 PM] Miller: i know you get tangible benefits from that card
[11/9/17, 12:48:07 PM] Miller: but its also $600/yr
[11/9/17, 12:48:18 PM] Miller: im more questioning what you get for the $95/yr gold fee
[11/9/17, 1:29:28 PM] Miller: Leigh Corfman says Roy Moore, the Republican Alabama Senate candidate, initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and he was 32, Washington Post reports, citing on-record interview with the Ala. woman.
[11/9/17, 1:29:35 PM] Miller: granted republicans elected a dude who body slammed someone the day before the election and a game show host who bragged about grabbing someones pussy so im sure this will have no dent on his candidacy
[11/9/17, 1:30:35 PM] Launchpad: in his defense he thought she was 12
[11/9/17, 1:30:49 PM] Justin: in his defense his public stances are already beyong rediculous
[11/9/17, 1:31:11 PM] Justin: they include losing his judgeship for refusing to follow court rulings
[11/9/17, 1:32:26 PM] Justin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC1aLBYVz34
[11/9/17, 1:33:22 PM] Miller: in the publics defense theres a big difference b/w having odd or disagreeable public stances and sexually assaulting a 14 year old
[11/9/17, 1:36:24 PM] Justin: if you are fine with all the shit he is saying, you probably are fine with him raping a 14 year old, afterall she was probably dressing like a slut and tempted him and the bible doesnt restrict sex by age
[11/9/17, 1:36:45 PM] Justin: plus its probbaly all made up by liberal media anyway
[11/9/17, 1:36:42 PM] Miller: FALSE EQUIVALENCY
[11/9/17, 1:36:45 PM] Miller: strawman!
[11/9/17, 1:37:25 PM] Justin: lol
[11/9/17, 1:38:05 PM] Justin: you willget to use it correctly against me one of these days
[11/9/17, 1:39:39 PM] Launchpad: signed up for that uber card

[11/9/17, 2:34:54 PM] Justin: i dont fucken know it was on my facebook
[11/9/17, 2:34:57 PM] Justin: blame the russians
[11/9/17, 2:34:59 PM] Miller: which is why "the internet" didnt break and everyone just ignored her
[11/9/17, 2:35:26 PM] Justin: could have clicked on the breitbart link as well im sure
[11/9/17, 3:32:34 PM] Launchpad: Couldn't even break 12 comments in group chat
[11/9/17, 4:18:30 PM] Miller: The Senate GOP tax plan released Nov. 9 follows the House‚Äôs example and doesn‚Äôt make changes to 401(k) plans
[11/9/17, 4:21:46 PM] Miller: also the senate plan removes the 10k property tax exemption and completely eliminates all SALT exemptions
[11/9/17, 4:21:47 PM] Miller: enjoy!
[11/9/17, 4:22:15 PM] Launchpad: why would you shocked that I didn't post unsubstantiated garbage from a christian website?
[11/9/17, 4:32:43 PM] Launchpad: Damn now they cummin for louis ck https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/arts/television/louis-ck-sexual-misconduct.html
[11/9/17, 4:33:02 PM] Miller: havent they been for a while?
[11/9/17, 4:33:07 PM] Miller: he was accused of jerking off on some chick
[11/9/17, 4:33:09 PM] Launchpad: What kind of world do we live in in which a guy can't even pull out his dick and wank it when he wants to anymore?
[11/9/17, 4:34:27 PM] Dan Watts: I recently was talking to this girl on tinder and this the only sexual act she allowed me to perform. Was not down with anything else
[11/9/17, 4:34:44 PM] Miller: eh
[11/9/17, 4:34:46 PM] Miller: could be worse lol
[11/9/17, 4:35:07 PM] Dan Watts: lmao them is straight facts
[11/9/17, 4:37:18 PM] Brian Katz: She allowed you to jerk off on her? That‚Äôs it? Weird
[11/9/17, 4:38:21 PM] Launchpad: when you came, did she rub it in her skin like lotion?
[11/9/17, 4:39:05 PM] Dan Watts: she basically exposed her breasts and was like you can jerk off in front me if you want
[11/9/17, 4:39:11 PM] Dan Watts: i said thats it
[11/9/17, 4:39:13 PM] Dan Watts: she said that's it
[11/9/17, 4:39:17 PM] Dan Watts: so i did
[11/9/17, 4:39:43 PM] Launchpad: well I mean you cant waste a perfectly fine boob show
[11/9/17, 4:39:51 PM] Donk: lol
[11/9/17, 4:39:57 PM] Miller: "you can jerk off"
"anything else?"
"nope"
"ill take it"
[11/9/17, 4:40:10 PM] Dan Watts: lol thats exactly how it went down
[11/9/17, 4:40:22 PM] Scott: lol
[11/9/17, 4:40:35 PM] Scott: that is bizarre
[11/9/17, 4:47:29 PM] Brian Katz: Were her tits an A1 set?
[11/9/17, 4:48:00 PM] Dan Watts: A2
[11/9/17, 4:48:21 PM] Dan Watts: by far and away her best quality
[11/9/17, 4:49:01 PM] Dan Watts: i was kind of concerned bc she had a 3 yo kid and theres no way that kid ever put his mouth on those things bc they were pristine
[11/9/17, 4:50:08 PM] Scott: @17189742074 you eating chicken schnitzel tonight wtih your girl?
[11/9/17, 4:53:40 PM] Dan Watts: nah one schnitzel a week is good for me bro

[11/9/17, 4:59:11 PM] Dan Watts: tudo de bom pra voce
[11/9/17, 5:01:03 PM] Scott: holla.
[11/9/17, 5:01:30 PM] Dan Watts: to fill everyone else in, cheese and i went to this german spot and our waitress was from brazil and i hit her with a little portuguese i picked up over the years. she was about it but i pussied out didn't ask for her number bc can't exclude the more likely possibility she was responding well bc she wanted a nice tip
[11/9/17, 5:01:55 PM] Scott: not gonna lie, let me #cheese-pressed
[11/9/17, 5:03:47 PM] Miller: Just leave your number on the receipt
[11/9/17, 5:06:52 PM] Launchpad: thats why I don't waste my energy flirting with waitresses & bartenders
[11/9/17, 5:07:15 PM] Sean: I have slept with 2 when the night was over
[11/9/17, 5:07:19 PM] Launchpad: how many guys do you know actually banged a girl they met as a customer??
[11/9/17, 5:07:21 PM] Sean: Not sure if it‚Äôs easier in my world
[11/9/17, 5:07:42 PM] Sean: One was from the beer garden in Astoria and the other gay bar in the city
[11/9/17, 5:07:56 PM] Launchpad: about 1000%
[11/9/17, 5:08:09 PM] Scott: seems accurate.
[11/9/17, 5:08:19 PM] Sean: In general yes but maybe not in that situation
[11/9/17, 7:11:16 PM] Miller: @ken keep pretending there isn't even a debate
[11/9/17, 7:21:31 PM] Brian Katz: Fuck jebron lames. Jordan the unequivocally GOAT
[11/9/17, 7:21:56 PM] Brian Katz: no debate needed. Fuck that nerd and his stupid tie
[11/9/17, 7:22:18 PM] Miller: Tl Dr get off my lawn
[11/9/17, 7:25:48 PM] Donk: Guy makes some great points
[11/9/17, 7:26:12 PM] Donk: Pretty spot on
[11/9/17, 7:26:23 PM] Brian Katz: Guys a stat geek
[11/9/17, 7:26:56 PM] Donk: I also have space jam on in the background right now
[11/9/17, 7:27:07 PM] Miller: Lol please make an argument for Jordan being the GOAT without using stats
[11/9/17, 7:27:19 PM] Brian Katz: Lebron never had a hard eastern playoff match that he won.
[11/9/17, 7:27:57 PM] Donk: How is that lebrons fault?
[11/9/17, 7:27:58 PM] Scott: Not his fault
[11/9/17, 7:28:12 PM] Scott: Best movie.
[11/9/17, 7:29:28 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôve never witnessed a more dominant player. When Jordan came to play against my team I just knew he was going to beat us. Not Scottie or kucoc or any other bull. It was him. He was going to drop 40 on you in the biggest game of the season.
[11/9/17, 7:30:02 PM] Brian Katz: It is his fault. He teamed up with the best players in the east becyhe couldn‚Äôt beat the Celtics
[11/9/17, 7:30:30 PM] Miller: Bulls were a playoff team without him
[11/9/17, 7:30:39 PM] Brian Katz: So what
[11/9/17, 7:30:46 PM] Miller: Even in a supposedly very strong east
[11/9/17, 7:31:02 PM] Miller: And Kareem was more dominant I promise you that
[11/9/17, 7:31:53 PM] Scott: Again if that's the best argument u got that it's a run away then it's not. #o'chees'lrules
[11/9/17, 7:32:19 PM] Miller: So LeBron sucks because he played in a soft division yet when he left his team's they sucked, Jordan played in a harder competition and didn't go joining people to play on good teams and yet his team still made the playoffs without him
[11/9/17, 7:32:20 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese blows
[11/9/17, 7:33:04 PM] Miller: You realize you cannot simultaneously say LeBron had a better supporting cast and easier competition
[11/9/17, 7:33:28 PM] Brian Katz: Don‚Äôt care. If you were starting a imaginary team with every nba player available of all time, I‚Äôd take Jordan
[11/9/17, 7:34:30 PM] Miller: I'd take lil bow wow from like Mike
[11/9/17, 7:34:37 PM] Brian Katz: I didn‚Äôt say Lebron had a better supporting cast. I just he was bitch because he couldn‚Äôt beat the Celtics so he got together with the two best players in the east.
[11/9/17, 7:34:38 PM] Miller: Guy could dunk from half court
[11/9/17, 7:35:21 PM] Miller: So Jordan beats LeBron in the not a bitch category?
[11/9/17, 7:35:36 PM] Miller: So then do we need to consider if Oakley is actually the goat?
[11/9/17, 7:35:49 PM] Miller: I think he's the least bitch player in NBA history
[11/9/17, 7:36:04 PM] Brian Katz: I won‚Äôt watch the Knicks ever again until he‚Äôs allowed back in the garden
[11/9/17, 7:37:16 PM] Miller: More like Charles GOATkley amirite?
[11/9/17, 7:37:38 PM] Brian Katz: He was an awesome banger

[11/9/17, 9:21:02 PM] Sean: Dallas is amazing
[11/9/17, 9:21:18 PM] Sean: The whole thing is gonna come back to the cake every episode
[11/9/17, 9:21:42 PM] Justin: Isn't that jersey? ---me
[11/9/17, 9:22:28 PM] Miller: Those were 2 seperate thoughts presumably
[11/9/17, 9:22:47 PM] Sean: Yeah haha my bad
[11/9/17, 9:22:57 PM] Miller: Dallas she can totally skip season one, like read the Wikipedia or something but not necessary to watch it

[11/10/17, 9:42:59 AM] Miller: #reputation sold over 800K copies on US iTunes in its first hour of release, also becoming the FASTEST album to hit #1 in 6 minutes. üéß

The album is currently #1 in over 150+ countries.
[11/10/17, 9:44:12 AM] Miller: insane it took an hour for it to become the best selling album of 2017
[11/10/17, 9:44:30 AM] Miller: but shes an idiot for taking her music off spotify tho?
[11/10/17, 9:45:20 AM] Launchpad: and 63 million people voted for Donald Trump
[11/10/17, 9:45:25 AM] Launchpad: people have bad taste
[11/10/17, 9:45:52 AM] Miller: its true, i even know people who listen to dreamweaver
[11/10/17, 9:46:22 AM] Donk: thought she put it back on spotify?
[11/10/17, 9:46:52 AM] Miller: she put her back catalogue back on but shes not releasing this on streaming for an undetermined amount of time
[11/10/17, 9:46:56 AM] Miller: (probably a week)

[11/10/17, 12:29:53 PM] Donk: me
[11/10/17, 12:30:38 PM] Dan Watts: only reasonable explanation is she's a white supremist
[11/10/17, 12:59:18 PM] Miller: üóë
[11/10/17, 1:39:22 PM] Donk: anyone still read bill simmons weekly columns/mailbags?
[11/10/17, 1:39:37 PM] Donk: last week he was talking about how people tend to gravitate to jobs that fit their names
[11/10/17, 1:39:55 PM] Donk: and some reader sent him some info on a guy that he put int he mailbag this week
[11/10/17, 1:40:21 PM] Donk: he found a guy who is a urology dr who performs vasectomies and the guys name is richard chopp, ie Dr Dick Chopp

[11/10/17, 2:36:19 PM] Donk: its an intersting statement
[11/10/17, 2:54:38 PM] Justin: He apprently doesn't subscribe to the @16318489683 "just send her a dick pic" philosophy
[11/10/17, 2:54:55 PM] Scott: Fool
[11/10/17, 2:55:27 PM] Justin: Moral of story, never ask for permission ?
[11/10/17, 2:56:27 PM] Miller: question for HIMYM, is the naked man sexual assault?
[11/10/17, 2:57:30 PM] Justin: Probably is 9/10 times, but still percentage game
[11/10/17, 2:57:55 PM] Donk: not sexual assault
[11/10/17, 2:58:01 PM] Donk: but maybe sexual harrassment?
[11/10/17, 2:58:38 PM] Launchpad: "Madam, seeking permission to kiss you now"

[11/11/17, 11:35:51 AM] Scott: Lolol
[11/11/17, 11:36:04 AM] Scott: It did coincide with this oddly
[11/11/17, 12:28:04 PM] Miller: At this point it's just easier to get a list of people who aren't sexually assaulting people
[11/11/17, 12:28:39 PM] Scott: Jeez
[11/11/17, 12:28:58 PM] Scott: Is there a running list of this?
[11/11/17, 12:29:12 PM] Miller: Just assume all men in Hollywood
[11/11/17, 12:29:15 PM] Miller: Go from there
[11/11/17, 12:29:43 PM] Scott: Interesting.
[11/11/17, 4:33:15 PM] Miller: Well this Ric Flair 30 for 30 was super depressing
[11/11/17, 4:33:35 PM] Miller: I was prepared for it to be somewhat but it was worse

[11/13/17, 1:53:01 PM] Miller: that should seal it
[11/13/17, 2:13:21 PM] Justin: nah george soros paid for these actresses to pretend they were raped by this pedi, i can prove it
[11/13/17, 2:13:53 PM] Launchpad: she should change her name to Allgreen
[11/13/17, 2:16:29 PM] Launchpad: so no one
[11/13/17, 2:19:44 PM] Justin: i mean its a matter of perspective, as in infinitely more people know the term than the amount of people that follow MassRoots inc stock price
[11/13/17, 2:21:08 PM] Launchpad: I put it at 1 each
[11/13/17, 2:25:05 PM] Justin: honestly dont know how common it is, extremely common in my poker forums.  I'd asusme it's pretty common in any internet discussion dealing with a separation of US and the ROW
[11/13/17, 2:26:52 PM] Launchpad: its not
[11/13/17, 2:27:13 PM] Justin: i suppose you are king of the internet
[11/13/17, 2:27:27 PM] Justin: minutes ago i made the word up in your mind, so presumably
[11/13/17, 2:27:25 PM] Donk: seconded
[11/13/17, 2:27:59 PM] Donk: every internet forum type place ends up with its own slang/acronyms
[11/13/17, 2:28:31 PM] Donk: didnt you also have one from the same place that was the poker alternative of tldr?
[11/13/17, 2:28:45 PM] Justin: yeh was gonna say they use TLTR
[11/13/17, 2:28:53 PM] Justin: as in too long too read
[11/13/17, 2:29:11 PM] Donk: yeah, ive never seen that on the rest of the internet, its always tldr
[11/13/17, 2:29:37 PM] Justin: and perhaps thats because the limited forums you view elsewhere on internet?
[11/13/17, 2:29:49 PM] Justin: just saying using your own argument
[11/13/17, 2:30:10 PM] Donk: yes and no
[11/13/17, 2:30:25 PM] Donk: i would say that your poker forum is a very specific niche spot
[11/13/17, 2:30:38 PM] Donk: whereas tldr for example is pretty standard across a forum like reddit
[11/13/17, 2:31:06 PM] Donk: are there other internet forums i read with their own acronyms/memes/etc, yes
[11/13/17, 2:31:16 PM] Donk: but those are much more specific to that
[11/13/17, 2:33:37 PM] Miller: tldr is commonly used
[11/13/17, 2:38:27 PM] Justin: Could be that tltr is the hd-DVD
[11/13/17, 2:39:57 PM] Miller: i think the merits of tldlr was well covered and established in ROW v Wade
[11/13/17, 2:40:10 PM] Launchpad: lol
[11/13/17, 2:40:53 PM] Justin: Well look. Now you know an unnecessary acronym, you're welcome.
[11/13/17, 2:41:39 PM] Justin: Acronyms are one of the many reasons the ROW hates us
[11/13/17, 2:41:45 PM] Miller: i often use/see ROS for on fantasy twitter so i kind of instinctively knew what ROW was even though i dont think ive seen it before

[11/14/17, 1:02:00 PM] Justin: which is presumably extremely volatile?
[11/14/17, 1:02:23 PM] Launchpad: yup
[11/14/17, 1:02:28 PM] Justin: whats next emerging industry?
[11/14/17, 1:03:11 PM] Launchpad: but also, more importantly, I subscribe to paid research in which its the authors full time job to track down these companies / coins, make buy / sell recommendations & trade alerts
[11/14/17, 1:03:34 PM] Justin: so pretty much exactly like what miller just posted
[11/14/17, 1:03:56 PM] Launchpad: like a weed analyst?
[11/14/17, 1:04:23 PM] Justin: nah, like the pump and dump schemes on emerging crypto currency
[11/14/17, 1:04:45 PM] Launchpad: not quite
[11/14/17, 1:04:53 PM] Justin: its same research those investors are doing
[11/14/17, 1:05:18 PM] Justin: presumably you trust your researchers more, but that would also mean you are going to untrusted sources to find new emerging markets
[11/14/17, 1:05:35 PM] Justin: unless one source is in fact experts in several future areas of investment
[11/14/17, 1:06:13 PM] Launchpad: presumably you're looking for some sort of weakness in my methodology
[11/14/17, 1:06:14 PM] Justin: just saying, could be experiencing some run good, variance on such a volatile investment strategy is presumably rather large
[11/14/17, 1:06:45 PM] Launchpad: my investments are diverse and my risks are managed and understood
[11/14/17, 1:07:25 PM] Justin: i wouldnt understand the least about risk, but what percentage do you hold in emerging markets
[11/14/17, 1:09:21 PM] Launchpad: "Emerging markets" -- typcically means non-european or japanese (BRICs nations etc) - I don't own much in emerging markets, but I own a lot in emerging industries (weed, crypto
[11/14/17, 1:09:41 PM] Justin: %
[11/14/17, 1:09:36 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/14/17, 1:09:50 PM] Launchpad: I also own a lot of tech in ETFs
[11/14/17, 1:09:51 PM] Launchpad: lol
[11/14/17, 1:11:41 PM] Launchpad: crypto about 20%, weed about 35%, cash about 10%, and the rest is in Tech ETFs and dividend stocks
[11/14/17, 1:12:27 PM] Launchpad: and thats cause I took a bunch of crypto profits and put it in weed
[11/14/17, 1:13:31 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/14/17, 1:13:54 PM] Launchpad: hgod thats fucking gross
[11/14/17, 1:14:00 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[11/14/17, 1:14:35 PM] Launchpad: I had a catheter in once...I highly recommend never ever stretching the urethra under any circumstance
[11/14/17, 1:14:35 PM] Brian Katz: Did you ever want you dick to look like it was throwing up? Well you‚Äôre in luck
[11/14/17, 1:44:16 PM] Miller: oh cool another elementary school shooting
[11/14/17, 3:40:57 PM] Launchpad: PSA: These are the best gym shorts - super cheap, and have zippers on the pockets so you don't lose your shit https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073V5WK2F/ref=ox_sc_mini_detail?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A3BINKI1WV7BY5
[11/14/17, 3:42:10 PM] Miller: i hate shorts w/o zipper pockets, i approve
[11/14/17, 4:02:43 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUvVUMRlUU0&feature=youtu.be im sure nobody will appreciate this but its pretty maddening
[11/14/17, 4:03:38 PM] Donk: the carried interest loophole is fucking bullshit
[11/14/17, 4:03:50 PM] Donk: i dont understand how its still a thing tbh
[11/14/17, 4:04:04 PM] Donk: besides the obvious of rich people lobbying to keep benefits for rich people
[11/14/17, 4:09:14 PM] Miller: i am surprised it seemingly survived this
[11/14/17, 4:12:13 PM] Donk: im not tbh
[11/14/17, 4:12:24 PM] Donk: this is tax reform for the 1%, so makes sense that it would stay
[11/14/17, 4:12:35 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/14/17, 4:13:04 PM] Launchpad: lol
[11/14/17, 4:14:58 PM] Miller: its tax reform for corporations, the *.*.1% and people in red states
[11/14/17, 4:22:13 PM] Donk: thats fair, though tax reform for corporations does disproportionately benefit the 1% and up, so there is that.
[11/14/17, 4:22:28 PM] Miller: yea
[11/14/17, 4:28:48 PM] Launchpad: it also benefits those who own those corporations in their retirement accounts
[11/14/17, 4:29:44 PM] Donk: i did say dispropotionately
[11/14/17, 4:29:57 PM] Donk: i didnt say it only benefits them
[11/14/17, 4:30:54 PM] Launchpad: gotta start somewhere
[11/14/17, 4:31:31 PM] Launchpad: maybe by the time youre an old white man, you will have accumulated enough wealth so that people hate you
[11/14/17, 4:31:44 PM] Donk: lol
[11/14/17, 4:31:48 PM] Donk: sit down launchapd
[11/14/17, 4:32:10 PM] Launchpad: Im working on that one more reason for people to hate me
[11/14/17, 4:32:20 PM] Launchpad: besides annoying, obnoxious and cocky
[11/14/17, 4:32:31 PM] Miller: well you already look old so thats a start
[11/14/17, 4:32:39 PM] Miller: im sure you will get old one day though
[11/14/17, 4:34:28 PM] Miller: cant wait for the analysis on what your net benefit is when you figure out how much take home income you lost and how much $ you would have made if you invested all that lost takehome income into bitcoin and/or weed stocks
[11/14/17, 4:34:42 PM] Miller: but im sure it will be outweighed by your 14k/yr 401k investments going up an extra 1-2% possibly
[11/14/17, 4:38:39 PM] Donk: the carried interest loophole btw has nothing to do with me hating the 1% launchpad, its just about me wanting people to be taxed on their income, the same as you and me
[11/14/17, 4:38:55 PM] Donk: similar to my anger about the parsonage loophole for clergy
[11/14/17, 4:40:00 PM] Scott: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/14/17, 4:40:35 PM] Miller: god kiyoons FB is like a goldmine
[11/14/17, 4:40:44 PM] Miller: how long before i get blocked?
[11/14/17, 4:42:04 PM] Miller: the worst part about the carried interest loophole is it doesnt benefit me but it should? i dont really know how that works
[11/14/17, 4:42:18 PM] Miller: like i wish my income was taxed at 24%
[11/14/17, 4:42:37 PM] Miller: might have something to do w/holding periods
[11/14/17, 4:43:35 PM] Brian Katz: Damn you can‚Äôt just like the pic and be happy for him? Lol
[11/14/17, 4:50:02 PM] Miller: even my k1 income in the fund gets taxed at ordinary income
[11/14/17, 4:55:10 PM] Miller: 1yr holding period
[11/14/17, 4:55:11 PM] Miller: makes sense
[11/14/17, 4:56:31 PM] Miller: fwiw i dont know of a single HF that could take advantage of that
[11/14/17, 6:08:19 PM] Justin: riddle for you, in your mind                                                                                                   1. monetary expansion driving the market isn't causing inflation                                     2. bitcoin at 7k isn't a bubble?                                                                                               Seems impressively impossible for those two statements to be true
[11/14/17, 6:15:24 PM] Justin: essentially I still have no idea who gets to take advantage of carried interest loophole, but this is fucken maddeining.  She gets healthcare and a lofty salary and has no idea wtf carried interest is as the chair of the budget committee, that's insane
[11/14/17, 6:15:32 PM] Brian Katz: Is the answer white dick?
[11/14/17, 6:16:01 PM] Launchpad: 1. Invest your money so you beat inflation
2. A lot of smart people have said it would go to 100k or even a million. When it was $200, 7k sounded like an old wives tale
[11/14/17, 6:16:29 PM] Launchpad: I'll take Your Mom, for $14 Alex
[11/14/17, 6:18:40 PM] Brian Katz: Terrible yo momma joke
[11/14/17, 6:20:26 PM] Brian Katz: Launchpad have you gotten to party city yet? All Halloween costumes are steeply discounted, and you do need an outfit for Fienberg‚Äôs wedding
[11/14/17, 6:20:50 PM] Launchpad: nah I got groupon for that
[11/14/17, 6:21:09 PM] Dan Watts: @16195657200 wearing that tuxedo t-shirt
[11/14/17, 6:21:25 PM] Brian Katz: May I suggest butterfly wings and a wolf man outfit
[11/14/17, 6:21:27 PM] Kiyoon: Cheese just jealous
[11/14/17, 6:21:41 PM] Launchpad: BTP Formal Tux complete with G-Unit sneakers
[11/14/17, 6:21:46 PM] Dan Watts: http://6dollarshirts.com/tuxedo-shirt?language=en&currency=USD&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-4nkrJq_1wIVlIKzCh29kg4CEAQYASABEgKciPD_BwE
[11/14/17, 6:21:47 PM] Launchpad: ~kai~
[11/14/17, 6:22:12 PM] Launchpad: GTFO I only wear the $19.99 tuxedo shirt
[11/14/17, 6:31:50 PM] Launchpad: were you just trying to start a discussion and walk away?
[11/14/17, 6:32:13 PM] Scott: Happy for u. Not jealous at all.
[11/14/17, 6:38:26 PM] Justin: No i just thought a generic statement on inflation triggered by reading the word "inflation", wasn't an appropriate answer that required further evaluation.                   TLTR- you didn't answer the riddle
[11/14/17, 6:39:17 PM] Launchpad: what makes you think bitcoin is in a bubble? Price? Is that your only deciding factor?
[11/14/17, 6:39:31 PM] Justin: it relates to the first question
[11/14/17, 6:40:48 PM] Justin: if bitcoin will go to a million, what does that say about the current monetary environment?  Anotherwords what is the dollar worth when bitcoin is a "million".
[11/14/17, 6:41:02 PM] Launchpad: are you suggesting that money expanding is causing inflation and thats why bitcoin is at 7 thousand?
[11/14/17, 6:41:37 PM] Justin: im saying that its much more likely that monetary expansion to some degree is causing a rise in bitcoin value, yes
[11/14/17, 6:42:02 PM] Justin: its an alternative commodity of exchange, a direct competitor to fiat currency
[11/14/17, 6:42:29 PM] Justin: otherwise its just a useless bubble with no inherent value and equivalent to tulips
[11/14/17, 6:44:50 PM] Justin: so the likely answer is its a little bit of both( inflation is higher than reported, bitcoin is partially a bubble).  The impossible answer is that both 1 and  2 can exist as stated
[11/14/17, 6:45:06 PM] Launchpad: or maybe that its only worth about 110 billion, roughly the same size as Kraft Heinz?
[11/14/17, 6:45:32 PM] Launchpad: yes monetary expansion leads to inflation in prices
[11/14/17, 6:45:44 PM] Justin: except bitcoin is a currency not a corporation
[11/14/17, 6:45:48 PM] Launchpad: and a booming market, and job growth & low unemployment
[11/14/17, 6:45:50 PM] Launchpad: whats your point
[11/14/17, 6:46:25 PM] Justin: my point is for it to gain value, the dollar needs to lose value
[11/14/17, 6:46:51 PM] Justin: or as it gains value as a currency its relative buying power increases and the dollar buying power decreases
[11/14/17, 6:48:06 PM] Launchpad: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization
[11/14/17, 6:49:10 PM] Justin: brilliant
[11/14/17, 6:49:33 PM] Justin: im sure the banks and corporations holding trillions in dolalrs will be thrilled to be displaced by such technology
[11/14/17, 6:49:40 PM] Justin: what could that possibly so to the value of the dollar
[11/14/17, 6:50:08 PM] Justin: might as well say goodbye to that portfolio thats held in anything other than bitcoin at that point
[11/14/17, 6:50:13 PM] Launchpad: we'll find out
[11/14/17, 6:50:44 PM] Launchpad: Why do you think Jamie Dimon is out there calling Bitcoin a fraud?
[11/14/17, 6:51:10 PM] Justin: why do you think the federal government would ever let that happen?
[11/14/17, 6:51:22 PM] Justin: would bankrupt 100's of millions of people
[11/14/17, 6:52:14 PM] Justin: not to mention, eliminate the governments entire ability to create money
[11/14/17, 6:53:38 PM] Launchpad: why do you think that banks and governments wont embrace crypto technology?
[11/14/17, 6:53:53 PM] Launchpad: (Ignoring for a fact that they already are)
[11/14/17, 6:54:05 PM] Justin: "This approach eliminates the need to involve a bilaterally accepted trusted third party in a financial transaction, thus simplifying the sequence"
[11/14/17, 6:55:07 PM] Launchpad: Or maybe we can live in a world in which both systems co-exist? Like the world we're actually living in now
[11/14/17, 6:59:06 PM] Justin: i suppose we shall see, idk enough about blockchain.  I just consider the idea that one could hold their money in a bitcoin wallet for free, with less fraud, and instantaneously process transactions at low cost,  as a pretty dangerous competitor for a banking system.
[11/14/17, 7:00:27 PM] Launchpad: Its evidently clear when having this argument with you
[11/14/17, 7:01:18 PM] Justin: i mean, coming from the guy who hears the word inflation and repeats the mantra "beat inflation", thats pretty hurtful
[11/14/17, 7:02:55 PM] Scott: üí£üí£üí£üí£üí£üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
[11/14/17, 7:03:44 PM] Launchpad: You're asking questions that the world has been answering for the last 5 years
[11/14/17, 7:05:20 PM] Justin: you are talking about introducing a technology that completely decentralizes banking, point me to how BOA will be able to compete with the thousands of banks that come into the equation with no physical banking costs?
[11/14/17, 7:07:26 PM] Launchpad: the banks will build their own private blockchain they have control over
[11/14/17, 7:07:30 PM] Justin: Gladly await you pointing me to the 5 year old article explaining that from those expert advisers that are giving this advise monthly at one low cost of 9.99
[11/14/17, 7:07:55 PM] Justin: thats fine, they adopt this technology, it will save them billions.....now how do they hold off competitors?
[11/14/17, 7:08:24 PM] Scott: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/14/17, 7:08:32 PM] Launchpad: Keep hurling insults. I'm making actual real money on world changing technology while your peddling doomsday smut
[11/14/17, 7:09:01 PM] Justin: fair enough
[11/14/17, 7:09:09 PM] Launchpad: I don't know...how does BMW hold off competition
[11/14/17, 7:09:23 PM] Justin: government regulation and high cost of entry?
[11/14/17, 7:09:32 PM] Justin: next?
[11/14/17, 7:10:10 PM] Launchpad: innovate maybe?
[11/14/17, 7:11:05 PM] Justin: thats what adopting the technology to lower their costs is
[11/14/17, 7:11:17 PM] Launchpad: maybe they just become less powerful
[11/14/17, 7:11:54 PM] Launchpad: or can that not happen in your 100% correct doomsday model of the world
[11/14/17, 7:13:12 PM] Justin: its not doomsday as much as it is if this technology is as revolutionary as its claimed to be, its doubtful it will be met with open arms
[11/14/17, 7:14:10 PM] Launchpad: Maybe if you want to do something for humanity than embrace it???
[11/14/17, 7:14:56 PM] Justin: embraced
[11/14/17, 7:14:57 PM] Launchpad: instead of doing mental gymnastics to assume ever little issue you come up with means impending doom
[11/14/17, 7:15:11 PM] Justin: technically need to cashout in bitcoin some money i through on foreign site
[11/14/17, 7:15:22 PM] Launchpad: The CFTC just made a decision to all for trading of bitcoin futures
[11/14/17, 7:15:44 PM] Launchpad: create a coinbase account and link it to your bank account
[11/14/17, 7:16:12 PM] Launchpad: Coinbase is a completely new bank -- and operating well within the law - "Competition"
[11/14/17, 7:16:12 PM] Justin: think i made a coinbase account couple months ago
[11/14/17, 7:18:17 PM] Justin: something tells me this is more the future https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2017/10/18/chinas-blockchain-bitcoin-ban-no-match-for-stateless-cryptocurrency-market/#40a8f1062de6
[11/14/17, 7:18:34 PM] Justin: i udnerstand the premise is "China loses out"
[11/14/17, 7:24:25 PM] Launchpad: First of all they didn't ban bitcoin. They banned ICOs and exchange based trading against the yuan
[11/14/17, 7:24:54 PM] Launchpad: You can still own and transact in bitcoin
[11/14/17, 11:58:14 PM] Kiyoon: Should Kentucky hold the ball for the final shot here???
[11/14/17, 11:58:47 PM] Brian Katz: Always
[11/15/17, 1:10:52 PM] Miller: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bustle.com/p/makeapp-claims-to-remove-makeup-from-photos-its-as-misogynistic-as-it-sounds-5464556/amp
[11/15/17, 1:10:57 PM] Miller: @17189742074
[11/15/17, 1:11:10 PM] Miller: Need go run all your tinder matches through this
[11/15/17, 1:11:29 PM] Launchpad: no thank you Ill just take them where the lighting is dim
[11/15/17, 1:29:19 PM] Dan Watts: yesssss
[11/15/17, 1:29:27 PM] Dan Watts: done with that contour life
[11/15/17, 1:29:35 PM] Dan Watts: and that photoshop life
[11/15/17, 1:30:11 PM] Donk: you need to get that HandsApp, that predicts the tinderella's hand sized based on head shape
[11/15/17, 1:30:50 PM] Dan Watts: lmao
[11/15/17, 1:31:20 PM] Dan Watts: if she can palm a basketball im out
[11/15/17, 3:21:49 PM] Scott: @15166335046 i see you bringing that fire to Joel Herman
[11/15/17, 3:23:06 PM] Launchpad: screenshot
[11/15/17, 3:23:59 PM] Scott: Damn I lost it. I'm sure miller will pull it u
[11/15/17, 3:24:01 PM] Scott: Up
[11/15/17, 3:24:21 PM] Dan Watts: joel herman sit down?
[11/15/17, 3:24:32 PM] Scott: I don't see that he responded.
[11/15/17, 5:22:17 PM] Miller: Lol oh cheese
[11/15/17, 5:22:51 PM] Brian Katz: What was said?
[11/15/17, 5:25:47 PM] Miller: Oh boo
[11/15/17, 5:25:48 PM] Miller: All the hermans posts got deleted
[11/15/17, 5:26:14 PM] Scott: See. Not my fault I couldn't replicate it
[11/15/17, 5:26:25 PM] Miller: But the gist of it was they were arguing with this idiot who has a complete fundamental lack of understanding of the tax reform proposal, he's talking about how it's going to help middle class in NY etc. He did all this math that was totally wrong and he took the 24k standard deduction 2x and then itemized. Herman sent back a funny picture correcting all his mistakes in red ink with a screenshot
[11/15/17, 5:27:27 PM] Miller: I was making a sarcastic comment about how the only reason Joel thinks it's bad is because he's doing the actual math and that if he just followed the stupidity Eric was doing he would like it more
[11/15/17, 5:27:51 PM] Miller: That idiot also forgot to take into account the impact of losing the state (and potentially city) deduction
[11/15/17, 5:28:39 PM] Launchpad: now it just looks like you're saying made up things to a made up person
[11/15/17, 5:31:21 PM] Miller: I've looked dumber
[11/15/17, 5:34:05 PM] Launchpad: whats that like I wouldn't know
[11/15/17, 5:34:23 PM] Brian Katz: Like this
[11/15/17, 5:35:15 PM] Scott: Classic lp
[11/15/17, 5:35:20 PM] Launchpad: Me with Dan Bilzerian?  Bruh thats a classic look
[11/15/17, 5:35:42 PM] Brian Katz: Who‚Äôs that?
[11/15/17, 5:36:16 PM] Scott: Not that guy
[11/15/17, 5:36:30 PM] Scott: That's def not him
[11/15/17, 5:36:31 PM] Brian Katz: He‚Äôs a pro poker player?
[11/15/17, 5:39:58 PM] Launchpad: what are you talkin about that guys not a poker player hes a self taught computer coder
[11/15/17, 5:41:04 PM] Brian Katz: Is there a less famous dan bilzerian that‚Äôs a coder?
[11/15/17, 5:41:19 PM] Launchpad: lol i meant justin herman
[11/15/17, 5:41:25 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[11/15/17, 5:43:09 PM] Miller: 21 year anniversary of the biggest choke job in sports history
[11/15/17, 5:43:28 PM] Brian Katz: Which was what?
[11/15/17, 5:44:14 PM] Brian Katz: Cause the biggest choke job in sports history was 10 months ago mi amigo
[11/15/17, 5:44:20 PM] Miller: The monstars blew a 66-18 halftime lead
[11/15/17, 5:44:44 PM] Brian Katz: I saw that on face book lol
[11/15/17, 6:20:43 PM] Miller: Kluber won the Cy young, maybe next year he will be good enough to start a playoff series
[11/15/17, 6:23:22 PM] Launchpad: And maybe you'll get hired to manage an MLB team
[11/15/17, 6:23:30 PM] Launchpad: You are a rich white guy so you're half way there
[11/15/17, 6:24:03 PM] Miller: Generally those jobs go to ex ball players
[11/15/17, 6:48:03 PM] Dan Watts: Bad meme
[11/15/17, 6:48:06 PM] Dan Watts: Not dank

[11/16/17, 8:20:45 PM] Justin: I've heard poker people discuss how it pretty much is.
[11/16/17, 8:22:23 PM] Justin: Something with how they can follow it to a degree but these coins get sent to like thousands of accounts siphoning off some each time or something to that degree. Idk haven't been scammed. Point is it clearly makes it easier to electronically demand ransom, not exactly an arguable point.
[11/16/17, 8:22:23 PM] Launchpad: Bravo then. Better pay those hackers
[11/16/17, 8:22:48 PM] Justin: Sucks for her boss.

[11/17/17, 3:51:34 PM] Launchpad: but basically financials & industrials and no other markets?
[11/17/17, 3:55:34 PM] Miller: Correct, when we take investors money we have to give them a blueprint of how we're going to invest it. We can't get too long or too short and can't randomly trade Starbucks or something

[11/17/17, 5:22:40 PM] Justin: Idk yet. I'll  find out in couple hours
[11/17/17, 5:23:10 PM] Justin: Doesn't help that our flight doesn't serve food.

If Naspers (OTC: NPSNY) liquidated itself tomorrow, you'd make a 55% return.

Here's how that breaks down...

Naspers owns $162 billion worth of Tencent stock. However, Naspers' stock market value is only around $117 billion. So Naspers is trading at a $45 billion discount to its shares in Tencent.

Said another way, if Naspers sold its Tencent shares tomorrow at market prices, that would be a 39% gain for you ‚Äì overnight.

But as we showed you in August, Naspers is worth much more than its stake in Tencent... JPMorgan Chase values the rest of the company's assets at $18 billion.

So if you add $18 billion to Naspers' Tencent holdings ($162 billion), then Naspers has a liquidation value of $180 billion. Meanwhile, Naspers' stock market value today is still just $117 billion. So if Naspers liquidated tomorrow, you'd make a 55% return ($180 billion versus $117 billion).

[11/22/17, 2:18:39 PM] Miller: and would need to a) go do that b) share the results
[11/22/17, 2:19:05 PM] Miller: so all the morons in your feed are too stupid to a) think they could have been impacted and b) too embarrassed to share the results if they did
[11/22/17, 2:19:36 PM] Justin: Idk im pretty aware I likely shared a bunch
[11/22/17, 2:19:53 PM] Miller: look you might have once shared an article saying the pope endorsed bernie sanders

[11/29/17, 10:56:27 AM] Justin: for anyone who followed thorugh on millers target black friday deal
[11/29/17, 10:57:05 AM] Justin: also 2 - Use Discover card this quarter for 5% cash back. Note that limit of $1500 in purchases at Amazon and Target combined this quarter is the max you will receive 5% CB on.
[11/29/17, 11:00:27 AM] Miller: i dont believe you can use the 20% off target to buy gift cards
[11/29/17, 11:15:14 AM] Kiyoon: you cant
[11/29/17, 11:15:36 AM] Kiyoon: but will probably buy the max on that one
[11/29/17, 11:55:42 AM] Justin: You can with minimal creativity
[11/29/17, 11:56:04 AM] Miller: imagine what you could do with maximal creativity
[11/29/17, 11:56:19 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/29/17, 11:56:29 AM] Justin: Use discover to buy the gift cards. Use gift cards to pay with 20% off
[11/29/17, 11:57:28 AM] Justin: Doubt you need more than 2% brain power for that
[11/29/17, 11:57:54 AM] Miller: no but you do need a discover card which only 2% of people have
[11/29/17, 11:57:57 AM] Justin: But yes you can't just hold it
[11/29/17, 11:58:11 AM] Justin: Well just don't use discover than and still stack?
[11/29/17, 11:58:30 AM] Miller: how
[11/29/17, 11:58:55 AM] Justin: Buy gift cards with any purchase method
[11/29/17, 11:59:10 AM] Justin: Use gift cards with 20% off
[11/29/17, 11:59:45 AM] Justin: I mean you can't convert 20% coupon to gift card balance, if that is what your implying
[11/29/17, 11:59:59 AM] Miller: yea that is what would be interesting
[11/29/17, 12:00:04 PM] Miller: if there was some workaround for that
[11/29/17, 12:00:17 PM] Justin: But if you wanted a large ticket item would still be like 26% off
[11/29/17, 12:00:42 PM] Miller: if i wanted a large ticket item i would want the protection of buying it on a CC vs saving the extra handful of % points
[11/29/17, 12:00:42 PM] Miller: personally
[11/29/17, 12:00:43 PM] Justin: Idk if target price matches things like tv's etc
[11/29/17, 12:01:06 PM] Justin: Fair. Could put some of it on cc?
[11/29/17, 12:01:17 PM] Justin: Not sure if it needs to be full purchase price
[11/29/17, 12:01:23 PM] Miller: yea it would
[11/29/17, 12:02:11 PM] Justin: Also not sure how that protection works on electronics, never used it
[11/29/17, 12:02:48 PM] Miller: varies by CC
[11/29/17, 12:02:55 PM] Miller: generally extends warranty at the very least
[11/29/17, 12:03:47 PM] Justin: Not even sure what the cap is on 20%
[11/29/17, 12:04:27 PM] Miller: i returned a whole bunch of shit to bestbuy (bt bunch of sonos shit on BF then re-bought it cheaper on crutchfield b/c of no tax) and the guy was like how much cheaper did you end up getting it for? implying he was going to negotiate with me which was weird
[11/29/17, 12:04:36 PM] Miller: i told him a few hundred $ and he didnt respond
[11/29/17, 12:04:56 PM] Miller: as if i was going to go through the pain in the ass of doing that whole exchange and wasting 30 min of my life for $10
[11/29/17, 12:06:46 PM] Justin: You buy it online from best buy?
[11/29/17, 12:06:53 PM] Miller: yea
[11/29/17, 12:07:13 PM] Miller: guy was initially like uh idk if we can do this, its a lot of stuff
[11/29/17, 12:07:22 PM] Miller: like okay? thats not how returns work
[11/29/17, 12:07:36 PM] Miller: i didnt see a "too much stuff" clause in their terms
[11/29/17, 12:07:39 PM] Justin: Lol

[11/29/17, 2:04:46 PM] Justin: Although he claims math is real, it's just science that isn't
[11/29/17, 2:04:54 PM] Brian Katz: He‚Äôs going to get about 100 feet in the air, or blow up instantly.
[11/29/17, 2:05:59 PM] Brian Katz: Not that I needed confirmation, but I‚Äôve been out in the open ocean. I can‚Äôt see to Europe.

[11/29/17, 2:16:06 PM] Kiyoon: when is that guy propelling himself btw
[11/29/17, 2:16:15 PM] Kiyoon: there is a video of him doing a different launch a bit back
[11/29/17, 2:17:22 PM] Justin: idk, but the news better not treat it as a tragedy when he dies
[11/29/17, 2:17:38 PM] Justin: have memorials for this idiot and what not
[11/29/17, 2:17:45 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs more of evolution tbh
[11/29/17, 2:17:54 PM] Justin: on board with that
[11/29/17, 2:18:06 PM] Justin: he probably doesn't agree with evolution either though
[11/29/17, 2:18:21 PM] Justin: so both those realities gonna come crashing down on him
[11/29/17, 2:18:45 PM] Brian Katz: You got to have at least one test launch before you try something of this magnitude
[11/29/17, 2:19:30 PM] Justin: so far the evil goernment has saved him form killing himself
[11/29/17, 2:19:48 PM] Justin: thinkgs hes gotta schedule it to make sure he doesnt kill anyone else with the launch

[11/29/17, 3:19:39 PM] Miller: i dont have the balls for that kind of trading
[11/29/17, 3:23:59 PM] Justin: yeh thats a fucken nutty swing
[11/29/17, 3:25:37 PM] Justin: how often do you see multiple 10-20% swings in a day ?
[11/29/17, 3:28:48 PM] Miller: i cant think of any ever in my space
[11/29/17, 3:29:04 PM] Miller: maybe during the crisis but was more just like down and down wasnt really a swing
[11/29/17, 3:33:57 PM] Kiyoon: and theyve had a down of 80% 5 times already
[11/29/17, 3:37:16 PM] Brian Katz: Damn a collectible. What day you scotty?
[11/29/17, 4:10:48 PM] Launchpad: I just gave an hour long blockchain talk to my company
[11/29/17, 4:10:53 PM] Launchpad: Lunch & Learn session

[11/29/17, 4:13:14 PM] Launchpad: buy weed
[11/29/17, 4:16:29 PM] Justin: Fair but not how math works
[11/29/17, 4:17:19 PM] Launchpad: lol how does math work
[11/29/17, 4:17:57 PM] Justin: Well by that standard it dipped 200%
[11/29/17, 4:18:19 PM] Launchpad: by that standard I still have an 80% gain
[11/29/17, 4:18:27 PM] Launchpad: ***800%
[11/29/17, 4:18:29 PM] Justin: True
[11/29/17, 4:18:49 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[11/29/17, 4:28:39 PM] Launchpad: even thought the price of bitcoin is listed as $9,785.89, the true value is over $11,000 if you held on through the forks
[11/29/17, 4:30:28 PM] Brian Katz: According to Mark Cuban, the value is what you put on it.
[11/29/17, 4:32:25 PM] Launchpad: the value is whatever you're willing to pay for it
[11/29/17, 4:32:28 PM] Launchpad: same as dollars
[11/29/17, 4:33:39 PM] Miller: well the difference of course being $s can be used to purchase anything and are widely accepted, so that statement doesnt make total sense
[11/29/17, 4:34:54 PM] Launchpad: if it makes you feel better you can consider bitcoins as stock in the bitcoin network
[11/29/17, 4:35:06 PM] Miller: it does
[11/29/17, 4:35:12 PM] Launchpad: you can't buy a gallon of milk at the store with shares of Apple
[11/29/17, 4:35:15 PM] Miller: i like that more than the currency comparison
[11/29/17, 4:35:54 PM] Miller: you could if the bodega owner was #smart
[11/29/17, 4:36:01 PM] Miller: even just one share
[11/29/17, 4:36:14 PM] Launchpad: and if the bodega owner was smart he would also accept bitcoins
[11/29/17, 4:36:28 PM] Justin: No he wouldn't
[11/29/17, 4:36:40 PM] Miller: well sure i would trade you a gallon of milk for a bitcoin
[11/29/17, 4:36:40 PM] Justin: Kinda like today disproved my point from last night
[11/29/17, 4:36:43 PM] Miller: using that same analogy
[11/29/17, 4:37:08 PM] Justin: People aren't evading capital controls with volatility like today
[11/29/17, 4:37:08 PM] Launchpad: unlike Apple stock, bitcoin is subdivisible
[11/29/17, 4:37:12 PM] Launchpad: moreso than dollars
[11/29/17, 4:37:24 PM] Justin: People aren't accepting it as currency withvolatility like today
[11/29/17, 4:37:35 PM] Launchpad: @15166335046 I literally included a screenshot of this blogpost in my presentation
[11/29/17, 4:37:37 PM] Launchpad: https://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics
[11/29/17, 4:38:35 PM] Launchpad: you know you can accept bitcoin as payment and have it immediately converted to dollars with bitstamp without any volatility risk so that point is actually invalid
[11/29/17, 4:38:36 PM] Justin: If you're into taking risk sure, but most people don't take risk as payment for services.
[11/29/17, 4:39:02 PM] Justin: Didn't know that. Do you ah e to pay for that?
[11/29/17, 4:39:25 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[11/29/17, 4:43:23 PM] Justin: Seems complicated in terms of a business plan for bitstanp.
[11/29/17, 4:43:24 PM] Brian Katz: A lot more meat
[11/29/17, 4:43:46 PM] Dan Watts: should do a kickstarter for this chick to get her a boob job
[11/29/17, 4:43:49 PM] Justin: Not impossible but what happens when there is a sustained massive correction?
[11/29/17, 4:44:12 PM] Justin: Assuming they aren't just holding onto these coins on the upswing.
[11/29/17, 4:45:02 PM] Launchpad: bitstamp?
[11/29/17, 4:45:16 PM] Justin: I suppose that's counterbalanced by quick massive jumps on upside
[11/29/17, 4:45:18 PM] Justin: Yeh
[11/29/17, 4:45:28 PM] Launchpad: the risk of doing business
[11/29/17, 4:45:36 PM] Launchpad: they buy and sell bitcoin, and make money on the spread
[11/29/17, 4:45:48 PM] Launchpad: make the spread wide enough to account for the volatility
[11/29/17, 4:45:57 PM] Launchpad: its the same thing for gold & silver dealers
[11/29/17, 4:46:10 PM] Justin: I mean at swings of 10% in a minute, that's pretty volatile
[11/29/17, 4:46:50 PM] Justin: I mean they exist so like your saying, they must think it's worth it
[11/29/17, 4:47:05 PM] Launchpad: then don't get into that business
[11/29/17, 4:47:30 PM] Miller: implies massive transaction costs for the user or the business
[11/29/17, 4:47:32 PM] Launchpad: you know how much money coinbase must be making right now?
[11/29/17, 4:47:34 PM] Launchpad: probably billions
[11/29/17, 4:47:59 PM] Launchpad: probably true
[11/29/17, 4:48:08 PM] Launchpad: but credit cards are expensive to small businesses too
[11/29/17, 4:49:56 PM] Launchpad: I will say this with absolute certainty: The blockchain is here to stay
[11/29/17, 4:50:16 PM] Launchpad: Does that mean bitcoin will forever be the largest crypto? Not at all
[11/29/17, 4:50:21 PM] Launchpad: something else will take its place

[11/29/17, 10:56:11 PM] Justin: lol thought LP posted this
[11/30/17, 7:53:50 AM] Miller: ill buy it, but if its less than 10k in 2020 you have to reimburse the difference.  I'll even bump the 25% profit share up to 50% b/c i'm a nice guy
[11/30/17, 8:56:19 AM] Kiyoon: I just bought some bitcoin recently Scotty, I'm all in with you to be a billionaire
[11/30/17, 9:49:06 AM] Launchpad: shit no wonder its all down today
[11/30/17, 9:52:01 AM] Kiyoon: coupe of weeks ago, you can thank me for the uptick
[11/30/17, 9:56:07 AM] Launchpad: welcome to the club
[11/30/17, 9:56:18 AM] Launchpad: lot of haters on the outside ignore them
[11/30/17, 9:58:51 AM] Launchpad: you own just bitcoin or any of the alts?
[11/30/17, 9:59:56 AM] Kiyoon: bitcoin and litecoin
[11/30/17, 10:05:36 AM] Launchpad: nice I own some litecoin
[11/30/17, 10:28:35 AM] Launchpad: damn now they talking about bitcoin on Barstool
[11/30/17, 10:28:46 AM] Launchpad: time to sell üò¢
[11/30/17, 10:29:44 AM] Scott: Barstool controls the crypto markets ?
[11/30/17, 10:29:50 AM] Scott: I knew it.
[11/30/17, 10:32:37 AM] Launchpad: Gotta get KY to buy some weed next
[11/30/17, 10:34:13 AM] Miller: sorry kayla, we cant get engaged yet, i put your engagement ring $ into cryptocurrencies
[11/30/17, 10:36:43 AM] Launchpad: smart guy
[11/30/17, 10:37:24 AM] Launchpad: you can buy an appreciating asset or one thats extremely marked up
[11/30/17, 10:37:37 AM] Launchpad: and is worth significantly less than the cost of materials
[11/30/17, 10:37:59 AM] Launchpad: in 3 years (or 3 months) he'll be able to afford her a much nicer ring
[11/30/17, 10:38:28 AM] Donk: yeah, the diamond industry is bullshit
[11/30/17, 10:38:34 AM] Donk: its a racket
[11/30/17, 10:39:32 AM] Kiyoon: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[11/30/17, 10:39:40 AM] Kiyoon: yeah diamond industry sucks
[11/30/17, 10:39:51 AM] Donk: its worse than a car, the second you leave the store with it, it basically loses half of it value
[11/30/17, 10:41:15 AM] Scott: Literally
[11/30/17, 10:41:43 AM] Launchpad: bitcoin is pretty bad too. The moment KY buys it also goes down 20% üòÇüòÇ
[11/30/17, 10:45:49 AM] Scott: Classic ky
[11/30/17, 10:50:42 AM] Kiyoon: I literally told you 10 minutes ago I bought 2 weeks ago
[11/30/17, 10:50:46 AM] Kiyoon: when it went up like 20%
[11/30/17, 10:50:53 AM] Launchpad: im jk
[11/30/17, 10:51:22 AM] Launchpad: we'll both be wearing diamonds to the next draft party
[11/30/17, 10:51:55 AM] Dan Watts: @16313981203 is not permitted to go to anymore draft parties
[11/30/17, 10:52:02 AM] Launchpad: gonna also pick myself up one of these:
[11/30/17, 10:52:07 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/30/17, 10:52:10 AM] Scott: I will take his picks for him.
[11/30/17, 10:53:09 AM] Brian Katz: Didn‚Äôt macgregor wear that before he lost? I don‚Äôt think you want to follow suit! Lol I kill myself sometimes
[11/30/17, 10:55:24 AM] Donk: ha nice, that was good off the cuff...
[11/30/17, 10:55:53 AM] Launchpad: I think it would suit me well tbh
[11/30/17, 10:58:51 AM] Brian Katz: Lol nice
[11/30/17, 10:59:03 AM] Brian Katz: Suit puns are the bees knees
[11/30/17, 12:15:54 PM] Miller: launchpad buying a beer at petco park for $8 
"this is a racket, you are charging me much more than the cost of materials"
[11/30/17, 12:16:34 PM] Miller: iPhone X Costs Apple $370 in Materials: IHS Markit (ihsmarkit.com) 120. Engineers at marketing research firm IHS Markit cracked open the base version iPhone X, which Apple is selling at $999, this week. After preliminary physical dissection, the firm estimated that the iPhone X carries a bill of materials of $370
[11/30/17, 12:16:47 PM] Miller: i dare say apple, you are charging much more for your phones than it costs you
[11/30/17, 12:19:21 PM] Launchpad: big difference between an $8 beer and a 10k useless rock that goes on your finger and makes you poor
[11/30/17, 12:23:34 PM] Miller: big difference b/w complaining about paying above cost of raw materials for something and now implying that buying said thing will put you into financial hardship
[11/30/17, 12:23:56 PM] Miller: dont buy a 1.5m house that is made of 350k in materials if you make 40k
[11/30/17, 12:24:31 PM] Miller: is throwing away 40-100k on a wedding a "smart financial decision"?
[11/30/17, 12:24:59 PM] Launchpad: look i will probably buy a fucken ring someday (far away) but for now I will buy appreciating assets
[11/30/17, 12:25:05 PM] Launchpad: def not
[11/30/17, 12:25:25 PM] Miller: and yet people do it every day
[11/30/17, 12:26:40 PM] Miller: i know the margin on jumbo diet coke at the movie theater is 9 billion %, but im still  going to buy it instead of sneaking a 2 liter in my pants leg b/c who fucking cares
[11/30/17, 12:27:00 PM] Miller: cant just look at financial impacts of every decision, theres a social and mental aspect that is real as well
[11/30/17, 12:27:30 PM] Miller: (i didnt even buy a ring, nicole has my moms) but if it was something important to her and makes her happy and i could afford it then sure why not
[11/30/17, 12:27:56 PM] Miller: not gonna tell her im taking the 10k  and putting it into a 2.5% CD b/c that makes more economic sense
[11/30/17, 12:27:57 PM] Miller: FOH
[11/30/17, 12:28:49 PM] Launchpad: and 2.5% you may as well buy the ring
[11/30/17, 12:29:00 PM] Miller: is 2.5% worse than -50%?
[11/30/17, 12:29:02 PM] Launchpad: **at
[11/30/17, 12:29:17 PM] Launchpad: are those the only options?
[11/30/17, 12:29:26 PM] Miller: well im using your ring variable at -50%
[11/30/17, 12:29:27 PM] Miller: so yes
[11/30/17, 12:29:47 PM] Miller: the better idea is not to look at everything in life as investments
[11/30/17, 12:29:52 PM] Miller: dont buy a ring with the idea of ever reselling it
[11/30/17, 12:29:56 PM] Miller: dont buy a house as an investment
[11/30/17, 12:42:26 PM] Launchpad: maybe the better idea is not to look at every investment as the reason for delaying engagement ü§î
[11/30/17, 12:43:16 PM] Miller: tell that to @16313981203
[11/30/17, 12:44:04 PM] Justin: in fairness, you probably should buy a house with a decent plan in mind
[11/30/17, 12:45:46 PM] Miller: you should buy a house b/c its a place to live
[11/30/17, 12:45:53 PM] Miller: not b/c you are planning on making money on it
[11/30/17, 12:46:09 PM] Miller: unless you are buying it specifically for an investment which is a totally diff ballgame
[11/30/17, 12:46:12 PM] Justin: idk about amking money, but buying a house is an investment decision
[11/30/17, 12:46:37 PM] Justin: otherwise you would just rent...i get it the hastle of moving etc
[11/30/17, 12:46:59 PM] Miller: buying vs renting decision has almost nothing to do w/that
[11/30/17, 12:47:20 PM] Justin: i mean other than being settled down, what non financial benefits are there
[11/30/17, 12:47:23 PM] Miller: but back to my point, lets say you are 50, if you buy a house for 1m and are going to be there for the rest of your life, it doesnt matter if that house is worth 800k or 1.2m
[11/30/17, 12:47:34 PM] Justin: thats fair
[11/30/17, 12:47:57 PM] Justin: you cant really worry about its appreciation/depreciation
[11/30/17, 12:47:58 PM] Miller: its value is that it is a residence not whatever theoretical paper gain you may have
[11/30/17, 12:48:03 PM] Miller: is the way you should look at it
[11/30/17, 12:48:43 PM] Miller: like im almost certainly going to make $ on my house when i sell it, so sure its awesome that i lived there for 7-8 years for "free", but certainly that was not the driving force behind my decision at the time
[11/30/17, 12:49:16 PM] Justin: idk well find out in a couple hours
[11/30/17, 12:49:33 PM] Miller: will we?
[11/30/17, 12:49:37 PM] Miller: let me know
[11/30/17, 12:49:57 PM] Launchpad: on of the main driving forces behind me NOT buying a house is that its too concentrated of an investment
[11/30/17, 12:50:18 PM] Launchpad: I like managing my own money and if I owned a house Id mostly be paying the mortgage and thats it
[11/30/17, 12:50:20 PM] Justin: just rubbing the middle class tax cut in your fac a little more
[11/30/17, 12:50:34 PM] Miller: sure?
[11/30/17, 12:50:39 PM] Miller: i mean its also bad for you
[11/30/17, 12:50:41 PM] Miller: and your gf
[11/30/17, 12:50:42 PM] Miller: and your parents
[11/30/17, 12:50:45 PM] Justin: yeh its bad for everyone
[11/30/17, 12:51:10 PM] Justin: was being cynical
[11/30/17, 12:51:16 PM] Miller: i dont think it will have a material impact on LI housing mkt but i could be wrong
[11/30/17, 12:51:29 PM] Justin: it has to
[11/30/17, 12:51:54 PM] Justin: guess dpeends when your selling and all
[11/30/17, 12:52:03 PM] Miller: i dont think ppl take into account the tax implications or benefits of home ownership generally speaking
[11/30/17, 12:52:23 PM] Miller: go ask the "average" home buyer if they even know that property taxes are deductible currently
[11/30/17, 12:52:41 PM] Miller: and if they end up compromising on a 10k cap its going to mostly curb that issue
[11/30/17, 12:52:50 PM] Justin: thats pretty fateful to market theory
[11/30/17, 12:53:24 PM] Miller: i firmly believe that LI housing mkt is very simply driven by supply and demand, supply being very limited
[11/30/17, 12:53:30 PM] Justin: but long term disastorous as well
[11/30/17, 12:53:31 PM] Miller: only so many places to live if you work in the city
[11/30/17, 12:53:37 PM] Miller: our generation home ownership is rising
[11/30/17, 12:53:42 PM] Justin: you moved/ moving for a very specific reason
[11/30/17, 12:53:47 PM] Miller: and everyone and their mother getting priced out of manhattan and now brooklyn/queens
[11/30/17, 12:54:07 PM] Justin: and this directly will destroy that reason
[11/30/17, 12:54:17 PM] Justin: granted it will take decade plus
[11/30/17, 12:54:35 PM] Miller: not being able to deduct property taxes hardly "destroys" anything
[11/30/17, 12:54:41 PM] Miller: youre very overly dramatic
[11/30/17, 12:54:43 PM] Justin: other side
[11/30/17, 12:55:08 PM] Justin: not mortage deduction, local tax deduction is more what im referring to
[11/30/17, 12:55:23 PM] Miller: if anything makes LI more attractive
[11/30/17, 12:55:32 PM] Miller: b/c it makes the 4% NYC surcharge more punitive
[11/30/17, 12:55:43 PM] Miller: everyone paying the same state tax
[11/30/17, 12:55:59 PM] Justin: wait....same page misread thought you meant mortage deduction
[11/30/17, 12:56:44 PM] Justin: property taxes are gonna stagnate..... funds to public schools gonna stagnate, quality eduaction gonna go down
[11/30/17, 12:57:04 PM] Miller: why would property tax increase or decrease be impacted by this at all
[11/30/17, 12:57:10 PM] Justin: i guess there will still be some neighborhoods with extremely high rates targeting well off fmailies
[11/30/17, 12:57:31 PM] Justin: because its the biggest issue in long island politics?
[11/30/17, 12:57:50 PM] Justin: and thats with people being able to write them off
[11/30/17, 12:58:11 PM] Miller: theyre not going down or going to stop growing to compensate for that
[11/30/17, 12:58:25 PM] Justin: really?
[11/30/17, 12:58:28 PM] Miller: i mean hey that would be great but i dont see it happening
[11/30/17, 12:58:33 PM] Justin: thats funny because my congressman thinks they should go down
[11/30/17, 12:58:39 PM] Justin: hes a democrat
[11/30/17, 12:58:46 PM] Miller: or is that something he says b/c he likes people voting for him?
[11/30/17, 12:58:47 PM] Justin: and thats before this deduction
[11/30/17, 12:59:00 PM] Miller: campaigning on lower taxes is the easiest thing in the entire world
[11/30/17, 12:59:05 PM] Miller: doesnt mean its going to happen
[11/30/17, 12:59:07 PM] Justin: now its effectively 100% more expensive for every dollar it goes up
[11/30/17, 12:59:23 PM] Justin: note already over 10k most areas in long island
[11/30/17, 12:59:29 PM] Miller: and from the county perspective "thats not our problem"
[11/30/17, 12:59:30 PM] Miller: and it isnt
[11/30/17, 12:59:48 PM] Miller: what incentive do they have to "negotiate"
[11/30/17, 1:00:08 PM] Justin: well i mean we pay mos tthe taxes so theres that incentive
[11/30/17, 1:00:21 PM] Justin: i mean most those states are net benefactors of federal funds/taxes
[11/30/17, 1:00:28 PM] Justin: what reason do ble states have to fund that?
[11/30/17, 1:00:35 PM] Miller: now youre talking about something different
[11/30/17, 1:00:59 PM] Miller: federal govt has no decision making power in terms of my property taxes
[11/30/17, 1:01:11 PM] Miller: thats all local govts obviously
[11/30/17, 1:02:24 PM] Justin: i mean its largely a chicken or the egg scenario
[11/30/17, 1:02:54 PM] Justin: do we have high taxes because we are economically productive...or are we economically productive becuase we have larger taxes
[11/30/17, 1:03:30 PM] Justin: consdiering you are moving to a disctrict becuase of public education that it will provide your children, id say it's clearly a little bit of both
[11/30/17, 1:04:33 PM] Justin: so the  incentive the federal government has in giving deductions for state and local expenditures, is an increase in tax revenue from those expenditures
[11/30/17, 1:05:16 PM] Justin: if 80% of property taxes(not sure about this), go to public education, its pretty clear what those expenditures are investing in
[11/30/17, 1:05:48 PM] Justin: but yeh overall the rest of america doesnt have to give a fuck thats fair
[11/30/17, 1:06:14 PM] Miller: and guess what, if the federal govt now no longer makes it deductible then they increase their taxable revenue by whatever that amount it (1.3T over 10yrs)
[11/30/17, 1:06:30 PM] Miller: now you have to explain to me why that decision is going to cause nassau county to now turn around and lower property taxes
[11/30/17, 1:06:45 PM] Justin: becuase they are elected?
[11/30/17, 1:07:10 PM] Miller: so before this tax bill went into effect people wanted higher property taxes?
[11/30/17, 1:07:30 PM] Justin: no they wanted lower
[11/30/17, 1:07:38 PM] Miller: and they elect the local reps
[11/30/17, 1:07:40 PM] Miller: and yet
[11/30/17, 1:07:43 PM] Miller: taxes went up
[11/30/17, 1:07:45 PM] Miller: and up
[11/30/17, 1:07:46 PM] Miller: and up
[11/30/17, 1:08:26 PM] Miller: so what changes the disconnect b/w the residents wanting lower taxes and the county telling them no, go fuck yourself now that there has been an accounting change
[11/30/17, 1:08:59 PM] Justin: its more of an issue than it was 10 years ago....20 years ago
[11/30/17, 1:09:16 PM] Justin: the demand to cap taxes is growing on all sides
[11/30/17, 1:09:40 PM] Justin: and now every 1% increase is no longer .66% icnrease or however the math works out
[11/30/17, 1:10:35 PM] Miller: yes its more painful to peoples bottom line, but my point is the fact remains before this people already wanted lower taxes (and didnt get it), that dynamic is going to continue
[11/30/17, 1:10:42 PM] Miller: maybe the rate of increases slow?
[11/30/17, 1:10:45 PM] Miller: sure its possible
[11/30/17, 1:10:54 PM] Miller: but we're talking about very slight changes
[11/30/17, 1:11:14 PM] Justin: they already started capping it
[11/30/17, 1:11:56 PM] Miller: the increases are capped, not the absolute levels
[11/30/17, 1:12:09 PM] Miller: thats just to give people peace of mind
[11/30/17, 1:13:27 PM] Justin: it clearly puts pressure on state and local governments that want to raise tax revenue, that's a big reason behind the idea
[11/30/17, 1:13:49 PM] Justin: im pretty sure the 1.4 trillion dollar deficit indicates that the point of the plan isnt about revenue neutrality
[11/30/17, 1:14:14 PM] Miller: i have no sympathy for nassau county who already has some of the highest taxes in the country
[11/30/17, 1:14:24 PM] Miller: if they are under pressure its a spending problem not a revenue problem
[11/30/17, 1:14:34 PM] Justin: also has some of the best school districts in the country
[11/30/17, 1:14:40 PM] Justin: wonder how that happened
[11/30/17, 1:15:18 PM] Justin: must just be teachers like long island because on the winters
[11/30/17, 1:17:03 PM] Miller: so to recap, nassau county not going to be able to raise taxes as much as before, lets just say they are flat, so school allocations dont increase, so teachers salaries now not going to increase from 100k, so now teachers going to leave to go take 50k somewhere else?
[11/30/17, 1:17:53 PM] Justin: like i said decade+
[11/30/17, 1:18:12 PM] Justin: its long term vision of what will happen
[11/30/17, 1:20:34 PM] Justin: but what will ahppen is revenue will start decreasing, discricts will start buying into privatization schemes and charter schools promising lower costs, will put downward pressure on wages at remaining public schools, more disctricts will adopt charter more downward pressure.....end game shitty segregated private/charter school system
[11/30/17, 1:21:57 PM] Justin: it will be pushed by both parties, Arne Duncan and Obama's entire edcuation plan  was federal funding requirements that states and local governments pursue privatization
[11/30/17, 1:23:00 PM] Justin: and like you imply, if people buy houses without even understanding deduction benefits, no fucken way they realize the connection between local taxes and school systems
[11/30/17, 1:24:14 PM] Miller: thats the one thing probably everyone understands, the only reason ppl here put up w/the taxes is bc you look at as alternative to private school costs
[11/30/17, 1:24:24 PM] Miller: but beyond that "[1:20 PM, 11/30/2017] Herman: but what will ahppen is revenue will start decreasing"
[11/30/17, 1:24:25 PM] Miller: not happening
[11/30/17, 1:24:37 PM] Justin: ok well see
[11/30/17, 1:24:44 PM] Miller: we will
[11/30/17, 1:25:54 PM] Justin: i mean it's fucken identical to the crisis alot of localities are having after the housing bubble
[11/30/17, 1:26:31 PM] Justin: everyone got elected on lowering taxes, which they were able to do by investing state and local funds into the market at returns of 9% plus
[11/30/17, 1:27:10 PM] Justin: than market crashed, and its not like after the market crashed these localities could now raise taxes
[11/30/17, 1:27:39 PM] Justin: so you have cities like michigan, broke
[11/30/17, 1:28:20 PM] Justin: privatization offers solution, so now you have cities like michigan with schools not meeting minimal standards, and water supply poisened...but noone gives a fuck
[11/30/17, 1:29:09 PM] Justin: states* lol
[11/30/17, 1:31:09 PM] Justin: there is the other example of california which increased taxes and turned shit around, but that's not the likely route

[11/30/17, 4:10:04 PM] Justin: The 86,237 comments submitted at precisely 7:18:04 p.m. on May 24 offer an example of this approach. No two were exactly the same, but all featured consistent patterns. Most began with variations of a similar theme, such as: ‚ÄúDear [FCC Chairman] Mr. Pai, I am a voter worried about regulations on the Internet,‚Äù ‚ÄúDear Chairman Pai, I am a voter worried about Title 2 and net neutrality,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDear Commissioners: I‚Äôm concerned about Internet regulation and net neutrality.‚Äù

The body of these comments also featured similar phrases. One post charged, ‚ÄúObama‚Äôs policy to take over the web is a betrayal of net neutrality. It reversed a free-market policy that functioned supremely well for decades with both parties‚Äô backing.‚Äù While another stated, ‚ÄúThe previous administration‚Äôs policy to control the Internet is a betrayal of the open Internet. It disrupted a free-market system that functioned fabulously smoothly for decades with bipartisan approval.

[11/30/17, 6:05:56 PM] Kiyoon: Apparently but I did not feel anything
[11/30/17, 6:06:07 PM] Kiyoon: I'm driving though not sure if that makes a difference
[11/30/17, 6:06:56 PM] Launchpad: lol dumass
[11/30/17, 7:32:20 PM] Scott: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/30/17, 8:03:01 PM] Miller: Cheese why you look so fat
[11/30/17, 8:04:55 PM] Scott: Leaning backwards lol
[11/30/17, 8:05:28 PM] Miller: Mental note try leaning forward next time lol
[11/30/17, 8:05:36 PM] Scott: Lol.
[11/30/17, 8:05:40 PM] Scott: Fair
[11/30/17, 8:06:09 PM] Miller: Lawyers night out?
[11/30/17, 8:06:31 PM] Scott: Holiday party watts informed me about
[11/30/17, 8:07:02 PM] Scott: It's lit.
[11/30/17, 8:07:12 PM] Scott: We lost him.
[11/30/17, 8:07:19 PM] Scott: Too lit for the kid.
[11/30/17, 8:08:13 PM] Miller: Guess like the katz party my invite got lost in the mail
[11/30/17, 8:12:35 PM] Launchpad: Try not eating carbs for like 3 months, that will also help
[11/30/17, 8:18:37 PM] Miller: Some 22 year old girl at work told me I have an old soul
[11/30/17, 8:18:46 PM] Miller: I was pretty insulted tbh
[11/30/17, 8:19:49 PM] Miller: Cmon I have a beer pong table in my house and I'm going to see both nights of Taylor Swift tour next summer
[11/30/17, 8:26:27 PM] Launchpad: clearly your soul is still pre-pubescent
[11/30/17, 8:29:31 PM] Miller: I'll take it üòÇ
[11/30/17, 8:34:19 PM] Scott: Haha
[11/30/17, 9:27:56 PM] Brian Katz: Have you told her about your love of Taylor Swift?
[11/30/17, 9:33:03 PM] Miller: I did
[12/1/17, 11:09:13 AM] Miller: *FLYNN PREPARED TO TESTIFY AGAINST TRUMP, ABC REPORTS
[12/1/17, 11:09:14 AM] Miller: its lit
[12/1/17, 11:09:51 AM] Justin: Lol
[12/1/17, 11:09:59 AM] Justin: So much for stoping this tax bill
[12/1/17, 11:10:12 AM] Miller: seems unlikely
[12/1/17, 11:10:15 AM] Miller: collins still holding out
[12/1/17, 11:10:17 AM] Miller: shes last hope
[12/1/17, 11:10:26 AM] Miller: although this conference next week could get ugly also
[12/1/17, 11:10:48 AM] Miller: idk where they find another 350B to pay for the 10k SALT deduction the house is theoretically demanding
[12/1/17, 11:11:14 AM] Miller: also no idea how theyre paying for the original 350B yet, does trumps pride piss on a 25% corp TR and not sign it? i doubt it but cant be ruled out
[12/1/17, 11:11:51 AM] Justin: They came up to 25?
[12/1/17, 11:12:05 AM] Justin: I Don't know what's in it as is
[12/1/17, 11:12:38 AM] Justin: And yeh I noticed that yesterday. Senate bill doesn't have 10k deduction, thought was just a typo
[12/1/17, 11:12:58 AM] Justin: Does that imply senate bill really like 1.7 trillion?
[12/1/17, 11:16:06 AM] Miller: no senate bill is 1.5 still
[12/1/17, 11:16:13 AM] Miller: but if they added in the house 10k cap would be 1.8T
[12/1/17, 11:16:43 AM] Miller: and no corp TR still 20% as far as anyone knows but the point is they had to find 350B this morning to appease a few of these guys they have swung which they did, but we just dont know how they did that yet
[12/1/17, 11:16:49 AM] Miller: will find out in the near future
[12/1/17, 11:16:54 AM] Miller: the easiest way is just to raise the corp TR from 20
[12/1/17, 11:17:00 AM] Miller: but trump has been stickler on 20
[12/1/17, 11:17:31 AM] Justin: Probably cut Medicare
[12/1/17, 11:18:02 AM] Miller: doubt it
[12/1/17, 11:18:05 AM] Miller: theyre trying to woo collins
[12/1/17, 11:18:58 AM] Justin: Yeh that's 8 years from now 2 trillion more in debt facing systemic crisis becuase bitcoin is the Reserve currency
[12/1/17, 11:19:06 AM] Justin: I believe 2/3 of that statement
[12/1/17, 11:20:25 AM] Launchpad: bitcoin is not a dick so keep it out of your mouth
[12/1/17, 11:22:07 AM] Donk: Our Paychex rep just came by and dropped off the 2018 tax guides, and was basically like, these are likely to be outdated within the week
[12/1/17, 11:22:29 AM] Justin: Ok, but Im not gonna be sucking dick on the street when bitcoin crashes
[12/1/17, 11:22:43 AM] Launchpad: lol
[12/1/17, 11:23:16 AM] Launchpad: Did you know that in the history of bitcoin there has never been a bad time to buy?
[12/1/17, 11:25:35 AM] Launchpad: besides, you may as well start getting used to digital currencies anyway, they're not going anywhere
[12/1/17, 11:25:57 AM] Launchpad: the worlds reserve currency will one day be digital.  It wont be bitcoin but it will be on the blockchain
[12/1/17, 11:25:57 AM] Justin: How Long does it take to process a bitcoin transaction?
[12/1/17, 11:26:17 AM] Launchpad: quicker than a credit card transaction
[12/1/17, 11:26:18 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/1/17, 11:26:51 AM] Justin: How log is that?
[12/1/17, 11:27:06 AM] Launchpad: lol I was going to add except for a few hours on Wednesday but that will soon go away too
[12/1/17, 11:27:11 AM] Justin: Long*.....Instant ?
[12/1/17, 11:28:18 AM] Launchpad: the transaction itself only takes seconds to show up in the blockchain, it takes about an hour for it to be confirmed enough times as to not be considered counterfeit
[12/1/17, 11:29:03 AM] Justin: Oh ok. That seems like a great currency
[12/1/17, 11:29:09 AM] Launchpad: now if you're selling a cup of coffee with bitcoin, you don't need to worry about waiting an hour as long as you see the transaction you're willing to risk the $5 that you're not getting scammed
[12/1/17, 11:29:13 AM] Justin: I'll take a sandwich and a Coke. I'll be back in an hour
[12/1/17, 11:29:37 AM] Launchpad: Credit card transactions take days to finalize you mongoloid
[12/1/17, 11:29:50 AM] Miller: lol
[12/1/17, 11:29:57 AM] Miller: mongoloid underused insult
[12/1/17, 11:30:00 AM] Miller: i like it
[12/1/17, 11:32:03 AM] Miller: also speak of the devil
[12/1/17, 11:32:03 AM] Miller: *STATE-LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION ADDED TO SENATE BILL: PERSON FAMILIAR
[12/1/17, 11:32:22 AM] Donk: woo!
[12/1/17, 11:32:37 AM] Miller: probably only 10k cap like house but it will help
[12/1/17, 11:32:52 AM] Launchpad: Besides, you pointing to bitcoins weaknesses is irrelevant to the fate of digital currencies. There are already coins with instant transactions that can handle similar loads to Visa
[12/1/17, 11:33:24 AM] Launchpad: you talking about bitcoins speed is like claiming that text messaging will never catch on because phones don't have keyboards
[12/1/17, 11:35:52 AM] Justin: Math if 2+2=4 does that imply 4+4=4
[12/1/17, 11:36:38 AM] Launchpad: Math: there are thousands of developers working on this technology and billions of investment dollars pouring in. Its not going anywhere
[12/1/17, 11:37:04 AM] Justin: Perhaps those smaller coins will become currency, what does that do for bitcoin?
[12/1/17, 11:37:20 AM] Launchpad: again...you keep bringing it back to bitcoin your straw man
[12/1/17, 11:37:39 AM] Launchpad: maybe it will be the biggest of them all or maybe it will go extinct like myspace
[12/1/17, 11:37:53 AM] Launchpad: irrelevant towards the future of the tech.  The tech is here to stay
[12/1/17, 11:37:57 AM] Justin: Bitcoins value is in its market cap now. Ts the reserve of all these new currency and ipo coin openings. . But a lot of money driving the rise lately is from the Kiyoon of the world.
[12/1/17, 11:38:39 AM] Justin: What happens with that beard mentality that is simply buying to sell higher when govt regulation or a technological faltering in one of the wallets occurs?
[12/1/17, 11:39:17 AM] Justin: Hurd mentality*
[12/1/17, 11:39:39 AM] Launchpad: beard mentality üòÇ
[12/1/17, 11:39:50 AM] Donk: Herd?
[12/1/17, 11:39:55 AM] Justin: Beard mentality definitely driving the bubble.
[12/1/17, 11:39:57 AM] Justin: Lol.
[12/1/17, 11:40:02 AM] Justin: Whatever
[12/1/17, 11:40:13 AM] Justin: 0-2. Has t stopped me before
[12/1/17, 11:40:44 AM] Launchpad: what makes you think that this hasn't been already happening throughout the last 7 years?
[12/1/17, 11:41:02 AM] Justin: Kiyoon when did you buy?
[12/1/17, 11:41:13 AM] Justin: Kiyoon why did you buy?
[12/1/17, 11:41:41 AM] Launchpad: Kiyoon buying is definitely a contrarian signal (no offense)
[12/1/17, 11:42:05 AM] Justin: I can see the coin openings capita gains avoidance helping drive price up.
[12/1/17, 11:42:15 AM] Launchpad: yet the CFTC is ready to start allowing bitcoin futures trading, which means billions or trillions of investing dollars will soon have access
[12/1/17, 11:42:20 AM] Justin: That's also a perpetuating cycle
[12/1/17, 11:43:02 AM] Justin: Which may drive it up to 20k.  But if some of these new blockchain ipo start busting, bitcoin will crash
[12/1/17, 11:43:40 AM] Launchpad: pretty good day for alt coins if you ask me https://coinmarketcap.com/
[12/1/17, 11:43:49 AM] Justin: Plenty of technical reasons to be bearish, or just ignore all this
[12/1/17, 11:44:13 AM] Launchpad: you're entire life philosophy is Bearish
[12/1/17, 11:44:21 AM] Justin: I've said enough...my boy will say the rest
[12/1/17, 11:44:33 AM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/1/17, 11:45:02 AM] Launchpad: Its funny cause the people who are the most bearish about crypto are typically the ones who know the least about it
[12/1/17, 11:45:22 AM] Miller: that goes both ways
[12/1/17, 11:45:40 AM] Justin: I get why it's funny because you haven't given me a technical reason to be Long on it
[12/1/17, 11:46:02 AM] Launchpad: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[12/1/17, 11:46:12 AM] Miller: plenty of people who are bullish on it who know very little about it
[12/1/17, 11:46:26 AM] Miller: and plenty of smart people are bullish and bearish on it
[12/1/17, 11:46:28 AM] Launchpad: also true, but those are mostly recent speculators
[12/1/17, 11:46:42 AM] Justin: Lol
[12/1/17, 11:46:46 AM] Launchpad: if you're an OG theres a reason you've stuck around
[12/1/17, 11:47:02 AM] Justin: ?
[12/1/17, 11:47:57 AM] Justin: Agree with this btw
[12/1/17, 11:48:40 AM] Justin: Which is why one should be bearish.
[12/1/17, 11:48:48 AM] Miller: OG? what about a RN
[12/1/17, 11:49:02 AM] Launchpad: why?
[12/1/17, 11:49:22 AM] Justin: Becuase a lot of new investment is speculative, it's simply buying to sell
[12/1/17, 11:49:37 AM] Justin: Classic definition of a bubble
[12/1/17, 11:49:49 AM] Launchpad: what the fuck do you know about bubbles
[12/1/17, 11:49:58 AM] Launchpad: do you have any skin in the game or are you just a spectator?
[12/1/17, 11:50:08 AM] Justin: Perhaps it goes to 30k and futures market gets American banks involved, that's gonna be a fun bailout
[12/1/17, 11:50:29 AM] Launchpad: maybe Ill invite you to my retirement party
[12/1/17, 11:50:53 AM] Justin: I mean you been in since 30$. Its worth 10k. I'd hope retirement is nearing
[12/1/17, 11:50:56 AM] Launchpad: look, crossing the street is dangerous too. I wouldn't recommend closing the street with your eyes closed
[12/1/17, 11:51:13 AM] Launchpad: and more then Id recommend putting your life savings in crypto, thats goddamn foolish
[12/1/17, 11:51:52 AM] Launchpad: but if you want to put down 1%, 5% for the opportunity for asymmetric gains to the risk you'll be taking
[12/1/17, 11:52:21 AM] Launchpad: Heres the technical reason to own crypto - every industry is getting a blockchain
[12/1/17, 11:52:35 AM] Launchpad: the blockchain is going to be a fundamental structure of the internet
[12/1/17, 11:53:57 AM] Launchpad: btw I love investing in bubbles
[12/1/17, 11:54:08 AM] Launchpad: you can make a shit load of money
[12/1/17, 11:59:15 AM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/1/17, 12:00:01 PM] Launchpad: is that the pic you post when you're losing an argument and have nothing to respond?
[12/1/17, 12:08:58 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/1/17, 12:09:26 PM] Miller: pretty sure that was actually said by famous Amos
[12/1/17, 12:09:36 PM] Miller: sad story that guy made no $ off his cookies
[12/1/17, 12:10:05 PM] Justin: Not so famous Amos

[12/1/17, 1:22:37 PM] Launchpad: wtf did I just watch?
[12/1/17, 4:39:23 PM] Launchpad: I'm sure this makes @16316620763 happy

[12/1/17, 4:44:51 PM] Justin: @justin Already knew that. That happened wed possibly related to the drop in price
[12/1/17, 4:45:11 PM] Justin: But at justin doesn't read anything about bitcoin because at justin is a vegetarian
[12/1/17, 4:45:50 PM] Miller: its spelled veterinarian
[12/1/17, 4:46:50 PM] Justin: They claimed victory as the govt request was much larger and encompassing
[12/1/17, 4:55:17 PM] Launchpad: LMAO
[12/1/17, 4:56:38 PM] Launchpad: Yes Im not surprised you heard about this because it is "bearish" news (although really not a surprise to anyone with half a brain)
[12/1/17, 4:57:30 PM] Launchpad: So yes, you will read about all the negative shit about bitcoin but you'll never figure out why it works or why $300 billion is invested
[12/1/17, 4:57:45 PM] Launchpad: because you love your disaster porn
[12/1/17, 4:58:05 PM] Launchpad: Can't imagine what you would ever do if there was real world peace
[12/1/17, 4:58:09 PM] Launchpad: you'd have nothing to complain about
[12/1/17, 4:59:58 PM] Dan Watts: can i be honest?
[12/1/17, 5:00:05 PM] Dan Watts: i'm over the bitcoin convo
[12/1/17, 5:00:19 PM] Launchpad: I'm truly astounded that with your desire for social justice and your anti bank/anti big corporate position, you are extremely negative towards this world changing technology
[12/1/17, 5:00:20 PM] Launchpad: to me?
[12/1/17, 5:01:39 PM] Launchpad: I think most people in this chat are
[12/1/17, 5:02:38 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm all for it scotty. Prove em wrong
[12/1/17, 5:02:59 PM] Brian Katz: Doubt it was haters cast because they‚Äôre too scared to take the risk themselves
[12/1/17, 5:04:12 PM] Dan Watts: oh damn @16318489683 coming with the heat

[12/1/17, 5:22:54 PM] Launchpad: I think your desire to be correct about the impending doom of the planet is stronger than your desire for social change
[12/1/17, 5:23:30 PM] Justin: Brah stop presuming what I think
[12/1/17, 5:23:35 PM] Launchpad: Its like you're waiting for that moment to say "I told you so"
[12/1/17, 5:23:40 PM] Justin: You just a pessimist about my future outlook
[12/1/17, 5:23:45 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/1/17, 5:23:55 PM] Launchpad: cause everything you say is exceptionally negative
[12/1/17, 5:24:09 PM] Justin: So stop telling me my future
[12/1/17, 5:24:20 PM] Justin: Putting me in a box based on past actions
[12/1/17, 5:24:25 PM] Justin: That's ludicrous logic
[12/1/17, 5:24:38 PM] Justin: Life isn't black and white
[12/1/17, 5:24:49 PM] Justin: Stop trying to define everything

[12/1/17, 10:04:08 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs a movie written about Americans from a Eastern Europeans perspective

[12/2/17, 2:42:44 PM] Scott: He's nice
[12/2/17, 7:27:20 PM] Kiyoon: @16316620763 you should watch Trump Jr do his PR deadlift
[12/2/17, 7:36:17 PM] Tk: De Gea is a beast. That's why Real Madrid wants him bad every off-season
[12/2/17, 7:41:51 PM] Justin: Good call lol
[12/2/17, 7:42:33 PM] Justin: Guys pump fistin after deadlifting what most amateur female body builders can deadlift at 40 lbs less than him.
[12/2/17, 7:48:22 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/2/17, 11:22:09 PM] Miller: Also his form is terrible
[12/2/17, 11:45:14 PM] Kiyoon: That was the Point
[12/3/17, 12:07:39 PM] Scott: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/3/17, 12:12:34 PM] Miller: I would choose you for (the opposing) team
[12/3/17, 12:13:47 PM] Scott: Right, cause you would want us to win.
[12/3/17, 12:13:58 PM] Scott: Me and my teammate
[12/3/17, 12:14:11 PM] Miller: I'll write it off as a charitable donation
[12/3/17, 12:14:38 PM] Scott: Yea that's what they call it, losing is charity
[12/3/17, 12:32:55 PM] Kiyoon: Back in the day I'd have picked feinberg
[12/3/17, 12:33:38 PM] Miller: Damn shots fired
[12/3/17, 12:36:49 PM] Scott: Back in the day I would have picked tk
[12/3/17, 6:14:46 PM] Miller: Notani for the Yankees
[12/3/17, 6:16:01 PM] Scott: Where do.u see that
[12/3/17, 6:17:26 PM] Miller: He texted me
[12/3/17, 7:53:55 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[12/4/17, 9:43:46 AM] Miller: http://taxplancalculator.com/
[12/4/17, 9:43:59 AM] Miller: this is the only one who is actually doing the leg work w/the state and local etc...
[12/4/17, 9:47:23 AM] Kiyoon: allegedly I will be getting 2K back in taxes
[12/4/17, 9:48:08 AM] Miller: congratulations on all your wealth
[12/4/17, 9:48:19 AM] Miller: put that 2k into bitcoin now
[12/4/17, 9:52:42 AM] Kiyoon: hell yeah
[12/4/17, 9:52:48 AM] Kiyoon: turn into 200 million
[12/4/17, 10:03:57 AM] Kiyoon: #fakenews?
[12/4/17, 10:04:16 AM] Miller: Did he sign w/them?
[12/4/17, 10:04:19 AM] Kiyoon: lolz, notani
[12/4/17, 10:04:29 AM] Kiyoon: I just got it, damn this is a rough start to monday
[12/4/17, 10:04:40 AM] Miller: hey at least you maybe saved 2k at some point
[12/4/17, 10:07:11 AM] Launchpad: Lets get rich and send these fucken losers some postcards from the St. Thomas
[12/4/17, 10:18:51 AM] Justin: https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/amp/
[12/4/17, 10:20:24 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs stupid. Theres stray cat I‚Äôm my yard that‚Äôs about to have kittens. These things are free.
[12/4/17, 11:13:27 AM] Launchpad: welcome to the future
[12/4/17, 11:14:27 AM] Launchpad: gotta love it how they say "So now we have people using Ether, an asset with arguably little tangible utility" while explaining what people are doing with it
[12/4/17, 11:14:42 AM] Launchpad: next week its going to be "Germs aren't real because I can't see them"
[12/4/17, 11:38:52 AM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/4/17, 11:40:08 AM] Launchpad: ^^ thats how I feel whenever I read an article that states that crypto has no tangible value or its 'backed by nothing'
[12/4/17, 11:40:53 AM] Launchpad: bitcoin is actually backed by the worlds largest distributed computer network
[12/4/17, 11:42:13 AM] Justin: "tangible"
[12/4/17, 11:45:49 AM] Justin: https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16732952/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-billionaires-surge
[12/4/17, 11:46:07 AM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/4/17, 11:46:44 AM] Launchpad: not suprising
[12/4/17, 11:47:18 AM] Launchpad: we will probably soon see Vitalik Buterin crowned the worlds youngest billionaire
[12/4/17, 11:48:09 AM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/4/17, 12:59:48 PM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/4/17, 1:00:03 PM] Scott: Lol
[12/4/17, 1:23:55 PM] Kiyoon: lolzzz
[12/4/17, 3:12:46 PM] Launchpad: you guys should get in on this bubble
[12/4/17, 3:13:31 PM] Launchpad: N****s all about betting on sports
[12/4/17, 3:14:00 PM] Justin: honest question, isnt abot a back and forth, is it a bubble? if not what price do you think it should stabalize at?
[12/4/17, 3:14:40 PM] Scott: Asking for a friend.
[12/4/17, 3:15:05 PM] Launchpad: "isnt abot a back and forth, is it a bubble?"  what does that mean
[12/4/17, 3:15:30 PM] Justin: this isn't going to be a back and forth..... answer these 2 questions
[12/4/17, 3:16:35 PM] Justin: anotehrwords I want you to articulate your position and your forecast, i don't intend to argue it in anyway.
[12/4/17, 3:17:01 PM] Scott: "Intend" - so.it may happen.
[12/4/17, 3:17:12 PM] Launchpad: heres the thing though -- there is no right answer -- no one knows
[12/4/17, 3:17:15 PM] Justin: lol fine stronger words, i wont say anything back
[12/4/17, 3:17:27 PM] Justin: didnt ask anyone, asked you
[12/4/17, 3:17:46 PM] Justin: clearly the future is not a certainty
[12/4/17, 3:19:03 PM] Justin: unless your position is that its 50/50 that its a bubble
[12/4/17, 3:30:29 PM] Launchpad: if the market decides that Bitcoin is a store of value and a currency on par with gold, the global gold market is 2.4 trillion dollars.  thats about 12x the size of bitcoin
[12/4/17, 3:36:19 PM] Launchpad: total crypto market cap is at 343 billion -- long term its a no brainer to continue to gain in value
[12/4/17, 3:36:36 PM] Launchpad: however that doesn't help if it crashes 80% and stays quiet for 3 more years
[12/4/17, 3:36:59 PM] Launchpad: ^^^ Which has happened multiple times
[12/4/17, 4:24:20 PM] Miller: btw random tip if anyone ever "needs" to spend some $ on a CC to hit a bonus (ie within 90 days or w/e) my issue has always been i dont want to use it to buy anything big like a TV or w/e bc i might have the card cancelled at some pt and wouldnt be able to take advantage of warranty type benefits in the future etc...but long story short i figured out an easy way to rack up some $ i just paid $885 into my cable bill (they limit to 6x your monthly balance) but decently easy way to hit the 1k
[12/4/17, 4:26:56 PM] Donk: that reminds me i need to call fucking cablevision, assholes upped my bill like 40.00 this past month for no reason that i can determine
[12/4/17, 4:27:58 PM] Launchpad: the cunts at AT&T downgraded my internet a few months ago from Elite to Basic & tried to tell me that it was just a name change
[12/4/17, 4:28:32 PM] Miller: fios unpromptedly offfered me to renew my contract and doubled my discount
[12/4/17, 4:28:33 PM] Miller: pretty solid
[12/4/17, 4:28:37 PM] Kiyoon: you can buy $$$ of bitcoin on your credit card too
[12/4/17, 4:28:37 PM] Kiyoon: hit that limit
[12/4/17, 4:28:41 PM] Kiyoon: MAKEMAD MONEY
[12/4/17, 4:28:51 PM] Donk: i want to cut the cord, but i just cant bring myself to commit to it
[12/4/17, 4:28:53 PM] Kiyoon: It's like losing money not doing it guys
[12/4/17, 4:29:03 PM] Kiyoon: F cable, get on directv now man
[12/4/17, 4:29:08 PM] Kiyoon: I pay $10 a month for cable
[12/4/17, 4:29:31 PM] Launchpad: Prime, Netflix, HBO, SlingTV
[12/4/17, 4:29:37 PM] Launchpad: what else do you need?
[12/4/17, 4:29:40 PM] Justin: joia has claimed she would cut my balls off if she cant get her real housewives on demand
[12/4/17, 4:29:49 PM] Donk: herman nailed it
[12/4/17, 4:29:52 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/4/17, 4:29:53 PM] Donk: bravo is a major concern
[12/4/17, 4:29:56 PM] Justin: much scarier cut
[12/4/17, 4:29:58 PM] Launchpad: Cody box?
[12/4/17, 4:30:13 PM] Kiyoon: same
[12/4/17, 4:30:17 PM] Kiyoon: bravo is on this $10 package
[12/4/17, 4:30:27 PM] Justin: yeh i know sling has it and i tried pushing that
[12/4/17, 4:30:32 PM] Kiyoon: do any of you have At&T unlimited on yuor phone plan?  If you do you get $25 off a month in directv
[12/4/17, 4:30:34 PM] Justin: i got some nasty looks
[12/4/17, 4:30:42 PM] Kiyoon: its so much cheaper
[12/4/17, 4:30:48 PM] Justin: about how internet connection spotty the stream sucks etc
[12/4/17, 4:30:49 PM] Donk: i have sprint, so that doesnt work
[12/4/17, 4:31:04 PM] Kiyoon: Donk what kind of cable package do you have
[12/4/17, 4:31:27 PM] Donk: pretty much basic cable/internet/phone with the red zone upgrade
[12/4/17, 4:31:37 PM] Kiyoon: it's a concern if your internet connection isn't that grea
[12/4/17, 4:31:49 PM] Kiyoon: I have 50 mbps and it's been fine
[12/4/17, 4:31:57 PM] Kiyoon: what do you pay donk
[12/4/17, 4:32:10 PM] Donk: well it was 130, then went up to 140 with the redzone
[12/4/17, 4:32:11 PM] Justin: well i dont know what i would have post cutting comcast, currently have like 500 or soemthing
[12/4/17, 4:32:16 PM] Donk: but for some reason is now 180?
[12/4/17, 4:32:25 PM] Donk: and its not like i just had a pormotion expire, ive had it for over 2 years
[12/4/17, 4:32:26 PM] Justin: yeh mine like 160 for one box
[12/4/17, 4:32:30 PM] Kiyoon: Herm thats a lot
[12/4/17, 4:32:34 PM] Kiyoon: 500 mbps?
[12/4/17, 4:32:36 PM] Donk: and thats 3 boxes
[12/4/17, 4:32:36 PM] Justin: but we do have almost all channels and redzone and superfast internets
[12/4/17, 4:32:46 PM] Justin: yeh maybe its 250 or 300 idk its fuckan alot
[12/4/17, 4:33:00 PM] Kiyoon: I think I've seen highest is 250
[12/4/17, 4:33:03 PM] Kiyoon: but thats fast
[12/4/17, 4:33:20 PM] Kiyoon: For Donk I'd suggest sling...it's $25 a month for 5 devices
[12/4/17, 4:33:26 PM] Kiyoon: just get a faster internet to not have streaming issues
[12/4/17, 4:33:42 PM] Justin: speed test claims 238
[12/4/17, 4:33:43 PM] Donk: my internet is fine right now, i still stream stuff all of the time with no issue
[12/4/17, 4:33:59 PM] Justin: they have higher they just been bumping it higher and higher lately
[12/4/17, 4:34:03 PM] Kiyoon: PS VUE is expensive and DirectvNow is probably somewhere int he middle without the AT&T Unlimited deal
[12/4/17, 4:34:31 PM] Kiyoon: Donk if you got the highest SLING TV, you'd pay $25, then internet would be what, another $60 or so
[12/4/17, 4:34:34 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/4/17, 4:34:45 PM] Kiyoon: damn thats impressive I want that
[12/4/17, 4:34:48 PM] Launchpad: crazy fast
[12/4/17, 4:35:01 PM] Donk: personally, id be fine if they brought be back to the 130/140 range i was at
[12/4/17, 4:35:09 PM] Justin: yeh if only my illegal downloads were ever complete files
[12/4/17, 4:35:13 PM] Donk: while im sur eit smore than i would be paying, im not upset with the service
[12/4/17, 4:35:20 PM] Donk: im just annoyed with the pricing scams
[12/4/17, 4:35:45 PM] Justin: where the fuck is the blockchain nzb site at LP?
[12/4/17, 4:35:45 PM] Kiyoon: But if you could pay $85 vs $140 why wouldn't you save
[12/4/17, 4:35:48 PM] Launchpad: wait til you get throttled when net neutrality is no longer a thing
[12/4/17, 4:36:01 PM] Launchpad: its coming
[12/4/17, 4:36:07 PM] Justin: like gain instant access to every single movie file
[12/4/17, 4:36:10 PM] Launchpad: give it time, the future wasn't built in a night
[12/4/17, 4:36:16 PM] Justin: id be down to apy 10$ month for that
[12/4/17, 4:36:57 PM] Donk: convenience/happy wife
[12/4/17, 4:37:08 PM] Justin: except what happens when warner brothers puts a digital trace on their movie, its discovered on the blockchain, and they sue the fuck out of the company
[12/4/17, 4:37:23 PM] Donk: for example, in this future where i get sling box, anytime it doesnt work, its going to be my fault
[12/4/17, 4:37:33 PM] Kiyoon: hahaha
[12/4/17, 4:37:35 PM] Donk: vs now if the tv isnt working, i just blame cablevision
[12/4/17, 4:37:50 PM] Kiyoon: someone needs to get Liz on board
[12/4/17, 4:37:54 PM] Justin: fucken comcast charged me 50$ to come her and fix my internet the other day
[12/4/17, 4:37:54 PM] Kiyoon: I'll tell her at the wedding
[12/4/17, 4:38:03 PM] Launchpad: who are they going to sue?
[12/4/17, 4:38:06 PM] Justin: thats ballsy
[12/4/17, 4:38:36 PM] Donk: yeah thats ridiculous
[12/4/17, 4:39:08 PM] Launchpad: show her all your bitcoins and tell her she could have had that instead
[12/4/17, 4:39:46 PM] Kiyoon: Fine I'll tell Kayla to tell Liz how amazing Bravo is on Sling
[12/4/17, 4:41:04 PM] Donk: haha, that would work
[12/4/17, 4:41:39 PM] Donk: though, i dont know if you want to mention this kayla or not, but bravo also has like the entire housewives back catelog on hulu
[12/4/17, 4:41:47 PM] Donk: and im sure all of those other shows as well
[12/4/17, 4:42:38 PM] Kiyoon: oh she knows
[12/4/17, 4:49:36 PM] Miller: fios offers like 1gb interenet for not unreasonable prices
[12/4/17, 4:49:43 PM] Miller: im at 75/75, good enough for me
[12/4/17, 4:50:01 PM] Miller: but idk wtf you ppl are doing i pay 147/mo for every channel ever invented and redzone
[12/4/17, 4:50:06 PM] Miller: after taxes etc...
[12/4/17, 4:50:15 PM] Donk: fios?
[12/4/17, 4:50:21 PM] Donk: and that includes internet?
[12/4/17, 4:50:21 PM] Miller: fios
[12/4/17, 4:50:23 PM] Miller: yes
[12/4/17, 4:50:33 PM] Justin: becuase none of those non triple play tv packages have normal channels
[12/4/17, 4:50:46 PM] Donk: i priced out fios not that long ago and it was like 195 for what i have now, let alone anyone evertyhing
[12/4/17, 4:50:47 PM] Justin: you grandfathered in presumably on decent deal
[12/4/17, 4:51:02 PM] Miller: im not grandfathered into anything they just re-did my contract like 1mo ago
[12/4/17, 4:51:03 PM] Justin: its essential or sprts package if you want cheap
[12/4/17, 4:51:12 PM] Justin: cant get both unless you go triple play
[12/4/17, 4:51:13 PM] Launchpad: But they can't 'afford' to invest because the rich rigged the game
[12/4/17, 4:51:35 PM] Miller: wouldnt they be kicking me off if i was grandfathered in? why would they be voluntarily lowering my expense
[12/4/17, 4:52:01 PM] Justin: well for one you have no boxes
[12/4/17, 4:52:05 PM] Justin: so thats like 17$
[12/4/17, 4:52:27 PM] Justin: you may have your own router? another 10$
[12/4/17, 4:52:28 PM] Donk: how do you have no boxes? thats a thing with fios?
[12/4/17, 4:52:41 PM] Justin: he has cable cards
[12/4/17, 4:53:28 PM] Donk: what is a cable card?
[12/4/17, 4:53:29 PM] Scott: Da fuk is a cable card?
[12/4/17, 4:53:36 PM] Justin: for tivo
[12/4/17, 4:54:00 PM] Justin: also asusming you pay over 100 already
[12/4/17, 4:54:06 PM] Donk: tivo?
[12/4/17, 4:54:13 PM] Miller: i dont have my own router, i have there router
[12/4/17, 4:54:17 PM] Miller: i do pay 0 box fees
[12/4/17, 4:54:24 PM] Miller: (as everyone should)
[12/4/17, 4:54:36 PM] Miller: the payback on buying a tivo is like 12mo
[12/4/17, 4:54:37 PM] Donk: you have your own tv boxes with cable cards from fios?
[12/4/17, 4:54:44 PM] Miller: only need 1 cable card and 1 tivo
[12/4/17, 4:54:47 PM] Miller: and then some tivo minis
[12/4/17, 4:54:50 PM] Miller: which work as extenders
[12/4/17, 4:54:59 PM] Donk: do you buy these cable cards seperately?
[12/4/17, 4:55:02 PM] Justin: any annoyance of delaing with my cable is down issues presumably
[12/4/17, 4:55:05 PM] Donk: or does fios lend them to you?
[12/4/17, 4:55:09 PM] Miller: no you rent the cable card for $3/mo
[12/4/17, 4:55:31 PM] Miller: so you get better experience (fios dvr is meh) and save money
[12/4/17, 4:55:32 PM] Miller: no brainer
[12/4/17, 4:55:53 PM] Donk: this does sound like a no brainer, i assume it would also work with regular cable?
[12/4/17, 4:55:58 PM] Miller: i did this when i saw it was going to cost me like $70/mo for 5 boxes and only 1 of which was DVR
[12/4/17, 4:56:03 PM] Miller: i dont see why not
[12/4/17, 4:56:09 PM] Miller: the boxes are a fucking racket
[12/4/17, 4:56:29 PM] Miller: $20 normal box, $30 with DVR, $40 with multiroom DVR like FOH
[12/4/17, 5:03:20 PM] Donk: based on the preliminary research i just did, you cant get video on demand with it? (not a deal breaker, just curious)
[12/4/17, 5:03:35 PM] Donk: at least that is what optimums website says
[12/4/17, 5:09:22 PM] Miller: Correct
[12/4/17, 5:09:32 PM] Miller: I use HBO go if needed
[12/4/17, 5:16:25 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/4/17, 5:19:18 PM] Brian Katz: Wentz is like a foot taller
[12/4/17, 5:22:51 PM] Donk: alright, i think im going to do this cable box thing, seems like a no brainer, any particular box you would recommend?
[12/4/17, 5:23:30 PM] Justin: yeh wait until next black friday
[12/4/17, 5:24:27 PM] Donk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqQ99s4Ywnw
[12/4/17, 5:25:14 PM] Justin: nah im sure its similar price
[12/4/17, 5:25:19 PM] Miller: I got the roamio I think, they run these tivo promos pretty often for like box and lifetime for 700 bucks
[12/4/17, 5:25:26 PM] Justin: they ususally have some kind blackfriday deal i think though
[12/4/17, 5:25:28 PM] Miller: I'll let you know next time I get an email
[12/4/17, 5:25:56 PM] Donk: any reason to buy the specific tivo branded one and not a generic one?
[12/4/17, 5:26:03 PM] Launchpad: anyone have Cody?
[12/4/17, 5:26:08 PM] Launchpad: anyone even know what that is?
[12/4/17, 5:26:18 PM] Launchpad: Im suprised @15166335046 doesn't have it
[12/4/17, 5:26:52 PM] Donk: cody is different from Kodi?
[12/4/17, 5:27:09 PM] Donk: i just assumed you got auto-corrected earlier

[12/4/17, 5:28:26 PM] Donk: but have used Kodi before jailbreaking fire sticks for old people (ie the inlaws and some family friends)
[12/4/17, 5:28:39 PM] Donk: surprisingly easy to jail break those things, which is probably why they are so popular
[12/4/17, 5:28:52 PM] Donk: thanks!

[12/4/17, 5:34:09 PM] Miller: 15 bucks monthly
[12/4/17, 5:34:20 PM] Donk: but what are you paying them for?
[12/4/17, 5:35:02 PM] Launchpad: I have a slight feeling that this guy, and not the roommate is the annoying one...
[12/4/17, 5:35:27 PM] Miller: I just look at as 700 all in and about 2 years payback on 30 per month box, the real leverage comes on the minis

[12/5/17, 10:37:45 AM] Miller: Gross af
[12/5/17, 10:39:52 AM] Donk: mcdonalds may be the grossest of the traditional fast food places
[12/5/17, 10:40:07 AM] Donk: or in fact, i will be definitive, and say, yes it is the grossest
[12/5/17, 10:41:29 AM] Scott: Would never even contemplate ordering it.
[12/5/17, 10:42:36 AM] Kiyoon: whats your fav fast food donk
[12/5/17, 10:43:46 AM] Miller: Idk I don't think McDonald's is any grosser than anywhere else
[12/5/17, 10:45:45 AM] Donk: my favorite is taco bell
[12/5/17, 10:45:56 AM] Donk: but id consider wendy's the least gross
[12/5/17, 10:47:28 AM] Launchpad: my favorite guilty pleasure
[12/5/17, 10:47:34 AM] Kiyoon: I agree with Wendys but I cant believe you think Tbell is less gross than mcdonalds
[12/5/17, 10:48:30 AM] Miller: Taco bell is objectively gross but also delicious
[12/5/17, 10:48:42 AM] Launchpad: nah
[12/5/17, 10:48:50 AM] Miller: Lol inside source
[12/5/17, 10:49:17 AM] Launchpad: hahaha
[12/5/17, 10:49:27 AM] Miller: Launchpad we need you to go work at McDonald's burger King taco bell as well and report back with your findings and compare and contrast
[12/5/17, 10:49:45 AM] Miller: You can write a book afterwards
[12/5/17, 10:49:50 AM] Launchpad: grossest might have to be churches chicken
[12/5/17, 10:49:53 AM] Miller: To offset any lost wages
[12/5/17, 10:50:49 AM] Miller: Realistically I think probably any Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in is grosser than McDonald's
[12/5/17, 10:53:34 AM] Kiyoon: you bite your tongue miller
[12/5/17, 10:53:54 AM] Miller: Super üì†

[12/5/17, 11:33:41 AM] Launchpad: @16316620763 Is Bitcoin in a bubble?

Today's chart shows that the gamblers are back in the Wall Street "casino"...
 
Longtime readers know that some of the world's most popular gaming stocks have surged higher this year. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is up more than 80% since January. People have enough cash on hand to spend lots of it on gambling. And similarly, stock traders are rushing in from the sidelines...
 
Discount online brokers such as Interactive Brokers (IBKR), E-Trade Financial (ETFC), and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) are riding this trend. Last quarter, Interactive Brokers increased its customer accounts by 24% year over year to 457,000. TD Ameritrade had a strong quarter, too... Its sales jumped 18% from the same quarter last year to a new record high. And E-Trade's total sales grew 23% year over year to $599 million last quarter.
[12/5/17, 11:33:59 AM] Launchpad: Looks like everyones throwing around money these days
[12/5/17, 11:37:25 AM] Launchpad: hahaha https://www.facebook.com/BroBible/videos/10155926466214911/
[12/5/17, 12:12:47 PM] Justin: yes....is this gibberish supposed to mean something to me?
[12/5/17, 12:14:20 PM] Justin: was this from your monthly guru investment letters, am I supposed to buy/sell gaming stocks?  Essentially what is your point
[12/5/17, 12:18:09 PM] Miller: I think it's saying you are supposed to build a time machine and buy Wynn in January
[12/5/17, 1:10:39 PM] Launchpad: its not a recommendation to buy or sell anything, only evidence that money is loose and flowing everywhere
[12/5/17, 1:11:12 PM] Launchpad: this authors opinion is that we're on the verge of a massive stock market bubble that will melt up then melt down around 2019 / 2020
[12/5/17, 1:11:26 PM] Launchpad: doesn't know much about or own any bitcoin
[12/5/17, 1:15:28 PM] Justin: so did he reference that wynn stock is still down around 80% from 2013?
[12/5/17, 1:15:45 PM] Justin: or is that completely irrelevant to a theoritcal discussion on stock value
[12/5/17, 1:16:01 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/5/17, 1:16:54 PM] Launchpad: its not relevant or a recommendation to buy or sell WYNN -- only that investors have been buying it up lately as gambling volume is returning to casinos
[12/5/17, 1:17:06 PM] Justin: from where?
[12/5/17, 1:17:33 PM] Launchpad: dont know
[12/5/17, 1:17:40 PM] Justin: does he mean in china/macau?  ebcuase i can tell you landbased casinos in the US havent been doing well, which he seems to imply the opposite of
[12/5/17, 1:17:54 PM] Launchpad: i dont know herman
[12/5/17, 1:18:32 PM] Justin: but dont let any of that get in the way of rpoving a point that without any historical refference to the actual value of wynn and its overseas and local operation, he will use that to propose the stock amrket is currently overreacting and will slow down 2 years from now
[12/5/17, 1:18:34 PM] Launchpad: just keep arguing that the world is going to end and don't profit from that knowledge I guess
[12/5/17, 1:18:47 PM] Justin: becuase after all 80% in one year is crazzzzzy
[12/5/17, 1:19:00 PM] Launchpad: im sorry
[12/5/17, 1:19:05 PM] Launchpad: you're a genius
[12/5/17, 1:19:08 PM] Launchpad: you've thought of everything
[12/5/17, 1:19:13 PM] Justin: know im arguing that perhaps people need to make thorugh arguments
[12/5/17, 1:19:21 PM] Justin: best argument you made in your life was yesterday kevin spacy argument
[12/5/17, 1:19:33 PM] Launchpad: you argue for the sake of arguing and never change your own mind or anyone elses mind
[12/5/17, 1:19:50 PM] Justin: it was compltely fair reponse, porposing a completely rational explanation
[12/5/17, 1:20:35 PM] Launchpad: alright well Im going to the gym to make some Gainz in the real world
[12/5/17, 1:20:53 PM] Justin: no im saying if in 2 mins of thinkign and research i can throw the assumptions of a "financial analyst" into the gutter, its not really groundbreaking research or empiracally tested
[12/5/17, 1:20:57 PM] Justin: its words on a fucken paper
[12/5/17, 1:21:05 PM] Justin: as am I lol
[12/5/17, 1:22:04 PM] Launchpad: except you didn't prove anything yourself, you're just asking nitpicky annoying time consuming questions
[12/5/17, 1:22:23 PM] Launchpad: you did not throw any assumptions of a "financial analyst" into the gutter
[12/5/17, 1:22:26 PM] Justin: time consuming ?
[12/5/17, 1:22:44 PM] Launchpad: yes I need to go to they gym and work my J.O.B
[12/5/17, 1:23:20 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/5/17, 1:23:47 PM] Launchpad: how about you explain how it is relevant
[12/5/17, 1:24:15 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/5/17, 1:24:23 PM] Launchpad: you also completely ignored the big rise in new stock trading accounts
[12/5/17, 1:24:47 PM] Justin: i know nothing about them, wouldnt even know where to begin with them
[12/5/17, 1:24:36 PM] Launchpad: lol a chart with no label
[12/5/17, 1:24:57 PM] Launchpad: how is anyone supposed to know wht the fuck those mean
[12/5/17, 1:25:02 PM] Justin: theyre the same stock
[12/5/17, 1:25:07 PM] Launchpad: that makes all of us
[12/5/17, 1:25:20 PM] Launchpad: so fucking what
[12/5/17, 1:25:24 PM] Launchpad: what is your fucking point
[12/5/17, 1:25:30 PM] Justin: on one case the stock is down 50% sonce peak in 2014 or its reaching its pre peak levels
[12/5/17, 1:25:37 PM] Justin: in the other its up 80% this year
[12/5/17, 1:25:45 PM] Launchpad: AND?
[12/5/17, 1:26:00 PM] Justin: how could you ignore that historical data and use the 80% to make a conclusion?
[12/5/17, 1:26:44 PM] Justin: you better have some strong fucken justification as to why the bottom was where it was, the top was where it was, and what changed
[12/5/17, 1:27:30 PM] Launchpad: ok great you pulled out one piece of data from a larger statement
[12/5/17, 1:27:31 PM] Justin: this is not to say i have any idea as to the direction of the market
[12/5/17, 1:27:41 PM] Launchpad: you ignored all the new stock traders coming into the market
[12/5/17, 1:27:53 PM] Justin: its just thats clearly disingenuous to use Wynn stock
[12/5/17, 1:28:07 PM] Launchpad: you don't know what you're talking about\
[12/5/17, 1:28:15 PM] Launchpad: if you did you would be a market wizard
[12/5/17, 1:28:20 PM] Launchpad: everything cant be wrong all the time
[12/5/17, 1:28:37 PM] Launchpad: just bet against everything and get rich
[12/5/17, 1:28:55 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/5/17, 1:29:06 PM] Justin: sands is up about 12% ytd
[12/5/17, 1:29:12 PM] Justin: why the discrepancy in the gambling industry?
[12/5/17, 1:29:37 PM] Justin: shouldnt it be up 80% if people are gambling more
[12/5/17, 1:30:14 PM] Launchpad: no you fool
[12/5/17, 1:30:33 PM] Launchpad: do coke and pepsi go up the same percent every year? Verizon and AT&T?
[12/5/17, 1:30:41 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/5/17, 1:30:40 PM] Launchpad: they are different busineses
[12/5/17, 1:30:49 PM] Launchpad: but they are in the same industry and in an uptrend
[12/5/17, 1:31:05 PM] Launchpad: MGM trending up
[12/5/17, 1:31:14 PM] Launchpad: hmmmmm....Im beginning to notice a trend
[12/5/17, 1:31:25 PM] Justin: he didnt say sands is competevily at a disadvantage.  He claimed that industry wide changes, ala  more gambling
[12/5/17, 1:32:02 PM] Justin: yeh im notcing a trend.. if he used 12-20% gains as proof of an irrational exuberance in the market, you would been like but bitcoin made me 10000%
[12/5/17, 1:32:27 PM] Launchpad: yes you fool because the crypto market is much much smaller than the equity market
[12/5/17, 1:32:41 PM] Justin: and look i think the market is irrationaly exuberant, i think stock buybacks and consolidation and mergers are driving a theoretical bubble of an economy
[12/5/17, 1:32:47 PM] Launchpad: how much has apple stock risen since inception??
[12/5/17, 1:32:56 PM] Launchpad: google?
[12/5/17, 1:33:03 PM] Justin: doesnt mean i think looking at one stock going up 80% means anything, specifally in the context that the industry as a whole isnt up 80%
[12/5/17, 1:33:17 PM] Justin: when your entire argument is that it should be
[12/5/17, 1:33:49 PM] Justin: "have surged higher this year. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is up more than 80% since January. People have enough cash on hand to spend lots of it on gambling. And similarly, stock traders are rushing in from the sidelines"
[12/5/17, 1:33:47 PM] Launchpad: Can you read??? He named 4 different stocks in that statement
[12/5/17, 1:33:52 PM] Justin: brillant analysis
[12/5/17, 1:34:03 PM] Launchpad: you're the worst
[12/5/17, 1:34:06 PM] Justin: lol
[12/5/17, 1:34:16 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/5/17, 1:34:30 PM] Justin: in fairness i started with an easy answer of yes
[12/5/17, 1:34:36 PM] Launchpad: if your analysis was good you would make money from it but your all talk
[12/5/17, 1:35:33 PM] Justin: my analysis isnt that good
[12/5/17, 1:35:40 PM] Justin: its just a general macro analysis
[12/5/17, 1:35:42 PM] Launchpad: https://api.cointelegraph.com/amp/v1/news/jpmorgan-switches-tact-backs-bitcoin-as-new-gold
[12/5/17, 1:36:19 PM] Launchpad: my general macro analysis is buy crypto, buy weed, buy tech & buy stocks (and maybe housing too)
[12/5/17, 1:36:29 PM] Launchpad: its been working so far...
[12/5/17, 1:37:18 PM] Justin: not bad, id hope you were taking macro news into account with those things, but hey it is working
[12/5/17, 1:37:33 PM] Justin: so the end obviously justifies the means if you cna retire at 40
[12/5/17, 1:37:56 PM] Launchpad: yup
[12/5/17, 1:38:07 PM] Launchpad: if the money is sitting right there, reach out and take it
[12/5/17, 1:41:06 PM] Justin: fyi im not all that shocked that banks and other financial institutions will take the systemic risk of bitcoin onto their asset sheets given that they are too big too fail
[12/5/17, 1:41:16 PM] Justin: im sad, but not shocked
[12/5/17, 1:41:44 PM] Justin: at least if this bubble popped before it could pose a risk to the entire financial system, it would ahv eonly screwed over investors
[12/5/17, 1:41:57 PM] Justin: well come back to that in 5 years
[12/5/17, 1:42:24 PM] Launchpad: i hope this lasts 5 years
[12/5/17, 1:42:30 PM] Launchpad: would be great

[12/6/17, 8:58:23 AM] Brian Katz: Seriously what did she do? I just want to know what it takes to become person of the year? Like drop an album with moderate success? Be pretty?
[12/6/17, 8:58:41 AM] Launchpad: ^^^
[12/6/17, 8:58:43 AM] Donk: i do thnk its weird that they tied taylor swift into the #metoo movement
[12/6/17, 8:58:51 AM] Launchpad: voice of a generation
[12/6/17, 8:58:56 AM] Scott: O no. U just started a war with miller
[12/6/17, 8:58:58 AM] Donk: i dont remeber her being involded with any of it
[12/6/17, 8:59:03 AM] Brian Katz: Was she raped? Or harassed?
[12/6/17, 8:59:17 AM] Launchpad: she sued a radio dj who grabber her ass
[12/6/17, 8:59:29 AM] Launchpad: really lame
[12/6/17, 8:59:33 AM] Brian Katz: Other than Kayne
[12/6/17, 9:01:47 AM] Miller: @16318489683
[12/6/17, 9:01:53 AM] Miller: Taylor Swift says she was made to feel bad about the consequences that her harasser faced. After she complained about a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller, who reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end, Mueller was fired. He sued Swift for millions in damages. She countersued for a symbolic $1 and then testified about the incident in August. Mueller‚Äôs lawyer asked her, on the witness stand, whether she felt bad that she‚Äôd gotten him fired.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault,‚Äù she told the lawyer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine.‚Äù (Mueller said he would appeal.)

In an interview with TIME, Swift says that moment on the stand fueled her indignation. ‚ÄúI figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúimagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance.‚Äù Like the five women gathered at that echoing soundstage in San Francisco, and like all of the dozens, then hundreds, then millions of women who came forward with their own stories of harassment, she was done feeling intimidated. Actors and writers and journalists and dishwashers and fruit pickers alike: they‚Äôd had enough. What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage. Fear became fury.
[12/6/17, 9:03:28 AM] Donk: yeah, i guess thats fair, though all of this took place way before the whole metoo thing started
[12/6/17, 9:03:35 AM] Donk: the lawsuit and everything i mean
[12/6/17, 9:03:46 AM] Donk: its like they are tacking her on to this just to put her on the cover
[12/6/17, 9:05:56 AM] Miller: Well it worked
[12/6/17, 9:06:17 AM] Miller: It was this summer so it wasn't way before
[12/6/17, 9:29:25 AM] Donk: https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/434gqw/i-made-my-shed-the-top-rated-restaurant-on-tripadvisor
[12/6/17, 9:35:15 AM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm still shocked that‚Äôs all it took to become Times person of the year. Has the bar been set so low that that‚Äôs all it took?
[12/6/17, 9:49:29 AM] Justin: Agreed
[12/6/17, 9:55:20 AM] Scott: Standing up to a pattern of systematic persistent sexual abuse which is commonplace in today's society?  Seems like no big deal.
[12/6/17, 9:55:57 AM] Scott: Being a public figure worth millions getting sued for calling someone out on sexual abuse and not deciding to pay it off cause u can?
[12/6/17, 9:57:07 AM] Kiyoon: OOOOOOOOUUUUUU
[12/6/17, 9:57:10 AM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/6/17, 9:58:27 AM] Donk: yeah, i think its fine that they made this the person of the year, i just think that tswift was shoehorn'd in for publicity
[12/6/17, 9:59:00 AM] Justin: Yeh come on now.
[12/6/17, 10:00:43 AM] Miller: Best part is steve works for time Inc, he's extra salty today
[12/6/17, 10:01:26 AM] Miller: Herman doesn't think her sexual assault was bad enough
[12/6/17, 10:01:37 AM] Justin: Lol
[12/6/17, 10:01:39 AM] Miller: Maybe if she had been raped she could get on the cover
[12/6/17, 10:02:46 AM] Justin: Should Cyntonia Brown be person of the year?
[12/6/17, 10:03:36 AM] Justin: I mean in the end it's whatever. Time can choose whoever they want.
[12/6/17, 10:04:31 AM] Scott: And it's not just her it's other people on there and it's really a representative selection with her and others at the forefront of the movement.
[12/6/17, 10:05:07 AM] Justin: Once again, was she at the forefront of the movement?
[12/6/17, 10:05:18 AM] Scott: If it's whatever, why r u arguing ?  Clearly this means alot to you.
[12/6/17, 10:05:30 AM] Scott: Her and others, yes.
[12/6/17, 10:05:37 AM] Donk: ironic given you keep arguing too cheese
[12/6/17, 10:05:39 AM] Justin: No it doesn't I argue over meaningless shit all the time ?
[12/6/17, 10:06:26 AM] Justin: I'm just saying it's blah
[12/6/17, 10:06:32 AM] Justin: Good for swizzle
[12/6/17, 10:06:55 AM] Scott: Imho
[12/6/17, 10:07:31 AM] Scott: Never said it was meaningless
[12/6/17, 10:14:26 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 10:14:46 AM] Kiyoon: lolz
[12/6/17, 10:15:27 AM] Donk: im surprised they didnt go kapernick
[12/6/17, 10:15:48 AM] Donk: seemed like an easy pick to me to get a whole bunch of controversy, and therefore publicity
[12/6/17, 10:20:20 AM] Brian Katz: Nah he doesn‚Äôt support our our troops lol
[12/6/17, 11:24:27 AM] Justin: after actually seeing this cover, thats a littl ebetter
[12/6/17, 11:25:26 AM] Justin: i kinda figured it was gonna be saudi prince
[12/6/17, 11:26:07 AM] Justin: so considering hes likely a douchebag, i'm actually in favor of the me too movement
[12/6/17, 11:54:38 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 11:54:44 AM] Miller: gotta love this generation
[12/6/17, 11:55:29 AM] Justin: I mean she does have god knows how many millions of followers she cna influence with her voice, but her doing it silently in a courtroom makes alot of sense
[12/6/17, 11:55:57 AM] Miller: if you dont post about it on social media, did it really even happen?
[12/6/17, 11:55:57 AM] Donk: i feel like tswift went to the Michael Jordan school of public persona
[12/6/17, 11:55:59 AM] Miller: who knows
[12/6/17, 11:56:07 AM] Donk: conservatives buy records too
[12/6/17, 11:56:42 AM] Justin: yeh,look shes a great pop artist
[12/6/17, 11:57:04 AM] Miller: how about not counting on musicians or celebrities to tell us how to feel about politics?
[12/6/17, 11:57:09 AM] Justin: ok
[12/6/17, 11:57:17 AM] Justin: but thats not the implication of connecting her to metoo mvoement
[12/6/17, 11:57:20 AM] Miller: not sure when we entered this world where everyone has to have an opinion about everything and share it, all the time
[12/6/17, 11:57:48 AM] Miller: so her being sexually assaulted is lessened b/c she didnt post about the experience in 140 characters with a hashtag
[12/6/17, 11:57:54 AM] Justin: if you're being rewarded for bein an agent of social change, well then presumably you should be an agent of social change?
[12/6/17, 11:58:09 AM] Justin: no
[12/6/17, 11:58:57 AM] Donk: no, but her being included on this cover implies that she has been part of the movement, which she has not
[12/6/17, 11:59:13 AM] Donk: and there is nothing wrong with her not being involved with politics and social justice
[12/6/17, 11:59:17 AM] Donk: thats fine
[12/6/17, 11:59:18 AM] Miller: well im not going to define "the movement", thats not my job
[12/6/17, 11:59:25 AM] Donk: however, she is being celebrated as if she is
[12/6/17, 11:59:30 AM] Miller: apparently time feels her actions are representative
[12/6/17, 11:59:33 AM] Justin: lol yeh its times job apprently
[12/6/17, 11:59:43 AM] Miller: well its their magazine so.......?
[12/6/17, 11:59:44 AM] Miller: yes?
[12/6/17, 11:59:47 AM] Donk: more like time feels like they will sell more magazines
[12/6/17, 11:59:52 AM] Justin: or time thinks it sells magazines to put her on cover
[12/6/17, 11:59:56 AM] Donk: and to be fair, we are talking about it as a result
[12/6/17, 12:00:11 PM] Miller: you can put #ALLLIVESMATTER with a picture of kapernick on the front of HERMAN magazine if you want
[12/6/17, 12:00:15 PM] Justin: look i dislike most her music,
[12/6/17, 12:00:30 PM] Scott: she dislikes most of your music too.
[12/6/17, 12:00:36 PM] Justin: and i think metoo movement surely is deserving
[12/6/17, 12:00:57 PM] Justin: so whatever
[12/6/17, 12:01:23 PM] Justin: if it tkaes putting t swift on the cover to get a movement that is long overdue its spotlight, fine
[12/6/17, 12:02:23 PM] Justin: but you cant in one breath say its not her job to be an agent of social change, then claim she is in fact an agent of social change.  hes historically apolitical and has been attacked for it in the past
[12/6/17, 12:02:39 PM] Miller: im not claiming that, i dont run time magazine
[12/6/17, 12:02:42 PM] Miller: just in case you forgot
[12/6/17, 12:03:07 PM] Justin: no the kochs do lol
[12/6/17, 12:03:11 PM] Miller: i dont think she would be claiming that either, clearly she has done things to make points that are important to her when she feels compelled
[12/6/17, 12:03:24 PM] Justin: cant wait for all the white power heads to explode over their princess making the cover
[12/6/17, 12:04:12 PM] Miller: i dont think its her job to be an agent of change, i respect her for standing up for herself in this specific instance and i think it sets a good example, but past that who gives a fuck
[12/6/17, 12:04:35 PM] Miller: is eminem telling his (many many many) trump supporter fans to go fuck themselves going to change anything?
[12/6/17, 12:05:19 PM] Justin: i mean, is eminem anti trump?
[12/6/17, 12:05:23 PM] Miller: seems about as likely as T$ tweeting out a picture of herself at the womens march (and the flip side of course is anything she does do "in support" is seen as opportunistic)
[12/6/17, 12:05:54 PM] Justin: thats fair, it is a catch 22
[12/6/17, 12:07:38 PM] Miller: yes i would say eminem is anti trump
[12/6/17, 12:36:27 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 12:37:07 PM] Justin: the catch is you spent 5000 and havent been reimbursed yet
[12/6/17, 12:37:21 PM] Launchpad: didnt you just buy a bunch of shit and return it?
[12/6/17, 12:37:30 PM] Miller: i did lol
[12/6/17, 12:37:32 PM] Miller: #loophole?
[12/6/17, 12:38:38 PM] Miller: ha i decided to check but no i have been refunded
[12/6/17, 1:04:29 PM] Brian Katz: Use it quick before they realize lol
[12/6/17, 1:07:56 PM] Launchpad: https://thehustle.co/intermittent-fasting-experiment
[12/6/17, 1:09:36 PM] Justin: there is evidence of fasting being beneficial
[12/6/17, 1:10:37 PM] Justin: *for weight loss
[12/6/17, 1:11:05 PM] Brian Katz: Really? Damn so easy when you think about it.
[12/6/17, 1:11:15 PM] Launchpad: absolutely - when I don't eat I have a ton of energy
[12/6/17, 1:11:19 PM] Justin: almost had a chance to agree with LP on something
[12/6/17, 1:11:27 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/6/17, 1:11:30 PM] Justin: now that i dont agree with lol
[12/6/17, 1:15:27 PM] Justin: on another note it would be hilarious if trump somehow made peace in israel conflict
[12/6/17, 1:16:15 PM] Justin: I mean, he's much more likely to cause an escalated war in israel and N korea, but would be funny
[12/6/17, 1:17:06 PM] Brian Katz: This peace will be HUGE. It‚Äôll be the best. No peace will be as peaceful as this peace.
[12/6/17, 1:17:24 PM] Justin: im listening to him sniff on tv now, guy is wo wierd
[12/6/17, 1:17:45 PM] Justin: says like 10 words than takes a kamaya maya breath
[12/6/17, 3:32:22 PM] Scott: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 3:35:37 PM] Dan Watts: lmao
[12/6/17, 3:35:43 PM] Justin: Haha
[12/6/17, 3:35:53 PM] Justin: Happy lp?
[12/6/17, 3:37:01 PM] Miller: did i just spring back from my conference and off the subway to get to my computer to buy taylor swift tickets?
[12/6/17, 3:37:02 PM] Miller: yes i did
[12/6/17, 3:37:06 PM] Miller: #TimePOY
[12/6/17, 3:43:56 PM] Dan Watts: lol
[12/6/17, 3:50:50 PM] Brian Katz: Front row
[12/6/17, 3:50:52 PM] Miller: people see a grownup in a suit running they get out of your way, assuming i have important bizness to attend
[12/6/17, 3:50:53 PM] Brian Katz: ?
[12/6/17, 3:50:59 PM] Miller: na those were $1500
[12/6/17, 3:51:11 PM] Miller: and standing room GA near the stage were $800 ea
[12/6/17, 3:51:20 PM] Miller: and GA for this type of show would be hell for me
[12/6/17, 3:51:34 PM] Brian Katz: Damn Taylor commands more than hova?
[12/6/17, 3:54:23 PM] Justin: How you gonna be able to get a taste of that swizzle sweat if you ain't front row
[12/6/17, 3:55:03 PM] Miller: ill settle for being in her presence
[12/6/17, 3:55:27 PM] Miller: its a magical experience, highly recommend
[12/6/17, 3:55:44 PM] Launchpad: how much were your seats and how far away are you?
[12/6/17, 3:56:17 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 3:56:19 PM] Miller: im in section 117 and 129
[12/6/17, 3:56:22 PM] Miller: row  4 and 10
[12/6/17, 3:56:27 PM] Miller: and they were 210 and 170
[12/6/17, 3:56:49 PM] Donk: crazy how much she charges for tickets
[12/6/17, 3:57:02 PM] Miller: yea, good money if you can get it
[12/6/17, 3:57:09 PM] Miller: jay did same thing w/444 with this tour
[12/6/17, 3:57:17 PM] Miller: i think theyre trying to cut off the scalping market
[12/6/17, 3:57:20 PM] Miller: by just charging more
[12/6/17, 3:57:33 PM] Donk: yeah, i hear that, but still, crazy high
[12/6/17, 3:57:57 PM] Miller: yea would blow if i was like trying to take my kids and was poor etc...
[12/6/17, 3:58:19 PM] Miller: no different than going to a football game though
[12/6/17, 3:59:07 PM] Donk: no, but its high in comparison to other musical acts
[12/6/17, 3:59:17 PM] Launchpad: how does that work??
[12/6/17, 3:59:31 PM] Miller: instead of selling a floor seat for $200
[12/6/17, 3:59:37 PM] Miller: and then someone reselling it on stubhub for $700
[12/6/17, 3:59:41 PM] Miller: she sells it for $700
[12/6/17, 4:01:00 PM] Donk: i think instead, they should go to ticketless entry at these things
[12/6/17, 4:01:12 PM] Donk: and you have to swipe the CC you paid for the tickets with to get in the door
[12/6/17, 4:01:17 PM] Donk: that would severly hamper scalping
[12/6/17, 4:01:45 PM] Miller: only issue with that is it fucks over consumers
[12/6/17, 4:01:49 PM] Miller: not a huge %
[12/6/17, 4:01:53 PM] Donk: im not against the open market, however, the intial onsale is so unfair to average consumer
[12/6/17, 4:01:54 PM] Miller: but some % of ppl will have issues come up
[12/6/17, 4:02:19 PM] Donk: im sure something like 5% of the total tickets sold for Tswift were bought by actual people in the onsale
[12/6/17, 4:02:26 PM] Donk: the vast majority of the tickets end up in the hands of resellers
[12/6/17, 4:02:32 PM] Launchpad: you know I already solved this with blockshare technology
[12/6/17, 4:02:45 PM] Donk: enough with the blockchain already
[12/6/17, 4:02:56 PM] Donk: its exhausting
[12/6/17, 4:02:57 PM] Donk: we get it
[12/6/17, 4:03:00 PM] Launchpad: p2p tickets where you can programmatically set 're-sell' ceiling value on the ticket
[12/6/17, 4:03:08 PM] Launchpad: its going to happen Donk
[12/6/17, 4:03:21 PM] Donk: i know, im just tired of hearing you and herman talk about it
[12/6/17, 4:04:07 PM] Miller: i dont think so
[12/6/17, 4:04:13 PM] Miller: she used the TM verifiedtix system
[12/6/17, 4:04:23 PM] Miller: which idk totally effective but i imagine severely limits bots
[12/6/17, 4:04:46 PM] Miller: i still dont get it
[12/6/17, 4:04:48 PM] Miller: im okay w/that though
[12/6/17, 4:04:55 PM] Donk: i dont think the even use bots that much anymore
[12/6/17, 4:05:04 PM] Miller: oh absolutely
[12/6/17, 4:05:05 PM] Donk: they just farm out it to call centers basically
[12/6/17, 4:05:16 PM] Donk: and have dozens of people waiting to enter captchas
[12/6/17, 4:07:24 PM] Brian Katz: What if you just limited the number of tix that could be purchased by one account or CC to 4.
[12/6/17, 4:07:51 PM] Miller: doesnt help
[12/6/17, 4:07:57 PM] Miller: i have 4 CCs and im on the low end
[12/6/17, 4:08:46 PM] Launchpad: You sell tickets like 'coins' - each ticket has a unique private key that can be transferred to another individual safely & instantly. Since its in software you can programmatically set a price ceiling on each ticket to mitigate scalping
[12/6/17, 4:08:46 PM] Donk: yeah, they just open up a million accounts/credit cards
[12/6/17, 4:08:47 PM] Miller: and they already limit the # of tickets per account
[12/6/17, 4:09:43 PM] Miller: they can effectively do that now by just setting a ceiling or not allowing sales on stubhub considering they have like 90% resale market share
[12/6/17, 4:13:14 PM] Brian Katz: Why does everything have to be coin based with you scotty?
[12/6/17, 4:13:54 PM] Dan Watts: lol
[12/6/17, 4:13:55 PM] Launchpad: Im just saying that is how the technology will solve the problem in the future
[12/6/17, 4:14:05 PM] Launchpad: In fact I looked into doing it myself
[12/6/17, 4:14:57 PM] Donk: part of the problem is regulation vs industry
[12/6/17, 4:15:19 PM] Donk: apparently in NY until recently, the ticketless system was outlawed due to some good lobbying by resellers
[12/6/17, 4:15:32 PM] Donk: which is just ridiculous of course
[12/6/17, 4:17:31 PM] Dan Watts: you know what's ridiculous? I have the shittiest health insurance imaginable and it's costing me $500 a month starting next year.
[12/6/17, 4:17:45 PM] Donk: damn, thats rough
[12/6/17, 4:18:22 PM] Miller: thanks obama?
[12/6/17, 4:19:18 PM] Launchpad: thats crazy - do you have an HSA?
[12/6/17, 4:19:28 PM] Dan Watts: i need to marry someone with a civil service job or a teacher STAT
[12/6/17, 4:19:29 PM] Justin: Just drop it?
[12/6/17, 4:19:41 PM] Miller: eh, teacher insurance is overrated
[12/6/17, 4:19:56 PM] Dan Watts: it's free tho...
[12/6/17, 4:19:58 PM] Donk: disagreed, at least for NYC teachers
[12/6/17, 4:20:06 PM] Donk: free for spouse and any children
[12/6/17, 4:20:09 PM] Donk: cant beat that
[12/6/17, 4:20:12 PM] Miller: nicole taught in harlem
[12/6/17, 4:20:15 PM] Miller: the price is good
[12/6/17, 4:20:22 PM] Miller: and ill take it vs paying myself when im retired
[12/6/17, 4:20:41 PM] Miller: but i was on it for a bit when i was unemployed
[12/6/17, 4:20:42 PM] Miller: and eh
[12/6/17, 4:20:43 PM] Miller: not great
[12/6/17, 4:20:50 PM] Donk: i have had no problems with it so far
[12/6/17, 4:20:52 PM] Launchpad: As long as you don't have crazy medical expenses, the best way is to get an HSA and fill it with cash until you got a nice buffer
[12/6/17, 4:20:55 PM] Miller: needed referrals for shit
[12/6/17, 4:21:07 PM] Donk: no you dont
[12/6/17, 4:21:11 PM] Donk: at least not the plan liz has
[12/6/17, 4:21:15 PM] Dan Watts: HSA is not insurance
[12/6/17, 4:21:17 PM] Miller: im shocked @16195657200 would advocate self insuring
[12/6/17, 4:21:25 PM] Dan Watts: you cant substitute it
[12/6/17, 4:21:40 PM] Miller: i mean you can
[12/6/17, 4:21:40 PM] Miller: and people do
[12/6/17, 4:21:43 PM] Launchpad: well you need a high deductible plan thats elible
[12/6/17, 4:21:44 PM] Dan Watts: really?
[12/6/17, 4:21:49 PM] Miller: but its obviously a different plan
[12/6/17, 4:21:54 PM] Miller: and product
[12/6/17, 4:22:01 PM] Miller: and only offered through employers
[12/6/17, 4:22:11 PM] Dan Watts: i'm my own employer
[12/6/17, 4:22:15 PM] Miller: i dont believe there is a public option
[12/6/17, 4:22:31 PM] Miller: one of hillarys plans was to push HSAs as a public option
[12/6/17, 4:22:36 PM] Dan Watts: trying to hold down a young G on the come up
[12/6/17, 4:22:47 PM] Donk: is there some lawyers trade assocation or something you can join that offers plans?
[12/6/17, 4:23:06 PM] Donk: i know that the aicpa has something like that
[12/6/17, 4:23:15 PM] Justin: This
[12/6/17, 4:23:41 PM] Miller: i know you arent going to do this but its pretty dumb more people dont get fake married
[12/6/17, 4:24:00 PM] Miller: just marry cheese and take his insurance
[12/6/17, 4:24:14 PM] Launchpad: if you can find a high deductible plan that lets you open an HSA, its good down the road but shitty in the beginning
[12/6/17, 4:24:41 PM] Justin: Than divorce and get 20% uber
[12/6/17, 4:24:52 PM] Dan Watts: lmao
[12/6/17, 4:26:00 PM] Launchpad: since its higher deductible, its lower monthly premium.  And instead of just paying just the premium every month, you can deposit cash tax free into your HSA account which is basically like a health IRA
[12/6/17, 4:26:31 PM] Donk: but can you contribute to it in bitcoin?
[12/6/17, 4:26:42 PM] Miller: yea i had one at my old job, its in theory ideal for a healthy single male
[12/6/17, 4:26:45 PM] Dan Watts: idk if that's available for the self-employed
[12/6/17, 4:26:50 PM] Launchpad: then you can pay for all your medical expenses with that account, like I just did at the dentist
[12/6/17, 4:26:55 PM] Dan Watts: that does sound appealing
[12/6/17, 4:27:10 PM] Launchpad: you can open a bitcoin IRA
[12/6/17, 4:27:13 PM] Justin: Or why not just invest said money?
[12/6/17, 4:27:30 PM] Justin: Other than tax implication
[12/6/17, 4:27:39 PM] Launchpad: you can invest in mutual funds in an HSA
[12/6/17, 4:27:42 PM] Miller: you answered your own question
[12/6/17, 4:28:10 PM] Justin: Still premium costs
[12/6/17, 4:28:12 PM] Launchpad: any money in there is yours for life and you can pass it on
[12/6/17, 4:28:48 PM] Miller: generational wealth thats the key
[12/6/17, 4:29:30 PM] Dan Watts: Financial freedom my only hope
[12/6/17, 4:29:31 PM] Launchpad: you can pay for your medical expenses with tax free dollars that you never would have had if you were on a low deductible / high premium plan
[12/6/17, 4:29:37 PM] Justin: Just saying if you pay 1 k on 4k in premium seems like a wash
[12/6/17, 4:29:39 PM] Dan Watts: Fuck living rich and dying broke
[12/6/17, 4:29:56 PM] Justin: Just go uninsured?
[12/6/17, 4:29:56 PM] Launchpad: and at retirement age you can pay taxes and withdraw cash
[12/6/17, 4:30:21 PM] Dan Watts: I heard max they can fine you is $1300 for the year
[12/6/17, 4:30:37 PM] Justin: And it's out of rebate
[12/6/17, 4:30:46 PM] Justin: So get a good acct
[12/6/17, 4:31:01 PM] Dan Watts: 4K a year for peace of mind
[12/6/17, 4:31:11 PM] Justin: 6k
[12/6/17, 4:31:16 PM] Justin: But fair
[12/6/17, 4:31:29 PM] Justin: Depends on deductible though
[12/6/17, 4:31:41 PM] Dan Watts: 6k per year but your fined $1300 by Uncle Sam
[12/6/17, 4:31:43 PM] Justin: If that's 6-12k. Not much piece of mind
[12/6/17, 4:31:55 PM] Dan Watts: That‚Äôs a good point
[12/6/17, 4:32:33 PM] Justin: I gave up last year  three in towel on Obamacare
[12/6/17, 4:32:34 PM] Dan Watts: 5k deductible
[12/6/17, 4:32:49 PM] Justin: Threw*
[12/6/17, 4:33:35 PM] Justin: Think donk has best idea.
[12/6/17, 4:33:44 PM] Justin: Look for an association
[12/6/17, 4:33:57 PM] Justin: Gotta be one
[12/6/17, 4:34:35 PM] Dan Watts: i'll look but i doubt it
[12/6/17, 4:34:36 PM] Launchpad: and as long as you dont have upcoming medical expenses that you foresee, try to find yourself an HSA
[12/6/17, 4:35:40 PM] Dan Watts: i need a personal assistant
[12/6/17, 4:35:43 PM] Donk: is there a main lawyer assocaiton or something?
[12/6/17, 4:35:47 PM] Donk: american bar assocaiton?
[12/6/17, 4:35:47 PM] Dan Watts: to manage these administrative affairs for me
[12/6/17, 4:35:59 PM] Donk: i cant imagine that they dont offer health insurance for members
[12/6/17, 4:36:09 PM] Dan Watts: American Bar Association, all that give you is discount on hertz rentals
[12/6/17, 4:43:43 PM] Dan Watts: https://www.freelancersunion.org/health/details/bronze/?zip=10302
[12/6/17, 4:44:22 PM] Dan Watts: canada here i come eh
[12/6/17, 4:52:17 PM] Dan Watts: you know who doesn't care about $500 a month health insurance?
[12/6/17, 4:52:20 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21691975/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-signs-contract-extension
[12/6/17, 4:52:56 PM] Justin: Idk how much uncertainty of eliminating mandate played in new premiums, but if you think 500 is bad wait until next year
[12/6/17, 4:55:30 PM] Miller: still some uncertainty if that makes it into the final bill
[12/6/17, 4:55:56 PM] Justin: http://www.abainsurance.com/health-insurance/individual-medical/
[12/6/17, 4:55:58 PM] Justin: ??
[12/6/17, 4:56:42 PM] Miller: is there a question there?
[12/6/17, 4:56:51 PM] Justin: It's bar association
[12/6/17, 4:57:08 PM] Justin: They offer brag insurance. Not sure it will be any cheaper. But worth a shot
[12/6/17, 4:57:18 PM] Justin: Brag insurance lol
[12/6/17, 4:57:30 PM] Justin: Best kind of insurance
[12/6/17, 4:58:35 PM] Scott: $470/mo the cheapest
[12/6/17, 4:59:02 PM] Miller: brag insurance
[12/6/17, 4:59:09 PM] Launchpad: Outrageous
[12/6/17, 4:59:12 PM] Miller: just in case you are unable to brag about being a lawyer
[12/6/17, 4:59:15 PM] Miller: this has you covered
[12/6/17, 4:59:39 PM] Dan Watts: $470 through ABA
[12/6/17, 4:59:43 PM] Justin: Take out your aba healthplan cArd, bitches love Aba cards
[12/6/17, 5:00:02 PM] Miller: i hear dropping it is the new "dropping the atm receipt"
[12/6/17, 5:00:07 PM] Justin: Plus medical secretary gonna give you the eye
[12/6/17, 5:00:18 PM] Justin: It's panty dropper
[12/6/17, 5:00:37 PM] Dan Watts: that in and of itself is worth it
[12/6/17, 5:01:25 PM] Justin: I'd say 90% of those women working 50 hours a week at 12$ an hr are looking to lock up a lawyer
[12/6/17, 5:01:43 PM] Justin: The single ones at least?
[12/6/17, 5:01:44 PM] Scott: you could have been one of those women
[12/6/17, 5:02:01 PM] Justin: Nah I was only gonna make 10
[12/6/17, 5:02:13 PM] Justin: I wasn't good enough to get a lawyer
[12/6/17, 5:02:43 PM] Miller: idk i cant think of any lawyers i know who dated their secretaries
[12/6/17, 5:02:59 PM] Justin: Lol
[12/6/17, 5:02:59 PM] Scott: i can't either.
[12/6/17, 5:03:22 PM] Launchpad: they weren't dating just living together
[12/6/17, 5:03:27 PM] Justin: Yeh I know one that skipped whole dating part though.
[12/6/17, 5:03:28 PM] Scott: she also wasn't my secretary
[12/6/17, 5:04:08 PM] Scott: also made more than that
[12/6/17, 5:05:12 PM] Miller: more than $12/hr? damn you were gonna pay herman $10 but she gets $15/hr? hmmm wonder why
[12/6/17, 5:05:24 PM] Justin: More evidence that 500 will be like 600+ next year
[12/6/17, 5:05:40 PM] Scott: cause she had experience, among other assets.
[12/6/17, 5:05:51 PM] Miller: too bad you arent cheeses type @16316620763
[12/6/17, 5:06:04 PM] Miller: only way to get that firm to open their wallets
[12/6/17, 5:06:19 PM] Scott: for anyone other than me.
[12/6/17, 5:06:52 PM] Launchpad: open legs not wallets
[12/6/17, 5:07:12 PM] Launchpad: timeless advice for the Tinder generation
[12/6/17, 5:07:51 PM] Miller: sorry ticketmaster was not accepting genitals as payment
[12/6/17, 5:08:11 PM] Launchpad: not even pubes?
[12/6/17, 5:08:22 PM] Launchpad: pubes is just as good as money
[12/6/17, 5:08:22 PM] Miller: not even a drawing of a spider with 7 legs
[12/6/17, 5:27:42 PM] Scott: she also deserved the money because she had experience...something @16316620763 doesn't.
[12/6/17, 5:32:17 PM] Justin: Experience with that dick
[12/6/17, 5:39:39 PM] Miller: *COINBASE CEO: WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE PAY TAXES ON BITCOIN GAINS
[12/6/17, 5:39:43 PM] Miller: *COINBASE CEO: WORKING WITH IRS ON WAYS FOR USERS TO PAY TAXES
[12/6/17, 5:40:07 PM] Scott: no, work experience...something you would have had already had you been employed prior to your interview.
[12/6/17, 5:49:34 PM] Dan Watts: üìâ
[12/6/17, 5:49:48 PM] Justin: Haha.

[12/6/17, 6:08:55 PM] Miller: i think the one in the middle is going to be a disaster when you get those jeans off
[12/6/17, 6:09:25 PM] Brian Katz: The one in the middle is rough

[12/6/17, 6:44:04 PM] Miller: Ugh
[12/6/17, 6:44:13 PM] Miller: Sorry, that blows
[12/6/17, 6:44:23 PM] Scott: That really sucks. Asshole
[12/6/17, 6:44:30 PM] Scott: Not u the hospital
[12/6/17, 6:44:34 PM] Scott: Did she get severance?
[12/6/17, 6:44:44 PM] James  L: Horrible they gave her boxes to pack up her shit... didn‚Äôt even construct them for here
[12/6/17, 6:44:48 PM] Miller: Maybe not the worst timing? Would be worse to go ball out for Xmas and then get fired
[12/6/17, 6:45:11 PM] James  L: I got mad paper cuts putting the boxes together
[12/6/17, 6:45:37 PM] James  L: They offered her another job for 6 months that was also being phased out in 6 moths
[12/6/17, 6:45:55 PM] James  L: I had to terminate cause she was under me
[12/6/17, 6:47:22 PM] Scott: Same pay?
[12/6/17, 6:47:30 PM] James  L: She was an older lady been with the hospital for 20 years
[12/6/17, 6:47:39 PM] Brian Katz: Wow that sucks
[12/6/17, 6:47:40 PM] James  L: Nope
[12/6/17, 6:48:03 PM] Scott: Age discrimination ?
[12/6/17, 6:48:12 PM] James  L: Less money and the hospital doesn‚Äôt pay her it was a grant job that the grant is up in 6 months
[12/6/17, 6:48:30 PM] James  L: Na
[12/6/17, 6:48:50 PM] Scott: I can make it sound like it
[12/6/17, 6:48:55 PM] James  L: Hahah
[12/6/17, 6:48:59 PM] James  L: Of course you can
[12/6/17, 6:49:22 PM] James  L: Can you believe she was the least senior in the department
[12/6/17, 6:50:38 PM] Miller: Your honor I present exhibit a this old ass woman. I rest my case.

[12/6/17, 7:34:06 PM] Miller: @jillboard: Swift's impact was huge, too. Per her case, from @washingtonpost: "After the trial, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) rape crisis hotline saw a 35 percent increase in calls throughout a single weekend." https://t.co/0FyF2FlavH
[12/6/17, 7:39:00 PM] Justin: So that we're clear apparently that women's opinion on Facebook matters to you?
[12/6/17, 7:40:59 PM] Brian Katz: They should have put oj Simpson on the cover. Home slice did time and first thing he did when he got out was get kicked out of every hotel in Vegas.
[12/6/17, 7:41:42 PM] Justin: Thanks for posting an article that agrees that she is historically apolitical?  Glad we agree
[12/6/17, 7:43:25 PM] Miller: Because if you didn't post a snapchat of your hillary ballot then who cares if you get sexually assaulted?
[12/6/17, 7:44:39 PM] Justin: Yeh that's what I said.
[12/6/17, 7:45:21 PM] Justin: I'm saying for someone being credited with promoting awareness of sexual assaualt she fails at that miserably.
[12/6/17, 7:45:40 PM] Launchpad: what makes you think that words speak louder than actions?
[12/6/17, 7:47:36 PM] Justin: Actions are never louder Han words. Bird law
[12/6/17, 7:48:22 PM] Justin: And she has plenty of opportunity to take action. Anytime she wants she can work with these groups or spread awareness
[12/6/17, 7:49:08 PM] Miller: It's the same typical Herman argument he makes about her donating millions of dollars, he doesn't approve of her choices in charities therefore it isn't good enough
[12/6/17, 7:49:32 PM] Justin: im not getting into it
[12/6/17, 7:49:45 PM] Justin: im sorry taylor swift is very political
[12/6/17, 7:49:51 PM] Justin: her music addreses politics
[12/6/17, 7:49:53 PM] Justin: her actions as well
[12/6/17, 7:49:56 PM] Justin: and her words on social media
[12/6/17, 7:49:59 PM] Miller: She sent kesha 250k to help with her lawsuit? Sure money is cool and all but have you heard of retweets?
[12/6/17, 7:50:02 PM] Justin: she is a poltiical pop star
[12/6/17, 7:50:06 PM] Justin: i retract everything
[12/6/17, 7:50:22 PM] Miller: Sorry was the cover of the magazine political monthly?
[12/6/17, 7:50:34 PM] Miller: Did she beat out system of a down?
[12/6/17, 7:50:49 PM] Justin: please continue to obfuscate my point
[12/6/17, 7:50:50 PM] Miller: You seem unable to comprehend sexual assault is not a political issue
[12/6/17, 7:51:15 PM] Justin: you also posted an article that literally addresses the same thing
[12/6/17, 7:52:02 PM] Justin: 40% of women in america her assualted at some point int heir life, but yeh taylor swift being on the cover of the me too movement isnt about selling magazines
[12/6/17, 7:52:33 PM] Justin: would the me too movement have been just as important absent her on the cover?
[12/6/17, 7:52:43 PM] Miller: And now we're back to her assault not being bad enough to justify her being on the cover
[12/6/17, 7:52:47 PM] Justin: is it better with her on the cover, possibly
[12/6/17, 7:53:59 PM] Justin: look like the wapo article points out, she can condemn the nazis who think shes their princess with one tweet
[12/6/17, 7:54:20 PM] Justin: i suppose its extremely poltiical to tell nazis you think they are pieces of shit
[12/6/17, 7:54:54 PM] Justin: if thats the case, i find it hard to believe her intentions are to be political when she donates money....seems very bottom lineish
[12/6/17, 7:55:49 PM] Miller: Herman please point me to your tweets in which you condemn nazis? Because you know if you somehow don't have any I'm going to be forced to believe that you shoot nazis
[12/6/17, 7:55:52 PM] Justin: yes thats my opinon, no i'm not taylorswift, and honestly her music is lame and directed at pubescent teenagers, so whatever
[12/6/17, 7:56:05 PM] Miller: Support
[12/6/17, 7:56:08 PM] Miller: Damn it
[12/6/17, 7:56:26 PM] Justin: i mean you probably chose the wrong candidate for that
[12/6/17, 7:56:36 PM] Justin: ive definitley posted its always ok to punch a nazi
[12/6/17, 7:56:48 PM] Miller: Please link me to your tweets
[12/6/17, 7:56:50 PM] Justin: but i mena its kinda irrelevant either way
[12/6/17, 7:56:54 PM] Miller: It's not
[12/6/17, 7:57:04 PM] Justin: i dont hav ea platform to reach millions of people
[12/6/17, 7:57:08 PM] Justin: its wholey relevant
[12/6/17, 7:57:10 PM] Miller: You think she has some obligation to respond to this stupid bullshit
[12/6/17, 7:57:18 PM] Miller: Which just gives it more attention
[12/6/17, 7:57:25 PM] Justin: she cant go cursing on her facebook like a fucken drunken sailor either
[12/6/17, 7:57:29 PM] Justin: so clearly its relavent
[12/6/17, 7:58:01 PM] Miller: Has every celebrity publicly condemned nazis? What about condemning sexual assault? What about genocide in general?
[12/6/17, 7:58:41 PM] Miller: Does LeBron James support North Korea? I don't think he's ever publicly condemned them
[12/6/17, 7:58:51 PM] Justin: i mean every celebertiy doesnt have a cult of nazis supporting her
[12/6/17, 7:58:58 PM] Miller: If that's your bar for a celebrity it's ridiculous
[12/6/17, 7:59:27 PM] Justin: she can do whatever the fuck she wants to do
[12/6/17, 7:59:36 PM] Justin: she is apolitical, thats factual
[12/6/17, 7:59:44 PM] Miller: Nobody is disputing that
[12/6/17, 7:59:45 PM] Justin: is that bad, i dont fucken know
[12/6/17, 7:59:52 PM] Justin: its an example of LP favorite word
[12/6/17, 8:00:04 PM] Miller: Being apolitical is not relevant to being sexually assaulted
[12/6/17, 8:00:10 PM] Justin: does putting her on time magazine sell more magazines yes or no?
[12/6/17, 8:00:21 PM] Justin: is time a financially motivated business?
[12/6/17, 8:00:29 PM] Miller: Probably sells less than putting trump on there
[12/6/17, 8:00:54 PM] Justin: is her sexual assualt worth any less than the 40% of women....fuck no....its also not worth anymore they are all equally disgusting and deserving of attention
[12/6/17, 8:01:17 PM] Miller: And that anonymous elbow on the cover represents every anonymous woman
[12/6/17, 8:01:23 PM] Justin: perhaps an argument can be made, mroe copies sold, is more young women seeing this movement, and means more reporting and less assualts
[12/6/17, 8:01:30 PM] Justin: i dont see you making that argument
[12/6/17, 8:01:39 PM] Miller: Clearly time is going to be motivated to put more recognizable people on their cover
[12/6/17, 8:12:47 PM] Justin: my outrage was much more directed towards the fake news headlines i was presented this morning
[12/6/17, 8:13:43 PM] Justin: caller her time person of the year and linking it to the me too movement, pretty weak....putting her on the sover of the me too movement as a victem of sexual assault just oppurtunistic
[12/6/17, 8:14:05 PM] Justin: at least the me too movement is the person of the year, which is all that really matters
[12/6/17, 8:19:18 PM] Justin: onto the next issue

[12/7/17, 11:03:19 AM] Sean: Yeah we always get sat pretty quick
[12/7/17, 11:11:38 AM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 11:19:21 AM] Launchpad: I know everyones sick of it but bubble mania is reaching its peak üòÇ
[12/7/17, 11:19:36 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 11:24:38 AM] Launchpad: up another $1000 since I just posted that -- its gone full retard
[12/7/17, 11:34:33 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 11:35:46 AM] Donk: those damn liberal policies are destroying america
[12/7/17, 11:54:42 AM] Justin: Doug Jones mailer ..."he fucks little girls ".
[12/7/17, 11:54:43 AM] Brian Katz: You gonna sell?
[12/7/17, 11:58:29 AM] Launchpad: took some profits but only cause I expect it to crash back to a normal level
[12/7/17, 11:58:38 AM] Launchpad: might buy back in with it if it does
[12/7/17, 11:59:18 AM] Launchpad: right now everything is chaos
[12/7/17, 11:59:34 AM] Launchpad: coinbase is down, network is clogged, will take forever to get trades through
[12/7/17, 11:59:34 AM] Miller: everything is chaos
[12/7/17, 11:59:35 AM] Miller: eat arybs
[12/7/17, 11:59:44 AM] Launchpad: I got lucky to even get one sell order through
[12/7/17, 12:01:05 PM] Miller: you would think.....but no
[12/7/17, 12:01:13 PM] Miller: he went the use-minorities-as-a-prop route
[12/7/17, 12:01:16 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 12:01:17 PM] Launchpad: everyone and their mother wants in right now katz
[12/7/17, 12:26:47 PM] Justin: thats smart, that's how you get the black vote.....i swear democratic party consultants are paid to lose elections
[12/7/17, 12:27:48 PM] Brian Katz: Congrats
[12/7/17, 12:31:32 PM] Justin: take this al franken shit....I have not looked into any these womens claims, with 7 women surely Al franken is a creepo and should resign.  But that has nothing to do with the 20 democratic senators calling for his resignation.  They are doing that because they think it will help them win the alabama seat, because they want to stop the rights attacking point of equating Franken to Moore. It wont fucken stop that, all fox news will be talking about is how al franken had to resign because hes a molester and he admitted to it.  Meanwhile this pedophile in denying hes a pedophile, will be given the presumption of innocence.
[12/7/17, 12:36:32 PM] Dan Watts: i agree with everything you just said
[12/7/17, 12:37:13 PM] Miller: https://www.wsj.com/articles/birthright-israel-raises-eligibility-age-to-32-1512600935 @15165329107 good news
[12/7/17, 12:41:48 PM] Justin: @16195657200 so when do you cash out of the bubble, and actually begin doing some research as to what ico to invest in?
[12/7/17, 12:43:25 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 12:44:40 PM] Justin: oops highlighted watts thing by mistkae....lol.... but damn me wand watts agreeing over the internet, could only happen on noam chomsky day
[12/7/17, 12:47:52 PM] Brian Katz: Is it his birthday?
[12/7/17, 12:48:40 PM] Justin: yeh, sean shares his birthday with the most renown anti-capitalist on the planet
[12/7/17, 12:49:54 PM] Launchpad: do you even know what an ICO is?
[12/7/17, 12:50:55 PM] Justin: its a company who offers as equity in your investment in their blockchain tech, a cryto currency
[12/7/17, 12:51:10 PM] Justin: or in other words its the future according to you
[12/7/17, 12:51:20 PM] Launchpad: kind of
[12/7/17, 12:51:39 PM] Launchpad: its a crowdfunding
[12/7/17, 12:51:40 PM] Launchpad: **seed stage crowdfunding
[12/7/17, 12:51:54 PM] Justin: with what acting as the reserve currency for the market?
[12/7/17, 12:52:26 PM] Launchpad: you used to have to be an accredited investor in order to make those kinds of investments
[12/7/17, 12:52:28 PM] Launchpad: now anyone can
[12/7/17, 12:52:52 PM] Justin: so like i said.....when do you get out of the bubble, and into the actual tech of the future
[12/7/17, 12:53:01 PM] Launchpad: bitcoin and etherium
[12/7/17, 12:53:50 PM] Justin: just like .com bubble alot of these ico gonna fail and drive down price of bitcoin
[12/7/17, 12:54:13 PM] Justin: when do you start picking the google.com ?
[12/7/17, 12:55:53 PM] Launchpad: https://coinmarketcap.com/
[12/7/17, 12:55:57 PM] Launchpad: they're all listed on there
[12/7/17, 12:56:25 PM] Launchpad: yes a lot of those coins will end up in the toilet but we will also end up with the apples, googles & amazons of crypto
[12/7/17, 12:56:38 PM] Justin: yeh
[12/7/17, 12:56:43 PM] Launchpad: the .com bubble didn't kill tech, it accelerated its progress
[12/7/17, 12:56:58 PM] Justin: ok?
[12/7/17, 12:57:57 PM] Justin: but if you owned a general index fund in tech .coms you got crushed.....bitcoin is that general index fund...so like i said, how and when do you start doing the research as to what blockchain tech will be the future
[12/7/17, 12:58:12 PM] Justin: seems like that sthe next logical step
[12/7/17, 12:58:12 PM] Miller: im partial to dogecoin
[12/7/17, 12:58:45 PM] Launchpad: bitcoin is not a general index fund
[12/7/17, 12:59:09 PM] Launchpad: starting several years ago
[12/7/17, 12:59:31 PM] Justin: so the market is too oversaturated now?
[12/7/17, 12:59:34 PM] Launchpad: I don't just own bitcoin I own a handful of coins
[12/7/17, 12:59:41 PM] Launchpad: what is your fucken point?
[12/7/17, 12:59:55 PM] Dan Watts: lol
[12/7/17, 1:00:24 PM] Justin: question how do you choose which ico to invest in?
[12/7/17, 1:00:42 PM] Justin: answer: you choose several years ago, what is your fucken point
[12/7/17, 1:00:44 PM] Launchpad: you dont need to invest in any ICO
[12/7/17, 1:01:07 PM] Launchpad: clearly you are confused
[12/7/17, 1:01:17 PM] Launchpad: you don't need to invest in an ICO to buy alts
[12/7/17, 1:01:29 PM] Launchpad: as soon as it starts trading you can buy it on an open market
[12/7/17, 1:01:45 PM] Justin: i got you , i rephrase than, how do you chose alts
[12/7/17, 1:01:56 PM] Launchpad: how do you choose any investment
[12/7/17, 1:02:01 PM] Launchpad: how do you chose what stock to buy
[12/7/17, 1:02:07 PM] Justin: this circular logic is killing me
[12/7/17, 1:02:09 PM] Launchpad: how do you chose what to buy for lunch
[12/7/17, 1:02:17 PM] Justin: im asking you how you chose.
[12/7/17, 1:02:18 PM] Launchpad: your pointless questions are killing me
[12/7/17, 1:02:27 PM] Launchpad: do fucking research on the coin
[12/7/17, 1:02:38 PM] Justin: where cna i do research? simple google search?
[12/7/17, 1:02:50 PM] Launchpad: duh
[12/7/17, 1:03:06 PM] Launchpad: or, you can go to https://coinmarketcap.com/
[12/7/17, 1:03:19 PM] Justin: ok glad you thought this was a challenging and stupid question
[12/7/17, 1:03:21 PM] Launchpad: pick a coin that sounds interesting and go to their website
[12/7/17, 1:03:28 PM] Launchpad: see what problems they are trying to solve
[12/7/17, 1:03:55 PM] Justin: ok so instead of being defensive i would think you would be exicted to explain this
[12/7/17, 1:03:56 PM] Launchpad: you're making this out to be brain surgery - its not
[12/7/17, 1:04:05 PM] Justin: which you chose for instance and why
[12/7/17, 1:05:18 PM] Launchpad: Im defensive because you have a smug way of trying to put me on the spot and make it look like I don't know what Im doing and am lucky -- you're not actually interested in any of these coins, or you have made it look like you are showing any interest
[12/7/17, 1:06:06 PM] Justin: im interested in blockchain tech much more than bitcoin
[12/7/17, 1:06:06 PM] Launchpad: also you're basically asking me how to use google
[12/7/17, 1:06:20 PM] Justin: im not sure how feasable alot of the projects are right now, but its still interesting
[12/7/17, 1:06:28 PM] Justin: im well over bitcoin
[12/7/17, 1:07:05 PM] Dan Watts: herman knows how to use google it's on his resume
[12/7/17, 1:07:14 PM] Justin: master at excel as well
[12/7/17, 1:07:30 PM] Justin: i think im proficient at it
[12/7/17, 1:07:34 PM] Miller: great the one thing on hermans resume and its a lie
[12/7/17, 1:07:43 PM] Justin: lol
[12/7/17, 1:07:43 PM] Dan Watts: lol lol
[12/7/17, 1:08:00 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/7/17, 1:08:03 PM] Launchpad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP_hGPQVLpA
[12/7/17, 1:08:16 PM] Justin: took a class on that on udacity other day
[12/7/17, 1:08:19 PM] Justin: im good on ted talk
[12/7/17, 1:09:02 PM] Justin: i undertand the basic premise of blockchain tech and kinda understand the split from bitocin although thats little confusing
[12/7/17, 1:18:10 PM] Launchpad: If you REALLY want to start learning more, you need a little skin in the game
[12/7/17, 1:18:27 PM] Dan Watts: this is a very exciting opportunity
[12/7/17, 1:18:32 PM] Justin: correction you need that
[12/7/17, 1:18:46 PM] Dan Watts: only a few select people
[12/7/17, 1:18:48 PM] Justin: i love learning, financial motivation isnt what drives my learning
[12/7/17, 1:18:59 PM] Launchpad: and since crypto is infinitely subdivisible (in practical terms), you put in a little cash and split it up in as many ways as you'd like
[12/7/17, 1:19:02 PM] Dan Watts: Commie
[12/7/17, 1:19:08 PM] Justin: i mean perhaps it should be, that nnaother question
[12/7/17, 1:19:16 PM] Justin: lol
[12/7/17, 1:20:14 PM] Launchpad: hes so concerned with bubbles & bad coins and idiots who are going to lose their money he wants all crypto profits to be shared with everyone
[12/7/17, 1:20:49 PM] Launchpad: seriously, take $200 and split it among 5 coins
[12/7/17, 1:20:57 PM] Launchpad: you'll learn much faster
[12/7/17, 1:22:32 PM] Launchpad: you typically can't do that with a normal brokerage for stocks
[12/7/17, 1:23:41 PM] Launchpad: odds are $200 in crypto will make you more money than any NFL prop bets
[12/7/17, 1:26:33 PM] Justin: all i know is wild dan currently sitting on like 6 coins...best non sell ever
[12/7/17, 1:26:45 PM] Justin: he just told me he's waitng for 40k though
[12/7/17, 1:27:05 PM] Dan Watts: drinks on wild d next time he's in town
[12/7/17, 1:27:26 PM] Launchpad: lol good for him
[12/7/17, 1:27:35 PM] Justin: he also gave me one for my yearly movie donwload site when it was 20$
[12/7/17, 1:27:39 PM] Justin: so i cost him 20k
[12/7/17, 1:31:23 PM] Miller: im shocked you misplaced it
[12/7/17, 1:56:40 PM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 1:56:59 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/7/17, 3:41:40 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 3:42:25 PM] Justin: so bing students are rapists
[12/7/17, 3:42:45 PM] Justin: ouch
[12/7/17, 3:42:52 PM] Scott: Typical lp mess up
[12/7/17, 3:43:54 PM] Miller: https://twitter.com/BackAftaThis/status/938603086330900480
[12/7/17, 3:44:36 PM] Launchpad: Its a pretty vague worthless non-specific message
[12/7/17, 3:45:46 PM] Justin: haha i enver listened to one these nevah said that
[12/7/17, 3:46:06 PM] Justin: its like trump of newsradio
[12/7/17, 3:47:58 PM] Miller: I NEVAH SAID DAT
[12/7/17, 3:48:00 PM] Miller: its so good

[12/7/17, 3:54:03 PM] Donk: so much change in NYC sports radio
[12/7/17, 3:54:22 PM] Donk: francesca, carton, greenberg all gone within weeks of each other
[12/7/17, 3:58:28 PM] Launchpad: they had to step down they were about to get taken out #metoo
[12/7/17, 4:31:09 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/gma/hormonal-birth-control-linked-increased-breast-cancer-risk-032604304--abc-news-topstories.html
[12/7/17, 4:32:12 PM] Miller: nice, ill send that to nicole
[12/7/17, 4:32:29 PM] Justin: lol
[12/7/17, 4:32:44 PM] Miller: ive been telling her to stop, pointless and no way can it be good for you
[12/7/17, 4:33:00 PM] Justin: 100% figured sarcasm
[12/7/17, 4:33:20 PM] Miller: na
[12/7/17, 4:33:32 PM] Miller: im only sarcastic 80% of the time
[12/7/17, 4:34:22 PM] Justin: when she comes back with but how do they know it wasnt other things .......highlight this sentence "The researchers addressed potential confounding factors that, on their own, could increase breast cancer risk such as smoking, family history, prior pregnancies, body-mass index and education, as a marker for socioeconomic status."
[12/7/17, 4:34:56 PM] Miller: shes not gonna read it
[12/7/17, 4:35:07 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/7/17, 4:35:07 PM] Miller: or respond most likely
[12/7/17, 4:35:10 PM] Justin: well even more likely she will say it then
[12/7/17, 4:35:55 PM] Brian Katz: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1342696169120377/permalink/1622049337851724/
These things are a sandwich making ability away from replacing women lol

[12/7/17, 4:37:35 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 4:37:45 PM] Launchpad: whod fuck that doll?
[12/7/17, 4:38:00 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 4:38:35 PM] Launchpad: why would anyone need to talk to a real woman
[12/7/17, 4:38:37 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 4:38:46 PM] Miller: "everyone take the rest of the day off, i have extensive texting to do"
[12/7/17, 4:38:52 PM] Brian Katz: You guys were ready to give these three a spin yesterday lol
[12/7/17, 4:39:08 PM] Launchpad: they aren't even willing to discuss birth control articles on the internet
[12/7/17, 4:39:23 PM] Miller: this robot can have orgasms? bro if im fucking a sex robot in what world do you think i give a fuck about her satisfaction
[12/7/17, 4:39:52 PM] Launchpad: nah its like playing a video game
[12/7/17, 4:40:01 PM] Launchpad: you can't make a robot lose you fail
[12/7/17, 4:40:04 PM] Launchpad: **robot cum
[12/7/17, 4:40:17 PM] Donk: gotta make your robot orgasm or it will cheat on you
[12/7/17, 4:41:00 PM] Launchpad: the first year of the company was pretty rough. They all had to share the same prototype
[12/7/17, 4:41:07 PM] Brian Katz: A morality question. If you were in the matrix, would you sell out the crew of the nebikanazer like sypher did? Or would you live in that underground dial up modem world, trying to free the rest of the batteries so that you can all have a killer race near the earths core?
[12/7/17, 4:42:04 PM] Miller: who says we arent in the matrix?
[12/7/17, 4:42:53 PM] Scott: üò±
[12/7/17, 4:42:56 PM] Brian Katz: Rave*
[12/7/17, 4:43:25 PM] Brian Katz: Elon musk says it‚Äôs a certainty
[12/7/17, 4:43:38 PM] Brian Katz: Anyway same question applies.
[12/7/17, 4:44:21 PM] Justin: So you want the inception answer to the matrix now?
[12/7/17, 4:44:42 PM] Scott: Did u just reply to yourself?
[12/7/17, 4:46:00 PM] Donk: okafor to the nets
[12/7/17, 4:46:08 PM] Miller: emeka?
[12/7/17, 4:46:12 PM] Donk: strange that the 2 and 3 picks from that draft would end up on the nets
[12/7/17, 4:46:19 PM] Donk: yes, emeka
[12/7/17, 4:46:24 PM] Scott: Weird trade shows u how low his value is
[12/7/17, 4:46:35 PM] Donk: it was basically nothign
[12/7/17, 4:46:37 PM] Donk: he wasnt playing
[12/7/17, 4:46:37 PM] Scott: And frankly nice buy low move by nets
[12/7/17, 4:46:45 PM] Donk: agreed, same with the russell trade
[12/7/17, 4:46:46 PM] Scott: And get stauskis and draft pick
[12/7/17, 4:46:47 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 4:47:28 PM] Miller: ended up being dumb luck the knicks won those 2 or 3 games at the end of that season before
[12/7/17, 4:47:50 PM] Scott: Or dumb luck Knicks didn't draft him. They wanted him at one point too
[12/7/17, 4:49:01 PM] Donk: fun fact, emeka okafor led the nation in blocks in college during the 02-03 season - who was third in blocks that year?
[12/7/17, 4:49:17 PM] Scott: Your mom
[12/7/17, 4:49:23 PM] Donk: lame cheese
[12/7/17, 4:49:24 PM] Donk: just lame
[12/7/17, 4:49:33 PM] Scott: So I'm right ?
[12/7/17, 4:49:34 PM] Donk: and the answer is: Nick Billings form Binghamton!
[12/7/17, 4:49:57 PM] Scott: How long have u been waiting to share that ?
[12/7/17, 4:50:09 PM] Donk: 0 min
[12/7/17, 4:50:11 PM] Brian Katz: Melo
[12/7/17, 4:50:11 PM] Donk: i thought of it
[12/7/17, 4:50:13 PM] Donk: and shared it
[12/7/17, 4:50:18 PM] Brian Katz: Bosh
[12/7/17, 4:50:19 PM] Brian Katz: Wade
[12/7/17, 4:50:24 PM] Donk: what a waste Nick Billings was
[12/7/17, 4:50:27 PM] Donk: so tall, and pretty good
[12/7/17, 4:50:45 PM] Brian Katz: Wow
[12/7/17, 4:50:47 PM] Donk: but somehow could never dominate in our conference even though it was such a bad conference
[12/7/17, 4:55:09 PM] Miller: im dying, so brokers send us like holiday shit every yr around this time, usually simple stuff gift baskets, wine w/e, sometimes like an echo dot or ipod shuffle or w/e (has to be <$100 SEC regulations)
[12/7/17, 4:55:16 PM] Miller: and today our traders gets this

[12/7/17, 4:55:42 PM] Miller: its a fucking (huge) surfboard
[12/7/17, 4:55:48 PM] Miller: no, he doesnt surf
[12/7/17, 4:55:52 PM] Miller: they sent them to everyone apparently
[12/7/17, 4:56:21 PM] Miller: so now he either has to spend $50 (the cost of the surfboard) to ship it to his house, where it will not be used and take up space
[12/7/17, 4:56:40 PM] Miller: or he can bring it home with him on the ferry (which is not at all annoying)
[12/7/17, 4:56:49 PM] Miller: hes so annoyed about the whole thing, im dying laughing
[12/7/17, 4:56:54 PM] Miller: like who thought this was a good idea
[12/7/17, 4:57:00 PM] Donk: he can just mount it on top of those 19 monitors
[12/7/17, 4:57:25 PM] Miller: i feel like seding a shitty surfboard is the new www.bagofdicks.com
[12/7/17, 4:57:39 PM] Miller: i think im gonna send one to steves office
[12/7/17, 4:58:02 PM] Donk: lol
[12/7/17, 4:58:22 PM] Miller: the thought of him carrying it home w/him on the subway will bring me enough joy
[12/7/17, 5:00:39 PM] Dan Watts: Learning to surf is on my bucket list
[12/7/17, 5:00:44 PM] Dan Watts: Hold on to that ok bro
[12/7/17, 5:04:37 PM] Miller: maybe steve will regift his to you

[12/8/17, 11:57:07 AM] Justin: Expert move is to keep 1 bun or double meat on one sandwich.
[12/8/17, 11:57:56 AM] Miller: if i saw someone eating a big mac w/o buns i would think they are a fucking psychopath
[12/8/17, 11:58:07 AM] Scott: lol agreed

[12/8/17, 11:58:22 AM] Justin: I mean bigmac is a bread based sandwich
[12/8/17, 11:58:31 AM] Justin: It's barely got any meat
[12/8/17, 11:58:53 AM] Justin: So if you were gonna cut down on bread you would be an asshole if you did that with Big Macs
[12/8/17, 11:59:06 AM] Launchpad: Big Mac without a bun is fucken weird -- Double double protein style is where its at

[12/8/17, 12:34:52 PM] Justin: Maybe they just did partial.
[12/8/17, 12:35:22 PM] Justin: This doctor was taking the news show brought his factory of mice with other mice heads
[12/8/17, 12:35:22 PM] Brian Katz: Can you do a partial head transplant?
[12/8/17, 12:35:59 PM] Justin: Through his factory* (laboratory). Just seemed very Mary Shelly Frankenstein
[12/8/17, 12:36:30 PM] Justin: Was some guy in his 20's with some terminal neural disease I thought

[12/8/17, 2:58:07 PM] Scott: lolz, @17189742074 reserves lunch for only the finest spanish or dominican hunnies

[12/8/17, 3:59:52 PM] Miller: you are closer than you think
[12/8/17, 3:59:54 PM] Miller: but hes not going w/me
[12/8/17, 4:00:33 PM] Launchpad: damn, cant wait til he puts that ring on her, so I can start talking shit about her
[12/8/17, 4:00:46 PM] Launchpad: you know wives & gfs are considered fair game to Steve
[12/8/17, 4:01:04 PM] Miller: but in that case she is already fair game?
[12/8/17, 4:01:08 PM] Miller: so you dont need to wait?
[12/8/17, 4:01:33 PM] Justin: I'm fucked if he's that close
[12/8/17, 4:01:33 PM] Launchpad: true
[12/8/17, 4:01:45 PM] Launchpad: but I guess I should probably meet her first so I know what Im talking about
[12/8/17, 4:01:49 PM] Scott: how far away are you from it?
[12/8/17, 4:02:03 PM] Justin: Close proximity
[12/8/17, 4:02:15 PM] Launchpad: 1 Pt if this were horseshoes
[12/8/17, 4:02:16 PM] Miller: do her parents know you exist?
[12/8/17, 4:02:47 PM] Justin: That's a after the engagement conversation
[12/8/17, 4:02:56 PM] Scott: oh shit really?
[12/8/17, 4:03:01 PM] Scott: u aren't gonna meet parents pre-engagement?
[12/8/17, 4:03:21 PM] Launchpad: daaammn
[12/8/17, 4:03:25 PM] Miller: i thought for sure any kind of stricter ethnic culture asking her parents for permission would be a big thing
[12/8/17, 4:03:36 PM] Launchpad: where do they live?
[12/8/17, 4:04:08 PM] Donk: also, if there was ever a conversation to be had pre-engagement, that would probably be one
[12/8/17, 4:04:36 PM] Miller: dont sound so surprised, remember i used my detective skills and caught him ring shopping like a year ago
[12/8/17, 4:04:52 PM] Scott: lol i remember this...awesome targeted ads
[12/8/17, 4:05:08 PM] Donk: but you do hear all the time about people getting divorced because one of them doesnt want to have children or something like that, which always leave me scratching my head
[12/8/17, 4:05:47 PM] Miller: yea kids or religion not being ironed out before the engagement never makes any sense to me
[12/8/17, 4:06:23 PM] Miller: its one thing if kids cause your divorce b/c they drive you insane and you want to murder each other
[12/8/17, 4:06:49 PM] Donk: just never tell the kids that lol
[12/8/17, 4:07:28 PM] Miller: on the plus side it has made me 100000% sure i do not want to have a 3rd
[12/8/17, 4:49:43 PM] Kiyoon: Is Nicole ok with just two boys???
[12/8/17, 4:50:38 PM] Launchpad: the fuck does her opinion matter shes a woman

[12/8/17, 5:24:53 PM] Miller: It's not her first choice, but it's kind of my call
[12/8/17, 5:25:16 PM] Scott: "kind of?"
[12/8/17, 5:26:32 PM] Miller: Well children cost in excess of a million dollars and I'm the only one working so all that responsibility and stress is mine so yes it's basically my call
[12/8/17, 5:26:51 PM] Scott: i excepted thats where this was going to go
[12/8/17, 5:26:58 PM] Scott: a child costs in excess of a million dollars?
[12/8/17, 5:26:59 PM] Scott: damn brah
[12/8/17, 5:27:59 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs those high priced rich models, bottom line price on a kid about tree fifty
[12/8/17, 5:34:25 PM] Miller: College alone is almost 500k
[12/8/17, 5:37:14 PM] James  L: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/8/17, 5:37:24 PM] Launchpad: lol where you sending your kids that cost 500k
[12/8/17, 5:38:05 PM] Miller: Lol go run a calculator on the cost of college at a 40k annual cost today and get back to me
[12/8/17, 5:38:19 PM] Miller: Adjusted for the rate of college inflation
[12/8/17, 5:39:07 PM] James  L: That pretty accurate my advisor said i should expect to put away 440k for college for janes
[12/8/17, 5:39:29 PM] Launchpad: when does the bubble pop and prices come back down?
[12/8/17, 5:40:13 PM] James  L: Hoping soon don‚Äôt have 500 a month to put away for him
[12/8/17, 5:41:06 PM] Launchpad: you can save and invest tax free right miller?
[12/8/17, 5:41:13 PM] Launchpad: in the college savings account?
[12/8/17, 5:42:08 PM] Miller: Up to a certain amount yes
[12/8/17, 5:42:43 PM] Miller: That is taken into account
[12/8/17, 5:43:44 PM] James  L: There‚Äôs different  multiple account
[12/8/17, 5:44:55 PM] Justin: Never?
[12/8/17, 5:45:52 PM] Launchpad: were talking college tuition, not bitcoin
[12/8/17, 5:46:08 PM] Justin: I mean 80% of college workforce is being paid 22k a year. Where exactly are we gonna cut costs?
[12/8/17, 5:46:50 PM] Justin: If anything the republican tax plan will rise tuition costs because hey will have to pay adjuncts instead of giving stipends
[12/8/17, 5:47:06 PM] Launchpad: college workforce or college graduate workforce....
[12/8/17, 5:47:13 PM] Launchpad: 22k is burger flipping wages
[12/8/17, 5:50:03 PM] Justin: College adjuncts
[12/8/17, 5:50:11 PM] Justin: The teachers.
[12/8/17, 5:51:01 PM] Justin: Which make up about 80% of teaching positions
[12/8/17, 5:51:20 PM] Launchpad: no way I would spend 500k on a college education for my kid when all the best universities post their entire courses online for free
[12/8/17, 5:51:40 PM] Justin: That is a fair point about he future
[12/8/17, 5:51:44 PM] Launchpad: 500k for tutors for a drunk asshole
[12/8/17, 5:51:50 PM] Justin: At some point we may replace land based colleges
[12/8/17, 5:52:09 PM] Justin: But that's dependent on employers adjusting. Possible though
[12/8/17, 5:52:32 PM] Launchpad: what about this whole NY being the first state to offer free tuition?
[12/8/17, 5:52:35 PM] James  L: Yeah like the Harvard of the online schools
[12/8/17, 5:52:51 PM] James  L: If you make under 100k
[12/8/17, 5:53:05 PM] Justin: Yeh program is quite limited
[12/8/17, 5:53:35 PM] Launchpad: or just have him to to harvard for free
[12/8/17, 5:53:40 PM] Launchpad: https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx
[12/8/17, 5:54:14 PM] Launchpad: maybe start him off with this class https://www.edx.org/course/saving-schools-reforming-u-s-education-harvardx-1368x
[12/8/17, 5:55:06 PM] Launchpad: half of you motherfuckers in here never even went to class and still graduated
[12/8/17, 5:59:18 PM] Justin: Please don't
[12/8/17, 6:01:24 PM] Launchpad: I know everyone here pretty much disagrees with me and Elon Musk and James Altucher about the need to go to college, but think about it.  How fucken hard is college if a bunch of rowdy drunk 20 years who never show up to class can still pass and get a degree
[12/8/17, 6:01:49 PM] Justin: It's still a necessity.
[12/8/17, 6:01:58 PM] Justin: Employers will determine when it isn't
[12/8/17, 6:02:12 PM] Launchpad: what the fuck do you know about employers
[12/8/17, 6:02:21 PM] Justin: all the data points to that ?
[12/8/17, 6:02:30 PM] Justin: Literally all of it at all stages
[12/8/17, 6:02:54 PM] Justin: Direct increase in wages by level of education
[12/8/17, 6:03:21 PM] Launchpad: at my last company we had an entry level programmer with a psych degree
[12/8/17, 6:03:30 PM] Justin: Cool story?
[12/8/17, 6:03:38 PM] Justin: How many did you have withcollege degrees?
[12/8/17, 6:04:23 PM] Launchpad: the problem with the majority of those who don't go to college is they are too fucken stupid and unmotivated to go to college
[12/8/17, 6:04:48 PM] Launchpad: show me your studies where straight A students skipped college and can't get jobs
[12/8/17, 6:05:01 PM] Launchpad: no....its the liberal arts community college kids who cant get jobs
[12/8/17, 6:05:08 PM] Launchpad: **community college dropouts
[12/8/17, 6:06:08 PM] Justin: Wtf are you talking about?
[12/8/17, 6:06:36 PM] Justin: I'll show you studies where 95% straight a students go to college.
[12/8/17, 6:06:52 PM] Justin: So not sure what part of the workforce you want to not go to college
[12/8/17, 6:07:56 PM] Justin: College degrees are listed for entry level positions across most industry.
[12/8/17, 6:08:25 PM] Justin: In fact even your psych degree major went to college.
[12/8/17, 6:08:50 PM] Justin: So essentially no one is employed in your office without a college degree, yet you are advocating employers don't require it
[12/8/17, 6:08:55 PM] Launchpad: well it didn't help him get a programming degree
[12/8/17, 6:09:06 PM] Launchpad: **programming job
[12/8/17, 6:09:40 PM] Justin: Yeh it's the minimal requirement
[12/8/17, 6:09:52 PM] Justin: Hence until that changes...
[12/8/17, 6:10:31 PM] Justin: I'm not saying college degree should equal employment. I don't think that should be the case, I'm just saying it is the case
[12/8/17, 6:10:35 PM] Launchpad: you're not going to get the same job as your college peer right after high school -- but you've got a 4 year headstart
[12/8/17, 6:11:07 PM] Justin: Why bother to graduate high school?
[12/8/17, 6:11:20 PM] Justin: Nothing you learn senior year is necessary for the workforce?
[12/8/17, 6:11:33 PM] Justin: So why arbitrarily stop at college ?
[12/8/17, 6:16:51 PM] Launchpad: high school is free
[12/8/17, 6:24:05 PM] Miller: Pissing contest aside I'd like to give my kids the option
[12/8/17, 6:24:35 PM] Miller: If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen
[12/8/17, 6:24:47 PM] Launchpad: of course Im not worried about you having the money
[12/8/17, 6:25:21 PM] Launchpad: but in general if this is causing you stress, 500k for the average person is just not feasible
[12/8/17, 6:45:48 PM] Miller: Every day of life causes me stress, kids just add to it
[12/8/17, 7:23:32 PM] Brian Katz: Really? You should meditate bro. Let that stress out
[12/8/17, 7:44:36 PM] Launchpad: Lmao Miller meditating
[12/8/17, 7:44:58 PM] Launchpad: More likely to see Herman with a job

[12/8/17, 9:00:46 PM] Launchpad: Put it down on the board
[12/8/17, 9:00:59 PM] Launchpad: LTC up 40% today
[12/8/17, 9:01:24 PM] Launchpad: Bitcoin FOMO gonna hit litecoin hard
[12/8/17, 9:02:00 PM] Launchpad: And all you degenerate gamblers except KY are going too miss out
[12/8/17, 9:02:26 PM] Launchpad: You guys are pretty cheap tbh
[12/8/17, 9:04:08 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/8/17, 9:07:15 PM] Miller: I'm very cheap when it comes to investing money in things I don't understand
[12/8/17, 9:07:52 PM] Launchpad: Fair
[12/8/17, 9:07:57 PM] Launchpad: I don't understand bottle service
[12/8/17, 9:11:04 PM] Miller: It's not for everyone (or an investment)
[12/8/17, 9:11:39 PM] Launchpad: What is it then, bingo?
[12/8/17, 9:12:40 PM] Launchpad: Or you meant bottle service lol
[12/8/17, 9:15:32 PM] Miller: Obviously
[12/8/17, 9:18:17 PM] Launchpad: My point is that everyone here is somewhat of a gambler - why not drop some bets on some coins
[12/8/17, 9:19:00 PM] Launchpad: This isn't some safe 10% return. It's a 10x bet
[12/8/17, 9:19:34 PM] Launchpad: With much better odds than you hitting a parlay

[12/9/17, 12:24:14 AM] Miller: That's fucked up katz
[12/9/17, 12:25:04 AM] Brian Katz: Seeing again on Tuesday
[12/9/17, 12:25:10 AM] Brian Katz: You wanna join?
[12/9/17, 12:25:24 AM] Miller: You're dead to me
[12/9/17, 12:25:49 AM] Brian Katz: Mike why are you doing this to me. You‚Äôre TEARING ME APAAAAART
[12/9/17, 2:00:55 AM] Justin: Random guy at a bar told me and watts to buy lite coin, nothing weird about that
[12/9/17, 2:01:53 AM] Justin: He at least said it processes transactions 4x faster than bitcoin fwiw

[12/9/17, 8:34:56 AM] Brian Katz: Yankees got Giancarlo Stanton
[12/9/17, 8:35:21 AM] Scott: Other than Castro I can't see what else they gave up
[12/9/17, 8:35:30 AM] Scott: Judge stanton Sanchez is nuts
[12/9/17, 8:35:36 AM] Scott: As a 3 4 5
[12/9/17, 8:36:42 AM] Brian Katz: We‚Äôre stacked
[12/9/17, 8:37:09 AM] Brian Katz: They probably wanted to dump money
[12/9/17, 8:38:40 AM] Scott: Have a feeling it's Castro Ellsbury and some young arms
[12/9/17, 8:39:26 AM] Donk: Ellsbury doesnt make sense unless the yankees are picking up most of tge money
[12/9/17, 8:39:40 AM] Donk: Marlins are only trading Stanton to save cash
[12/9/17, 8:44:17 AM] Kiyoon: Litecoin up 60% since yesterday let's go!!
[12/9/17, 9:13:01 AM] Miller: Makes sense now the Yankees don't have to pay harper 500m
[12/9/17, 9:19:04 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/9/17, 9:25:49 AM] Scott: They will slide th3 best ss prospect in baseball at 2b next to didi
[12/9/17, 9:26:05 AM] Scott: I did really like rho that they had defensively up the middle
[12/9/17, 9:26:23 AM] Brian Katz: We still need a starter
[12/9/17, 9:27:08 AM] Scott: Resign cc on 1 year deal
[12/9/17, 9:27:15 AM] Brian Katz: Stanton should feast in Yankee stadium. Plus he‚Äôs got great protection
[12/9/17, 9:27:18 AM] Scott: And keep goin with young guys at end of roatafion
[12/9/17, 9:27:31 AM] Scott: And if need another starter get st deadline
[12/9/17, 9:28:37 AM] Brian Katz: Gray Severino and Tanaka isn‚Äôt a bad start. I agree resign cc on a one year deal, and sign or trade for a fifth starter
[12/9/17, 9:29:26 AM] Scott: I forgot their 5th starters name but I liked him alot
[12/9/17, 9:29:37 AM] Scott: Really consistent. I would pencil him in again
[12/9/17, 9:31:40 AM] Brian Katz: That guy? Sure pencil him in lol
[12/9/17, 9:46:24 AM] Launchpad: Nah I just hammer away at the cervix with my monster dong
[12/9/17, 9:47:03 AM] Launchpad: ü§úü§õ
[12/9/17, 9:47:40 AM] Miller: Here's the other issue
[12/9/17, 9:47:49 AM] Miller: Where is he playing
[12/9/17, 9:48:04 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[12/9/17, 9:48:21 AM] Brian Katz: DH who cares
[12/9/17, 9:48:49 AM] Miller: Locking up your dh spot for the foreseeable future isn't wise
[12/9/17, 9:48:53 AM] Miller: Need that for Sanchez
[12/9/17, 9:49:19 AM] Miller: I'm also not paying 35m a year for a dh that's crazy
[12/9/17, 9:49:36 AM] Miller: I would have rather signed harper and put him in cf
[12/9/17, 9:50:06 AM] Brian Katz: Have in with the Mets lineup for the next 4 years mike
[12/9/17, 9:51:04 AM] Brian Katz: Fun*
[12/9/17, 9:52:02 AM] Miller: Because that's relevant
[12/9/17, 9:53:05 AM] Brian Katz: We just acquired the nl mvp for starlin Castro. I‚Äôm at peace with that.
[12/9/17, 9:53:52 AM] Miller: And if we're playing fantasy baseball that's a great move
[12/9/17, 9:54:11 AM] Launchpad: thats a good move in real baseball too
[12/9/17, 9:54:44 AM] Brian Katz: Make one play left or 1st. Or don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt care. Our lineup is young and stacked
[12/9/17, 9:56:13 AM] Launchpad: they don't have the same politics behind them as bitcoin and have been faster to upgrade.  The "silver to bitcoins gold" is basically what its known as
[12/9/17, 9:56:18 AM] Miller: So let's see our options are trade for a guy we don't have a position for and give up a solid middle infielder we now have to replace or sign a better player to play a position of need and not give up anything
[12/9/17, 9:57:46 AM] Launchpad: when 'guy we don't have a postion for' happens to be an MVP and slugging champion you slide over and make room
[12/9/17, 9:58:45 AM] Brian Katz: Plus we have the top rated ss in the minors ready to come up. Now he has a spot with no pressure to perform.
[12/9/17, 10:11:03 AM] Dan Watts: This guy last night really seemed
To know what he was talking about
[12/9/17, 10:16:38 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/9/17, 10:17:19 AM] Scott: Yankees can afford to take on one huge contract
[12/9/17, 10:17:32 AM] Scott: They aren't the mets. Remember that @15166335046
[12/9/17, 10:18:11 AM] Scott: Yankees have the balls to win championships. Mets fans enjoy division titles like world series championships
[12/9/17, 10:18:20 AM] Miller: Every team has a budget, to think this doesn't impact the team budget going forward is silly
[12/9/17, 10:18:44 AM] Scott: Yes. Keep suckin off Jose Reyes. Swear he will be back in 2018 with David Wright to help bring you guys a chip
[12/9/17, 10:18:45 AM] Miller: I'll bet you an open Sam Adams summer seasonal pack the Yankees now don't sign harper
[12/9/17, 10:18:56 AM] Brian Katz: Is that Sherman‚Äôs take in this?lol
[12/9/17, 10:18:58 AM] Scott: That's stupid. I know they won't.
[12/9/17, 10:19:06 AM] Scott: They don't need him
[12/9/17, 10:19:11 AM] Miller: And what would you have said yesterday?
[12/9/17, 10:19:18 AM] Miller: They're def getting harper
[12/9/17, 10:19:26 AM] Scott: But I bet the yankees win a championship before the mets?
[12/9/17, 10:19:35 AM] Miller: But I thought money doesn't matter?
[12/9/17, 10:19:40 AM] Scott: U wanna make that bet big mouth?
[12/9/17, 10:19:50 AM] Scott: Guess not.
[12/9/17, 10:19:58 AM] Miller: It's funny when Yankee fans get defensive it's all about the mets
[12/9/17, 10:20:04 AM] Scott: üé§  cheese out
[12/9/17, 10:20:21 AM] Miller: The only impact this Stanton trade has on the mets is a positive one
[12/9/17, 10:20:59 AM] Miller: Cheese you wanna bet my fantasy team wins a chip before yours?
[12/9/17, 10:21:02 AM] Miller: Guess not
[12/9/17, 10:21:06 AM] Scott: U guys can't even resign jay Bruce
[12/9/17, 10:21:08 AM] Scott: Relax.
[12/9/17, 10:22:19 AM] Scott: Fantasy baseball yea.
[12/9/17, 10:22:25 AM] Scott: I'll bet that. U suck at fantasy baseball.
[12/9/17, 10:22:59 AM] Miller: I'll bet you don't win a fantasy baseball chip in the next 10 years in hermans league
[12/9/17, 10:23:41 AM] Miller: Mets fans "the mets suck"
[12/9/17, 10:23:49 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/9/17, 10:25:14 AM] Brian Katz: I don‚Äôt care about the Yankees payroll. At least there‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôm paying $11 for a beer at Yankee staudium.
[12/9/17, 10:26:09 AM] Miller: That's missing the point
[12/9/17, 10:26:14 AM] Miller: The Yankees care about it
[12/9/17, 10:26:33 AM] Miller: If the Yankees had literally unlimited resources then sure this is obviously a no brainer
[12/9/17, 10:28:02 AM] Brian Katz: They‚Äôre fine
[12/9/17, 10:28:48 AM] Miller: So they will still sign harper?
[12/9/17, 10:29:00 AM] Brian Katz: I hope
[12/9/17, 10:29:04 AM] Brian Katz: Sure let‚Äôs go

[12/11/17, 2:45:30 PM] Miller: my guess was he chose the path of least resistance
[12/11/17, 2:46:06 PM] Launchpad: that is a weird nomination
[12/11/17, 2:47:07 PM] Donk: it was a very good movie, def deserves to be nominated, but it is not a comedy
[12/11/17, 2:48:10 PM] Donk: ah, it seems that if you dont fit into the drama category directly, then you are shunted off to the other one
[12/11/17, 2:48:18 PM] Miller: im pretty sure it was peeles choice

[12/13/17, 12:35:51 PM] Launchpad: Saudi Arabia lifts a 35-year ban on movie theaters

Saudi Arabia has decided to fling open the once-locked doors to the movie biz -- lifting a ban on movie theatres they‚Äôve had since the ‚Äò80s.

This Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman‚Äôs latest effort to liberalize the uber-conservative nation (in September, he lifted the ban on women drivers as well).

The shift is not without debate: while SA‚Äôs social liberals are dead-set on finding ways to have a good time, religious conservatives argue that movies go against Islamic rules.

[12/13/17, 12:43:46 PM] Justin: i get it.  When the NYT flys its lead journalist out to interview the prince, they spend all night talking about all the amazing changes the prince plans and somehow the prince isnt asked about his policy of starvation and bombing, i'm not surprised when headlines read "people in saudia arabia can go to the movies".

[12/14/17, 9:11:31 AM] Donk: saw the disaster artist last night
[12/14/17, 9:11:32 AM] Donk: it was hilarious
[12/14/17, 9:11:41 AM] Donk: though would not have been nearly as funny if i hadnt seen the room
[12/14/17, 9:11:55 AM] Miller: nice, im going this weekend
[12/14/17, 9:11:58 AM] Miller: i was thinking about that
[12/14/17, 9:12:13 AM] Miller: did they f themselves over by making a movie that only like 10-20% of the population can enjoy?
[12/14/17, 9:12:14 AM] Brian Katz: That movie e was hilarious
[12/14/17, 9:12:40 AM] Donk: you could def tell that the majority of people in the theater had seen the room
[12/14/17, 9:12:41 AM] Brian Katz: No even if you don‚Äôt know the room the movie is still funny
[12/14/17, 9:13:12 AM] Donk: i agree that you can still like it without having seen the room, but i think it takes away a ton of the nuance and all of the little send ups
[12/14/17, 9:13:57 AM] Brian Katz: For sure
[12/14/17, 12:34:54 PM] Justin: https://news.vice.com/story/jeff-sessions-accidentally-narced-on-his-secret-anti-weed-meeting
[12/14/17, 12:38:33 PM] Donk: they probably were sitting aroudn drinking a scotch while having this meeting
[12/14/17, 12:51:23 PM] Justin: Wow this rep congressmen farenhold is stepping down from reelection and is profoundly sorry. He said such terrible shit CNN had to censor it....what did he say?....he told his aide "he should make sure before his wedding that Saturday that his wife blow him, because it will be his last blow job"....also said "you know your wife can't be wearing white".  Apprently called his aides fucktards a lot.
[12/14/17, 12:52:27 PM] Justin: Media is a bunch of fucktards.
[12/14/17, 1:21:35 PM] Miller: FCC VOTES TO REPEAL NET NEUTRALITY RULES IN 3-2 VOTE (AS EXPECTED)
[12/14/17, 1:22:49 PM] Justin: Fucktards
[12/14/17, 1:27:46 PM] Launchpad: not a single person supports that ban
[12/14/17, 1:28:19 PM] Launchpad: its retarded -- people are paying for bandwidth at the end of the day, not content
[12/14/17, 1:29:01 PM] Launchpad: if netflix is using up an exorbitant amount of bandwidth, shouldn't make a difference
[12/14/17, 1:30:06 PM] Launchpad: but companies like comcast are going to argue that it would make a diffence to the consumer -- whats going to happen is comcast will charge Netflix more to traffic their data, and Netflix will raise their rates
[12/14/17, 1:30:26 PM] Launchpad: **comcast will argue it WONT make a difference to the consumer
[12/14/17, 1:31:26 PM] Justin: Like I said. Literally only topic all Americans agree on
[12/14/17, 1:31:47 PM] Justin: Hate that smug fuck Indian
[12/14/17, 1:32:27 PM] Justin: Don't forget crush competition
[12/14/17, 1:33:47 PM] Justin: Why should Netflix pay millions to improve its algorithm when it couldnjust pay Comcast to slow down competition.
[12/14/17, 4:49:45 PM] Scott: https://www.facebook.com/justinblakegoodman/posts/10104029070023355
[12/14/17, 4:50:25 PM] Launchpad: why is that important that hes Indian?
[12/14/17, 6:01:33 PM] Justin: Simply filled in a noun becuase I don't know his name. Could have used another expletive
[12/14/17, 6:26:59 PM] Justin: https://cointelegraph.com/news/senior-vp-says-ebay-seriously-considering-bitcoin-integration

[12/14/17, 6:29:21 PM] Justin: im good
[12/14/17, 6:29:48 PM] Justin: maybe in late 2018 when its at 1k and blockchain actually starts producing
[12/14/17, 6:30:35 PM] Justin: but probably wont choose bitcoin at that point either, maybe etherium or something else
[12/14/17, 6:31:36 PM] Launchpad: you do know you don't have to put all your eggs in one basket

[12/15/17, 8:55:31 AM] Miller: company holiday party last night, our receptionist (22 year old BU grad, donated $ to bernie) asked us about bitcoin, which she thought was traded on the stock market
[12/15/17, 8:55:56 AM] Miller: a couple ppl basically said why not take $1000 and see what happens
[12/15/17, 8:57:13 AM] Miller: im still out, even if i invested $1k and it went up TWENTY TIMES to 300k or w/e like okay great its a great ROI but 20k (less after taxes) isnt really going to change my life, im not retiring
[12/15/17, 8:57:39 AM] Miller: then they suggested it made sense for kids where yes obviously if you were young 20k would be sick but what kid has $1k to "throw away"
[12/15/17, 8:57:48 AM] Miller: i had like $14 in savings at my peak when i was a kid
[12/15/17, 8:58:38 AM] Donk: you could have turned that 14.00 in to 280.00!
[12/15/17, 8:58:54 AM] Miller: missed opportunity
[12/15/17, 8:58:58 AM] Donk: thats like 4 video games
[12/15/17, 8:59:17 AM] Miller: although the ROI on my bar mitzah money in just the regular stock market from 13 y/o to like 28 or w/e was insane

[12/15/17, 9:10:12 AM] Kiyoon: I have to imagine that's a top 5 website
[12/15/17, 9:10:31 AM] Donk: ha, quite possibly
[12/15/17, 9:10:54 AM] Scott: Why imagine and not just Google it,

[12/15/17, 10:04:34 AM] Donk: which btw, going back to the orignial conversation on the album, has had way more airplay and has had way more longevity then that drake album
[12/15/17, 10:05:03 AM] Brian Katz: Drake‚Äôs whack. That will be all.
[12/15/17, 10:07:48 AM] Miller: air play yes
[12/15/17, 10:07:53 AM] Miller: i have not listened to it since it came out

[12/15/17, 10:10:41 AM] Donk: dont try to use my love of the ringer against me lol
[12/15/17, 10:10:50 AM] Donk: but yeah, i think its crazy that its number 1 on their list
[12/15/17, 10:11:09 AM] Donk: tbh i think that whole list was crazy
[12/15/17, 10:11:18 AM] Miller: certainly my most listened to album this year
[12/15/17, 10:12:33 AM] Donk: im not sure what mine was
[12/15/17, 10:13:02 AM] Donk: the new lcd soundsytem album was probably it
[12/15/17, 10:13:05 AM] Miller: phish - phish phood
[12/15/17, 10:13:09 AM] Miller: close enough tbh
[12/15/17, 10:13:32 AM] Donk: phish and lcd are nothing alike lol
[12/15/17, 10:13:42 AM] Donk: and no one actually listens to phish studio albums
[12/15/17, 10:13:43 AM] Miller: both something im not fucking with
[12/15/17, 10:13:50 AM] Donk: its all about live recordings
[12/15/17, 10:14:35 AM] Donk: im seeing LCD tonight actually at Brooklyn Steel

[12/15/17, 11:48:16 AM] Justin: But yeh I'd be down to pay into a collective over paying Comcast/Verizon.
[12/15/17, 11:50:44 AM] Donk: this whole dog and pony show trump did yesterday talking about how he is the biggest cutter of red tape, and then actually put together a whole prop of paper and a red tape and then literally cut it is so ridiuclous

[12/15/17, 11:55:42 AM] Miller: i think i saw IBKR is now allowing sorting of BTC but they want 40k in margin
[12/15/17, 11:56:25 AM] Launchpad: cause you'd have to be insane to want to short btc
[12/15/17, 11:58:44 AM] Launchpad: when your firm decides they want to hire a crypto guy send them my contact info

[12/15/17, 12:01:38 PM] Justin: Fberg coming

[12/15/17, 12:02:44 PM] Dan Watts: Hipster comment of 2017. Move to Brooklyn Donk
[12/15/17, 12:03:39 PM] Donk: nah, the hipster comment would have been saying that Run the Jewels 3 was better than 4:44
[12/15/17, 12:03:45 PM] Donk: (and it may have been lol)
[12/15/17, 12:04:48 PM] Dan Watts: I thought 4:44 was a masterpiece
[12/15/17, 12:05:29 PM] Donk: IMO it is a good album, but thats it
[12/15/17, 12:07:17 PM] Donk: and like the 8th best Jay album if we are being honest
[12/15/17, 12:09:55 PM] Scott: how do we feel about the song "river" on new em album ft "the homie" ed sheeran?
[12/15/17, 12:11:49 PM] Miller: top 4 jay album
[12/15/17, 12:12:33 PM] Donk: thats crazy talk
[12/15/17, 12:12:55 PM] Scott: Such an arrogant opinion.
[12/15/17, 12:13:18 PM] Donk: you putting above any of reasonable doubt, blueprint, watch the throne, black album? not to mention bp2, vol 2, maybe even bp3?
[12/15/17, 12:13:45 PM] Donk: dont hurt yourself cheese, have a seat before you fall down
[12/15/17, 12:14:13 PM] Scott: i'm seated already.
[12/15/17, 12:19:16 PM] Miller: WTT is not a jayz album
[12/15/17, 12:19:28 PM] Miller: top 4 easily RD BP TBA 444
[12/15/17, 12:19:33 PM] Miller: in no order
[12/15/17, 12:21:14 PM] Donk: WTT def counts as a jay album imo

[12/15/17, 1:23:59 PM] Justin: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qUEy55r49fY ....he told you so
[12/15/17, 1:28:37 PM] Justin: But thats a pretty strong example of a survey that is not well done.
[12/15/17, 1:30:17 PM] Justin: Although I wonder how close the 6% number is to the reality.
[12/15/17, 1:31:30 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/15/17, 1:32:44 PM] Justin: The conclusion is different because likely there classification(which is done by the survey),is in fact wrong.  Which anyone with half a brain would understand when you look at the 26% number.

[12/15/17, 5:52:46 PM] Justin: Lol yeh
[12/15/17, 5:53:05 PM] Miller: Apparently people said they searched their names and names of dead relatives and there were comments from them

[12/20/17, 3:47:29 PM] Launchpad: how does it bankrupt America?
[12/20/17, 3:47:43 PM] Justin: By adding trillions of dollars to deficit?
[12/20/17, 3:47:48 PM] Miller: 2.2T
[12/20/17, 3:48:04 PM] Justin: Which will result in cuts far exceeding that 100$ those idiots are bragging about all over red states
[12/20/17, 3:48:03 PM] Launchpad: democrats are concerned about deficits now?
[12/20/17, 3:48:13 PM] Justin: I'm concerned with result
[12/20/17, 3:49:09 PM] Justin: I'd be fine running a massive deficit to actually spend money
[12/20/17, 3:49:50 PM] Launchpad: what if people having cash in their hands encourages them to go out and spend it in the economy
[12/20/17, 3:49:54 PM] Justin: I'm notfine running a massive deficit to give corporation tax cuts to buy back stocks and export more jobs overseas while cutting the social safety net for 200 million people.
[12/20/17, 3:49:54 PM] Donk: giving cuts to corporations and really rich people are going to somehwo make them hire more people and pay out more in salary? come one now
[12/20/17, 3:50:53 PM] Justin: Ok well if that's the case than it didn't save anyone money - if you spend 100$ clearly you didn't save. Maybe I don't understand how saving works though.
[12/20/17, 3:51:14 PM] Justin: Also if that's the case. Give tax rebate like bush did.
[12/20/17, 3:51:35 PM] Justin: Which directly gave several hundred and in the end didn't really simulate the economy.
[12/20/17, 3:52:41 PM] Justin: Also they got rid of child excemptions and those credits expire in 4 years
[12/20/17, 3:54:00 PM] Justin: Or else technically the deficit is 3 trillion not 2 trillion. Clearly whoever wrote your little summary is disingenuous.

[12/20/17, 6:05:44 PM] Justin: Haha
[12/20/17, 6:38:09 PM] Launchpad: Aren't they just leaving cash overseas to avoid taxes in the first place? Wouldn't lowering the tax rate encourage companies to bring money back home??
[12/20/17, 7:13:23 PM] Justin: Maybe like you tell me about bitcoin you should read more than one article and learn why yourself?
[12/20/17, 7:14:32 PM] Justin: Or I could easily just tell you we had a tax holiday in 2004 and net result was stock buybacks and loss of 20000 jobs.

[12/20/17, 7:18:23 PM] Launchpad: nothing else probably happened during that time either
[12/20/17, 7:19:06 PM] Launchpad: And if you know that bringing cash back home will just lead to stock buybacks......wait for it.....why don't you just buy stock?
[12/20/17, 7:20:10 PM] Justin: like i said, maybe just read more
[12/20/17, 7:20:35 PM] Launchpad: Maybe Ill just stop fighting gravity

[12/20/17, 7:29:10 PM] Launchpad: yes there are a lot of bums --> in small concentrated parts of the city

[12/20/17, 7:29:35 PM] Launchpad: but its not like they are on every corner
[12/20/17, 7:29:58 PM] Launchpad: what am I supposed to do? Give them money, food, clothes? Cure their substance addiction?
[12/20/17, 7:30:16 PM] Justin: didnt say you were supposed to do anything
[12/20/17, 7:30:40 PM] Justin: still a clear cause and effect relationshoip of prioritizing stock prices over everything else
[12/20/17, 7:30:56 PM] Launchpad: Look, there is nothing wrong with caring about the world and being compassionate -- its admirable.  But when you let the worlds problems become your problems it cripples you from living your own life --- what does that do?
[12/20/17, 7:31:19 PM] Launchpad: Complaining about everything solves nothing
[12/20/17, 7:31:48 PM] Justin: ill remember those words when they outlaw crypto
[12/20/17, 7:32:13 PM] Launchpad: there you go again -- assuming the worst in everything
[12/20/17, 7:32:16 PM] Launchpad: you're so sure...
[12/20/17, 7:32:33 PM] Justin: nah im just saying you are in fact a hypocrite
[12/20/17, 7:33:00 PM] Launchpad: when they outlaw crypto Ill just take my wallet out of the country then cash out
[12/20/17, 7:33:32 PM] Launchpad: not only will I believe that crypto wont be outlawed, we will probably have a USD coin within 10 years
[12/20/17, 7:34:54 PM] Justin: cool, i bleive we will have a completely restructred tax systems within ten years thats more equitable
[12/20/17, 7:35:09 PM] Justin: are we on the same page now?
[12/20/17, 7:35:18 PM] Launchpad: bitcoin is technology
[12/20/17, 7:35:39 PM] Justin: oh so preductions on technology are ok?
[12/20/17, 7:35:47 PM] Launchpad: suggesting we outlaw technological advancements is lunacy
[12/20/17, 7:36:17 PM] Justin: ok i believe bitcoin will be at 0 ten years form now and blockchain tech will be the hd-dvd of database storage.....
[12/20/17, 7:36:27 PM] Launchpad: why would we outlaw crypto? Do you know how much banks right now are investing in the space?
[12/20/17, 7:36:40 PM] Launchpad: lol good luck
[12/20/17, 7:36:49 PM] Justin: the reason i believe this is competitors with decnetralized systems and master servers can process information much faster and are already in more qidespread usage
[12/20/17, 7:36:59 PM] Launchpad: if only you actually understood crypto better you would absolutely love it
[12/20/17, 7:37:10 PM] Launchpad: if you understood what it can do for democracy
[12/20/17, 7:37:12 PM] Justin: what is the advantage of full decentraliation?
[12/20/17, 7:37:15 PM] Justin: can you tell me
[12/20/17, 7:37:35 PM] Justin: versus nosql or a hadoop
[12/20/17, 7:38:16 PM] Launchpad: BUT, you hate everything.  If you were locked in a jail, you'd criticize the key that unlocks the gate
[12/20/17, 7:38:26 PM] Justin: continue to ignore the question
[12/20/17, 7:39:15 PM] Launchpad: The problem is you think its MY job to convince you.  It wont ever happen
[12/20/17, 7:39:28 PM] Launchpad: how about blockchain based voting
[12/20/17, 7:39:51 PM] Launchpad: where every single vote can be tallied
[12/20/17, 7:39:57 PM] Launchpad: the blockchain is a truth machine
[12/20/17, 7:40:18 PM] Launchpad: no hand counting votes
[12/20/17, 7:40:21 PM] Justin: lol your like a religous zealot who hasnt read the text
[12/20/17, 7:40:49 PM] Launchpad: and you think you're smarter than those who've invested 600 billion in this tech
[12/20/17, 7:40:54 PM] Launchpad: yet you don't even understand it
[12/20/17, 7:41:07 PM] Justin: repreating at nauseum shit that joel osteen tells you doesnt mean you understand your religion
[12/20/17, 7:41:30 PM] Launchpad: no i fucken understood it in 2013 when I started buying and telling everyone else
[12/20/17, 7:41:35 PM] Launchpad: no one listened
[12/20/17, 7:42:08 PM] Justin: well youre really fucken bad at communicating that vision
[12/20/17, 7:42:24 PM] Launchpad: Im a software engineer -- you telling me I don't actually understand blockchain would be like me telling you that you don't understand poker
[12/20/17, 7:42:25 PM] Justin: never once have you given me a sentence or paragrpah grounded in an oh shit moment
[12/20/17, 7:42:53 PM] Launchpad: cause its not my fucken job to come up with the magical words to convince your mind of something
[12/20/17, 7:42:54 PM] Justin: i know not your job to give me oh shit momements blah blah blah
[12/20/17, 7:43:00 PM] Justin: lol didnt see that coming
[12/20/17, 7:43:02 PM] Launchpad: I can urge to to do your own research
[12/20/17, 7:43:24 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/20/17, 7:43:56 PM] Launchpad: blockchains create transparency
[12/20/17, 7:46:29 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/20/17, 7:47:25 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/20/17, 7:49:48 PM] Launchpad: you're right
[12/20/17, 7:49:51 PM] Launchpad: right about everything
[12/20/17, 7:49:54 PM] Launchpad: always right
[12/20/17, 7:49:55 PM] Justin: FYI i dont understand omaha, 7 card stud, nl tournament poker...any the other 50 variants...but sure
[12/20/17, 7:50:35 PM] Launchpad: Im pretty sure you know how they work
[12/20/17, 7:51:19 PM] Justin: some of them i know how many cards you get, most of them i woudlnt even know that
[12/20/17, 7:51:36 PM] Justin: some guy aske dme to play triple draw stud heads up other day----no idea wtf that is
[12/20/17, 7:52:33 PM] Launchpad: Fine, I understand bitcoin, but I have no idea what the fuck Groestlcoin is
[12/20/17, 7:52:38 PM] Justin: i mena there isnt even an agreed upon deifniton of what blockchain is
[12/20/17, 7:53:07 PM] Justin: there are general guidelines, mostly revolving around full decentralization
[12/20/17, 7:53:07 PM] Launchpad: ummmm
[12/20/17, 7:53:53 PM] Launchpad: ok guy
[12/20/17, 7:54:24 PM] Launchpad: there isn't even an agreed upon definition of what poker is
[12/20/17, 7:54:25 PM] Justin: im just saying ive tried to look shitup that ive asked and i cant get answers online
[12/20/17, 7:54:35 PM] Launchpad: I mean there are general guidelines, but there are all these variations
[12/20/17, 7:54:49 PM] Launchpad: you're really not trying that hard
[12/20/17, 7:54:54 PM] Justin: ok so i play nl holdem cash game sprofessionally
[12/20/17, 7:54:57 PM] Launchpad: ask one more question that I couldn't answer
[12/20/17, 7:55:17 PM] Launchpad: ever hear of reddit? quora?
[12/20/17, 7:55:26 PM] Launchpad: you can ask the internet questions too
[12/20/17, 7:57:02 PM] Justin: this was closeest i could find
[12/20/17, 7:57:03 PM] Justin: https://medium.com/@sbmeunier/blockchain-technology-a-very-special-kind-of-distributed-database-e63d00781118
[12/20/17, 7:57:14 PM] Justin: ive asked and looked
[12/20/17, 7:57:22 PM] Justin: well not asked, i dont start quora threads
[12/20/17, 7:58:35 PM] Launchpad: Hadoop clusters are run by a central entity
[12/20/17, 7:58:43 PM] Launchpad: the data is not public
[12/20/17, 7:58:48 PM] Justin: yeh master servers
[12/20/17, 7:59:29 PM] Justin: so my question, in terms of businesses? why full decentralization?
[12/20/17, 8:00:07 PM] Justin: its coepltely ineffective in terms of querying form what ive read
[12/20/17, 8:00:20 PM] Launchpad: were not just going to replace every single database with a blockchain
[12/20/17, 8:00:33 PM] Justin: i get that, which ones are we and why is my question?
[12/20/17, 8:00:41 PM] Launchpad: blockchain is for peer to peer transfer of value
[12/20/17, 8:00:43 PM] Justin: seems like something that should have an asnwer
[12/20/17, 8:00:59 PM] Launchpad: your question is so generic
[12/20/17, 8:01:27 PM] Justin: fair enough, idk enough to ask more specific
[12/20/17, 8:01:43 PM] Launchpad: but you know enough to tell me that I dont know enough
[12/20/17, 8:02:10 PM] Justin: this is how everyone of our coneversations go
[12/20/17, 8:02:15 PM] Justin: i ask question you dont asnwer
[12/20/17, 8:02:16 PM] Launchpad: I will continue to make money like a blissful idiot
[12/20/17, 8:02:22 PM] Justin: you then ask why i didnt look it up....i say i did
[12/20/17, 8:02:28 PM] Justin: you then say why ask me that question
[12/20/17, 8:02:45 PM] Launchpad: decentralization adds transparency and removes middle men from the transfer of value
[12/20/17, 8:02:55 PM] Launchpad: Middle men --> fees
[12/20/17, 8:03:07 PM] Justin: so are we talking more about smart contracts and ethierium with that?
[12/20/17, 8:03:23 PM] Justin: or does bitcoin have some sort of smart contract mechanism as well?
[12/20/17, 8:03:50 PM] Launchpad: someone built a layer on top of bitcoin that allows for smart contracts
[12/20/17, 8:04:05 PM] Justin: and is it as efficent as etheirum?
[12/20/17, 8:04:06 PM] Launchpad: but bitcoin as it is now is not scalable
[12/20/17, 8:04:30 PM] Justin: ive read its not scalable...what does that mena
[12/20/17, 8:04:31 PM] Launchpad: no Etherium isn't that efficient either if Crypto Kitties is clogging the network
[12/20/17, 8:04:49 PM] Justin: as in cant work on large about transactions?
[12/20/17, 8:05:01 PM] Launchpad: it cannot handle all the ongoing transactions without bumping up the fees
[12/20/17, 8:05:20 PM] Justin: ok so thats why bitcoin had mining system and etheirum developed their asset proof system
[12/20/17, 8:05:32 PM] Justin: but neither is working yet essentially you are saying
[12/20/17, 8:05:33 PM] Launchpad: all transactions go into a memory pool, and the miners will pick the ones with highest fees attached first
[12/20/17, 8:05:47 PM] Launchpad: EOS is going to be scalable
[12/20/17, 8:06:34 PM] Launchpad: https://steemit.com/record/@steemitblog/steem-blockchain-breaks-1-000-000-transactions
[12/20/17, 8:08:13 PM] Launchpad: steemit runs on the steem blockchain
[12/20/17, 8:08:16 PM] Justin: at 3$ looks like a dent spot to throw my 300 sitting in my foreign poker account
[12/20/17, 8:08:56 PM] Justin: decent*
[12/20/17, 8:09:25 PM] Justin: see this was helpful...now i just need to figure out how to get the fucken money into my wallet
[12/20/17, 8:13:46 PM] Launchpad: on Steem?
[12/20/17, 8:13:51 PM] Launchpad: go for it
[12/20/17, 8:14:09 PM] Launchpad: Daniel Larimer, the creator, is a genius

[12/21/17, 8:57:16 AM] Miller: i honestly cant tell if this is a joke anymore
[12/21/17, 10:07:54 AM] Launchpad: Riot Inc changed their name to Riot Blockchain Inc and there stock went from like $4 to $34
[12/21/17, 10:08:13 AM] Launchpad: but at least they are a tech company and not an iced tea company
[12/21/17, 10:08:19 AM] Miller: thinking of changing my kids names tbh
[12/21/17, 10:08:37 AM] Dan Watts: Watts Blockchain Law Firm

[12/21/17, 3:22:45 PM] Miller: i mean its definitely fake so...........
[12/21/17, 3:45:38 PM] Miller: lol this chase rewards are beyond dumb, i can redeem them for 1c each for literal cash back or can redeem them for .8c back if i use them to pay for something at amazon
[12/21/17, 3:58:59 PM] Kiyoon: Isn't it usually more expensive to get cash/statement back on any Cc then to get a gift card or pay  for something elsewhere
[12/21/17, 3:59:08 PM] Miller: in theory
[12/21/17, 4:33:10 PM] Justin: Amazon rewards are always the worst somehow.
[12/21/17, 4:33:27 PM] Miller: i mean worse than cash is just beyond dumb
[12/21/17, 4:34:03 PM] Justin: For domestic travel southwest usually pretty solid
[12/21/17, 4:34:21 PM] Justin: And can cancel anytime I think
[12/21/17, 4:34:43 PM] Justin: Understand that's not the point, just throwing it out there
[12/21/17, 4:35:40 PM] ‚ÄéMiller changed this group's icon

[12/22/17, 10:17:00 AM] Launchpad: now we can run btc to 25k
[12/22/17, 10:30:07 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/22/17, 11:54:16 AM] Launchpad: Huge correction in the coin market today....whos ready to grab their sack and buy some coins on sale
[12/22/17, 11:58:48 AM] Donk: so let me ask you a qeustion
[12/22/17, 11:58:54 AM] Donk: when the coins were exploding upwards
[12/22/17, 11:59:01 AM] Donk: you said to grab your sack and buy coins
[12/22/17, 11:59:19 AM] Donk: when the coins are now shedding value, its grab your sack and buy coins
[12/22/17, 11:59:19 AM] Launchpad: did I?
[12/22/17, 11:59:29 AM] Donk: is there ever a time not to grab your sack and buy coins?
[12/22/17, 11:59:40 AM] Donk: thats basically all you have done for the past month no?
[12/22/17, 12:00:39 PM] Launchpad: throughout the entire history of cryptocurrencies, there has never been a bad time to buy -- only days better or worse than today
[12/22/17, 12:01:05 PM] Launchpad: there has also never been a bad time to grab your sack
[12/22/17, 12:01:26 PM] Donk: well buying at near 20k on sunday compared today would have been a bad time, no?
[12/22/17, 12:01:54 PM] Launchpad: time will tell
[12/22/17, 12:02:06 PM] Launchpad: certainly fits the 'worse than today' mantra
[12/22/17, 12:13:08 PM] Miller: throughout history there has never been a bad time to buy the S&P
[12/22/17, 12:15:27 PM] Launchpad: also true
[12/22/17, 12:15:42 PM] Launchpad: and yet so many people are afraid of investing money
[12/22/17, 12:16:48 PM] Brian Katz: If I had one Christmas wish this year, it‚Äôd be to titty fuck Katy perry
[12/22/17, 12:20:57 PM] Miller: yea people, grab your sack and invest an appropriate amount of your income into diversified low cost ETFs
[12/22/17, 12:21:45 PM] Launchpad: when I say buy some coins Im not tell you to invest your whole paycheck
[12/22/17, 12:26:16 PM] Launchpad: and I recommend that too except thats the boring stuff
[12/22/17, 12:26:43 PM] Launchpad: no one wants to talk about the stock that only goes up 13% a year
[12/22/17, 12:26:50 PM] Miller: yea doesnt quite have the same effect
[12/22/17, 12:27:00 PM] Miller: probably dont even need to grab your sack tbh
[12/22/17, 12:27:32 PM] Launchpad: you can adjust the boys as necessary
[12/22/17, 12:41:00 PM] Miller: Michael Novogratz, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Fortress Investment Group LLC macro trader, said he‚Äôs shelving plans to start a cryptocurrency hedge fund and predicted that bitcoin may extend its plunge to $8,000.
"We didn‚Äôt like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we‚Äôre doing," Novogratz said in a phone interview. "I look pretty smart pressing the pause button right now."
[12/22/17, 12:42:02 PM] Kiyoon: Bitcoin cash is at 0
[12/22/17, 12:42:03 PM] Kiyoon: Lolz
[12/22/17, 12:43:18 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/22/17, 12:43:41 PM] Kiyoon: On coinbase it is
[12/22/17, 12:43:55 PM] Kiyoon: I can't take a screenshot of it
[12/22/17, 12:56:27 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/22/17, 12:56:51 PM] Launchpad: @15166335046 do you even know what Bitcoin Cash is?
[12/22/17, 12:57:22 PM] Justin: I mean he posted same price point as you, so seemingly irrelevant?
[12/22/17, 12:57:36 PM] Launchpad: Goldman Sachs really nailed that call just like they nailed the runup from $200 to 20k.  Jamie Dimon too
[12/22/17, 12:59:46 PM] Miller: i dont know what bitcoin cash is, i dont care what bitcoin cash is, i was merely disputing kiyoons assertation that it went to 0
[12/22/17, 12:59:57 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/22/17, 1:00:59 PM] Launchpad: trying to explain bitcoin cash might make @16316620763's head explode
[12/22/17, 1:01:54 PM] Launchpad: the short answer is that its like a bitcoin dividend
[12/22/17, 1:02:15 PM] Justin: Pretty sure no one asked this question
[12/22/17, 1:03:13 PM] Miller: I gave myself Jerry on purpose. Well, I was right in the middle of a sentence, but... what? I gave myself the tapeworm. Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've... How, you're wondering. No, I don't. No, thanks. I bought poop on the dark Web and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight. Jesus Christ. Uh, that's enough. Yeah. Well, it took about four ounces of it. I-I... That's enough! I don't want to know! With the tip of a teaspoon. Okay... Frank! How else? Stop answering questions I'm not asking, okay?
[12/22/17, 1:09:35 PM] James  L: Nice fecal implants are the shit

[12/22/17, 1:10:24 PM] Launchpad: why would I sell my shit

[12/22/17, 1:10:41 PM] Launchpad: Im in the money

[12/22/17, 1:12:57 PM] James  L: Replacing the guy microbiome
[12/22/17, 1:13:00 PM] James  L: Gut
[12/22/17, 1:15:00 PM] Dan Watts: I heard caffeine enemas are popping now too
[12/22/17, 1:16:51 PM] Donk: move over cold brew, there is a new game in town
[12/22/17, 1:31:52 PM] Justin: Always a smart idea to replace the bodies billion year old evolutioniary system we don't understand with some shit called fecal implants.
[12/22/17, 2:03:52 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/22/17, 2:04:01 PM] James  L: Your replacing your shit with someone else healthy shit filled with that billion years old shit
[12/22/17, 2:04:39 PM] Miller: wait what
[12/22/17, 2:04:42 PM] Miller: replace your shit
[12/22/17, 2:04:48 PM] Miller: with someone elses healthy shit
[12/22/17, 2:04:56 PM] Miller: that is filled with billion year old shit?
[12/22/17, 2:05:59 PM] James  L: You got it
[12/22/17, 2:09:11 PM] Launchpad: the alternative is to take investing advice from those who've missed the entire bull market and don't understand it
[12/22/17, 3:53:11 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/22/17, 6:22:03 PM] Justin: Wow you seem really worried and in need of justifying your actions over something you cant change. Stop reading and following these charts walk outside and take a breath of fresh air. There is life to be lived.
[12/22/17, 6:22:34 PM] Launchpad: lmao thanks herman

[12/27/17, 6:06:18 PM] Launchpad: whats your analysis on what bitcoins worth?
[12/27/17, 6:07:13 PM] Justin: No idea. But it can't be any wildly more speculative than what these guys did. Note I'm critical of a bearish projection here
[12/27/17, 6:07:30 PM] Launchpad: the reason it fluctuates so wildly is that no one can agree on what its really worth
[12/27/17, 6:07:58 PM] Launchpad: with a lot of smart people suggesting it can go to 100k or 1 million, and with a reasonable basis for doing so
[12/27/17, 6:08:10 PM] Justin: I get that but saying it's equivalent to 100 dollar bills and than arbitrarily picking to data points on circulation of 100 bills, is not analysis
[12/27/17, 6:08:30 PM] Launchpad: ummm no thats not what it said
[12/27/17, 6:09:01 PM] Justin: 10-33%. It's exactly what it said
[12/27/17, 6:09:32 PM] Justin: It claimed it has similar use value to 100's which isn't a factual statement
[12/27/17, 6:09:56 PM] Justin: And than picked two price points off that ssumption that match up with 6500-23k with no reasoning
[12/27/17, 6:10:00 PM] Launchpad: its saying that bitcoin is being used for the same reasons as those who horde $100 bills, and if it can capture 10% of that market, then this is what its value will be
[12/27/17, 6:11:00 PM] Justin: And that's completely speculative and arbitrary
[12/27/17, 6:11:17 PM] Justin: Like you say it could be worth 200k
[12/27/17, 6:11:24 PM] Launchpad: BTFD
[12/27/17, 6:11:39 PM] Justin: It could also be worth near 0. Who the fuck knows a decent range
[12/27/17, 6:11:57 PM] Justin: How many bitcoins do you own?  How many 100 dollar bills do you own?
[12/27/17, 6:12:55 PM] Launchpad: Visa could be worth near 0
[12/27/17, 6:12:56 PM] Justin: So clearly that's not why you or anyone you know own it, so why imply that is its main purpose. Beyond stupid.
[12/27/17, 6:13:18 PM] Justin: For a second step back and realize I said 0-200k
[12/27/17, 6:14:47 PM] Launchpad: oh yeah hes definitely missing a ton of use cases
[12/27/17, 6:15:09 PM] Justin: My point being making a headline of bitcoin will fall down to 6400 and settle at 14k because of circulation and use purpose of 100$ bills, is dumb. I don't think most people investing in bitcoin think it's acting like 100$ bills
[12/27/17, 6:15:24 PM] Launchpad: "Bitcoin's primary 'real' use case right now is personal asset protection," he wrote. "Yes, that includes money laundering and tax evasion. But it also incorporates the legitimate desire of honest people living in countries with less-than-exemplary rules of law to shield some of their assets.

"At the moment, the primary instrument used globally for these purposes is the $100 bill."
[12/27/17, 6:15:55 PM] Justin: And if he was making your analysis, he would say the floor is 6600 -22k, because clearly there are other uses that add to its value. That's not what he's saying though.
[12/27/17, 6:16:49 PM] Launchpad: Ultimately it will continue to boom as investors realize that crypto is an important asset in a diversified portfolio along with stocks, bonds, real estate & precious metals
[12/27/17, 6:17:21 PM] Justin: I'd rather here him say that
[12/27/17, 6:18:16 PM] Launchpad: I don't know why you would want to get any of your crypto info from CNBC
[12/27/17, 6:18:58 PM] Justin: Probably not much better getting it from coinbase
[12/27/17, 6:19:35 PM] Justin: I thought when I clicked he had done some sort of financial analysis, I was wrong
[12/27/17, 6:19:50 PM] Launchpad: Bitcoin is like the high school girl who suddenly became hot, and now the guys like CNBC who used to make fun of her and call her ugly want to get a piece
[12/27/17, 6:20:19 PM] Launchpad: probably cause coinbase isn't a news site
[12/27/17, 6:21:55 PM] Justin: Coindesk or whatever has a coin in the name.
[12/27/17, 6:20:53 PM] Scott: üò±
[12/27/17, 6:21:52 PM] Launchpad: CNBC is just cheap talking points
[12/27/17, 6:23:48 PM] Launchpad: While coindesk is certainly optimistic and can be guilty of pumping certain things, they have been covering crypto for years and actually are on top of the news & info
[12/27/17, 6:24:04 PM] Launchpad: CNBC crypto is for crypto rookies who don't know shit
[12/27/17, 6:30:11 PM] Launchpad: is your email still jhstv02@yahoo.com
[12/27/17, 6:30:30 PM] Justin: Yeh.
[12/27/17, 6:30:48 PM] Launchpad: just forwarded an article
[12/27/17, 6:33:16 PM] Justin: I mean already ignoring price stability in a major aspect of a currency
[12/27/17, 6:34:08 PM] Justin: I prefer non fluff pieces. I want the gritty details
[12/27/17, 6:35:48 PM] Launchpad: yes bitcoin itself is old, slow & expensive -- it will not be the currency it was at one time hoped to be.  It doesn't scale and it needs a major upgrade.  Instead there will be a basket of digital currencies that people will hold onto for difference reasons.  Its entirely possible that bitcoin cash will take over as the true bitcoin and anyone not hedging could end up really hurt
[12/27/17, 6:37:10 PM] Launchpad: For the record so is Ethereum.  EOS will be taking a lot of its market share when it gets released mid 2018. You heard it hear first
[12/27/17, 6:37:37 PM] Miller: So hedging here just means owning all the different coins?
[12/27/17, 6:38:00 PM] Launchpad: no it means owning an equal amount of bitcoin cash as you own bitcoin

[12/27/17, 6:39:51 PM] Miller: Goddamn snowflake
[12/27/17, 6:40:10 PM] Justin: Idk is t common to use liberal with dose of salt
[12/27/17, 6:40:13 PM] Launchpad: I doubt it was meant as an insult to liberal democrats
[12/27/17, 6:40:14 PM] Justin: Could be
[12/27/17, 6:41:09 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/27/17, 6:41:42 PM] Justin: Idk Google pretty good with this stuff. They even know my search history and that I just typed liberal dose of salt and didn't suggest it
[12/27/17, 6:42:09 PM] Launchpad: I got an idea -- how about you discredit an authors entire body of writing because he "might" have insulted your political affiliation and you don't like it
[12/27/17, 6:43:38 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/27/17, 6:44:01 PM] Justin: I understand what the word liberal means
[12/27/17, 6:44:09 PM] Justin: Hence why I said "pun"
[12/27/17, 6:45:04 PM] Justin: Was just saying. Like you said nothing groundbreaking
[12/27/17, 6:45:09 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/27/17, 6:45:22 PM] Justin: Lol
[12/27/17, 6:45:24 PM] Launchpad: seeing as how this author doesn't write about politics and only about cryptos, you taking that as a 'pun' is perhaps just you being a bit sensitive
[12/27/17, 6:45:26 PM] Launchpad: lol
[12/27/17, 6:46:22 PM] Justin: I'm the opposite of sensitive. And prefaced it with I could be wrong. Strange use case of a word when referring to the "liberal" media in the sentence before.
[12/27/17, 6:47:02 PM] Justin: Irrelevant anyway
[12/27/17, 6:47:19 PM] Launchpad: no he didn't refer to the 'liberal' media, he referred to the 'mainstream' media
[12/27/17, 6:48:27 PM] Justin: Fnn
[12/27/17, 6:48:35 PM] Launchpad: fox news is pretty mainstream but not something I would refer to as liberal
[12/27/17, 6:48:46 PM] Justin: Lol
[12/27/17, 6:48:46 PM] Miller: You seem pretty sensitive to the word
[12/27/17, 6:49:09 PM] Miller: I don't think someone the opposite of sensitive would even have noticed
[12/27/17, 6:49:12 PM] Justin: I do hate it that it's now associated with shitty democrats that are neoliberals.
[12/27/17, 6:49:33 PM] Justin: Make me have to identify as socialist or progressive when I should be able to just identify as liberal
[12/27/17, 6:49:44 PM] Miller: Even worse I can no longer playfully call people cucks without it being political
[12/27/17, 6:49:58 PM] Launchpad: Just another reminder that we don't actually see the world the way it is, but we see the world the way we are
[12/27/17, 6:50:20 PM] Justin: I do carry around my Democratic socialist party of America I'd card in my wallet though.
[12/27/17, 6:50:44 PM] Launchpad: nobody in crypto land is making anyone identify with any political affilitation
[12/27/17, 6:52:06 PM] Justin: You can't possibly believe that
[12/27/17, 6:52:31 PM] Justin: That people in crypto land don't identify themselves w political leanings
[12/27/17, 6:52:58 PM] Justin: I mean it's was formed under a libertarian notion to free money from government.
[12/27/17, 6:53:24 PM] Justin: Most crypto people likely identify as libertarian leaning toward conservative
[12/27/17, 6:53:34 PM] Launchpad: but its not a rule

[12/27/17, 6:55:59 PM] Justin: Screenshot?
[12/27/17, 6:56:06 PM] Launchpad: is that what all white people believe?
[12/27/17, 6:56:09 PM] Justin: Or should say snip tool
[12/27/17, 6:56:50 PM] Justin: All I know is All whites matter
[12/27/17, 6:57:08 PM] Justin: That's only all that counts.
[12/27/17, 6:57:08 PM] Launchpad: you are definitely the most racist person in this chat
[12/27/17, 6:57:45 PM] Justin: It's possible. Not sure what that has to do with white oppression
[12/27/17, 6:58:25 PM] Launchpad: I don't know anybody else who constantly judges, categorizes, & stereotypes individuals based on their race / gender / or opinion on a certain political topic
[12/27/17, 6:58:44 PM] Justin: Well only one of those is racist
[12/27/17, 6:58:51 PM] Justin: So I'm genderist and opinionist
[12/27/17, 6:58:57 PM] Launchpad: and bigot
[12/27/17, 6:59:00 PM] Justin: Probably rhe most of those
[12/27/17, 6:59:57 PM] Justin: I tend to think I view life from a class lense, but maybe I'm wrong.
[12/27/17, 7:00:30 PM] Launchpad: you were ready to discredit the work of a dude whose making people a lot of money because you thought a normal analogy he used 'might' have been a pun at your expense
[12/27/17, 7:00:30 PM] Launchpad: You've judged him as not credible -- have fun on CNBC, all their viewers are millionaires
[12/27/17, 7:00:54 PM] Launchpad: perhaps true
[12/27/17, 7:00:54 PM] Launchpad: you are a classist
[12/27/17, 7:04:20 PM] Justin: If he has a class of work, send me that?
[12/27/17, 7:06:29 PM] Justin: I didn't like that he ignored how price fluctuation makes for terrible currency
[12/27/17, 7:07:23 PM] Justin: How can you claim acceptance is a major factor for a currency and ignore that in order to be widely accepted a currency must be stable and not inherently volatile?
[12/27/17, 7:07:34 PM] Launchpad: "According to investment firm ARK Invest, at the beginning of this year, "bitcoin's daily volatility was about one-fifth that of five years ago, and 28% less than January 1, 2016."
[12/27/17, 7:07:52 PM] Justin: He later addresses this to say just like any asset volatility can be profitable....sure but it undermines the currency use
[12/27/17, 7:08:17 PM] Justin: So like I said fluff piece or disingenuous.
[12/27/17, 7:09:39 PM] Launchpad: its a crypto asset
[12/27/17, 7:09:57 PM] Launchpad: you seem hell bent on the idea that bitcoin can only be a stable currency or its useless
[12/27/17, 7:10:03 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/27/17, 7:10:13 PM] Launchpad: because your mind wants to put things into neatly judgable boxes
[12/27/17, 7:10:22 PM] Justin: It's his argument not mine
[12/27/17, 7:10:24 PM] Launchpad: did he ever say that bitcoin is only a currency and its the best?
[12/27/17, 7:10:38 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/27/17, 7:10:51 PM] Justin: He's calling it a currency.
[12/27/17, 7:11:01 PM] Justin: He's ignoring the volatility becuase the undermines that
[12/27/17, 7:11:18 PM] Justin: He's than addressing t later when it benefits his discussion of bitcoin as an asset
[12/27/17, 7:11:31 PM] Launchpad: ok and he address your point that its too volitile by telling you volitility is down 80% over the last 5 years and is continuing to trend down
[12/27/17, 7:11:36 PM] Launchpad: is that not enough for you?
[12/27/17, 7:12:01 PM] Launchpad: the first iphone didn't have copy & paste -- total failure as a phone if you ask me
[12/27/17, 7:12:41 PM] Launchpad: and you nitpick on the most stupid and frivolous shit and miss the big picture
[12/27/17, 7:13:01 PM] Justin: Volatility is pretty big picture
[12/27/17, 7:13:49 PM] Launchpad: fine, continue to sit on the sidelines and miss out
[12/27/17, 7:14:21 PM] Launchpad: and its also been addressed
[12/27/17, 7:14:42 PM] Launchpad: According to investment firm ARK Invest, at the beginning of this year, "bitcoin's daily volatility was about one-fifth that of five years ago, and 28% less than January 1, 2016."

And this trend should continue as time goes on... and more money flocks into this space.

That said, even with this level of volatility, bitcoin delivered better risk-adjusted returns than stocks, bonds, gold, and real estate over the past five years. In fact, over the past year alone, bitcoin performed twice as well as stocks, on a risk-adjusted basis.
[12/27/17, 7:15:31 PM] Justin: Well aside from wanting to know relative meaning there. I'd also want to know if those price points were deliberate
[12/27/17, 7:17:18 PM] Launchpad: which price points
[12/27/17, 7:17:21 PM] Justin: How volatile was January 1st 2016 restive to other days. How volatile was it 5 years ago versus 3 years ago. Lastly and most important does the volatility still fall outside 2 std deviation of a basket of currencies.
[12/27/17, 7:17:56 PM] Justin: Or commodities
[12/27/17, 7:17:55 PM] Launchpad: "That said, even with this level of volatility, bitcoin delivered better risk-adjusted returns than stocks, bonds, gold, and real estate over the past five years. In fact, over the past year alone, bitcoin performed twice as well as stocks, on a risk-adjusted basis."
[12/27/17, 7:18:06 PM] Justin: Or stocks even. This would be useful
[12/27/17, 7:18:25 PM] Justin: Idk what risk adjusted basis means
[12/27/17, 7:19:16 PM] Launchpad: it means the volatility is factored in
[12/27/17, 7:19:44 PM] Justin: But isn't that obvious considering it's up 5000%
[12/27/17, 7:20:23 PM] Justin: I mean it could be really volatile but it's returns are crushing everything else
[12/27/17, 7:20:37 PM] Launchpad: it means that even though the risk is high, the returns outweigh the risk taken
[12/27/17, 7:20:37 PM] Launchpad: bonds have a much lower risk but also a much lower rate of return
[12/27/17, 7:21:15 PM] Launchpad: yeah and it also means every time you bash it Im laughing inside
[12/27/17, 7:21:26 PM] Justin: Yeh that's fair
[12/27/17, 7:24:03 PM] Launchpad: that also means that after a 5000% gain, I can pull out 2% of my capital and not give a fuck if it goes to 0 cause Ill still be even
[12/27/17, 7:24:35 PM] Launchpad: but those people bash liberals so I better stay away üò≠
[12/27/17, 7:37:04 PM] Justin: Liberals are scary

[12/29/17, 12:58:42 PM] Justin: simply becuase of the idology as oppose ot the action
[12/29/17, 12:59:36 PM] Justin: and at watts i am watching this....not sure why i am watching this
[12/29/17, 1:00:01 PM] Justin: seems like a pretty strong effort to overblow a non existing issue
[12/29/17, 1:00:32 PM] Justin: its not a new phenonmenon that colleges are liberal bastionns brainwashing children and making them weak to the real world
[12/29/17, 1:00:04 PM] Dan Watts: You were shitting on markets
[12/29/17, 1:00:15 PM] Dan Watts: His analysis of markets is reasonable and spot on
[12/29/17, 1:00:23 PM] Dan Watts: Progressive without venturing into communism
[12/29/17, 1:01:02 PM] Justin: but its cool this guy got on joe rogan and made national news becuase of it?
[12/29/17, 1:01:42 PM] Justin: does he say tehir are certain markets that are unfeasable and unworkable?
[12/29/17, 1:02:05 PM] Justin: if so, im on board
[12/29/17, 1:05:03 PM] Dan Watts: Yes
[12/29/17, 1:05:23 PM] Justin: althoguh im liking joe rogans spekaing point on spending money on inner cities instead of war.......brekaing news....thats socialism
[12/29/17, 1:05:30 PM] Launchpad: Of all those people that used to complain about the banks and banking, some decided to get involved with an alternative banking system. The rest are still complaining
[12/29/17, 1:06:24 PM] Launchpad: Is capitalism defined as spending money on war?
[12/29/17, 1:08:08 PM] Launchpad: I used to complain about the banks... now I'm sitting first class drinking flat champagne aka white wine
[12/29/17, 1:09:58 PM] Justin: oh you mean like how because systemically African Americans werent given loans, mortages, or allowed to deposit in fdic protected institutions so they went with community banks with lower interest.  Thus enlarging the wealth gap and making minority communities incapable of starting business ala the american dream.   Meanwhile many of those banks failed wiping out generations of savings in black communities in  the early to mid 1900's, thus setting off the cycle of poverty we see today????? alternate banks like that or you mean bitcoin becuase thats your reality
[12/29/17, 1:10:27 PM] Justin: and btw war is socialism as well
[12/29/17, 1:11:48 PM] Launchpad: Crypto is an alternate banking system
[12/29/17, 1:11:59 PM] Justin: it snot my fault people are incapable of understanding socialism outside the nonsensical definiton of some big bad russia when they are surrounded by it at all times in america
[12/29/17, 1:12:22 PM] Dan Watts: You‚Äôre going to see me tomorrow herm- listen to the whole thing and we can talk about it rather than make a comment about 30 seconds of the video
[12/29/17, 1:12:45 PM] Dan Watts: Actually I probably don‚Äôt want to talk about this at feinbergs wedding nvm
[12/29/17, 1:13:27 PM] Justin: nah i liked rogans point...just saying thats solecism
[12/29/17, 1:13:56 PM] Justin: solecism
[12/29/17, 1:14:13 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/29/17, 1:15:54 PM] Launchpad: Problem is your always fighting for labels. Labels are useful for grouping, but not setting definitions.  Ask 100 people what socialism is, you might get 100 different answers. Then you end up arguing what your label actually means instead of finding solutions to common problems
[12/29/17, 1:16:46 PM] Launchpad: I'm on an airplane so i need as much useless arguments as I can get
[12/29/17, 1:16:52 PM] Justin: black and yellow black and yellow
[12/29/17, 1:17:14 PM] Justin: yeh things are what we think they are
[12/29/17, 1:17:25 PM] Justin: hence bitcoin is at 15k
[12/29/17, 1:17:32 PM] Justin: i understand how dillusions work
[12/29/17, 1:17:33 PM] Launchpad: No things are complicated
[12/29/17, 1:17:46 PM] Launchpad: But you don't understand how math works
[12/29/17, 1:18:00 PM] Launchpad: And that's why bitcoin is at 15k
[12/29/17, 1:18:00 PM] Justin: math is hard 2=2 can  equal 5
[12/29/17, 1:18:08 PM] Justin: 2+2
[12/29/17, 1:18:23 PM] Justin: that would be supply and demand presumably, not math
[12/29/17, 1:18:51 PM] Justin: can understand math and still disagree with pricing mechanisms
[12/29/17, 1:19:32 PM] Launchpad: The only reason the bubble people have for crypto being in a bubble is because of how much it's already gone up
[12/29/17, 1:20:04 PM] Justin: usually that is how bubbles work
[12/29/17, 1:20:18 PM] Justin: doesnt mean that crytpo dont have some value
[12/29/17, 1:20:48 PM] Justin: means that the pricing mechanism driving bitcoin currently , isn't in line with that true value
[12/29/17, 1:21:44 PM] Launchpad: No it's not
[12/29/17, 1:22:35 PM] Launchpad: You can't look at an asset and say its gone up 2000% so therefore its in a bubble
[12/29/17, 1:23:42 PM] Launchpad: But you're right... supply and demand is the main factor... When demand is worldwide, prices can move very quickly
[12/29/17, 1:24:40 PM] Justin: it has many self perpetuating bubble features built into the system
[12/29/17, 1:24:50 PM] Justin: with no regulation and oversight
[12/29/17, 1:25:18 PM] Launchpad: Did regulation and oversight stop the tech and housing bubble?
[12/29/17, 1:25:29 PM] Justin: so its true price will depend on 2 things.... ability of blockchain to produce...2 ability  to operate within regulatory framework
[12/29/17, 1:26:20 PM] Justin: so i think saying its worth 0,2k,20k,200k absent some strong evidence, is a pure guessing game
[12/29/17, 1:26:58 PM] Launchpad: Or maybe it's price and demand is reflected by people like you who got fed up with the current system
[12/29/17, 1:27:03 PM] Justin: but the tech bubble is a great example comparatively
[12/29/17, 1:27:15 PM] Justin: when it was at 800....sure
[12/29/17, 1:27:18 PM] Justin: 2k maybe
[12/29/17, 1:27:38 PM] Justin: when it jumped to 20k and kiyoon was in on the game....very unlikely
[12/29/17, 1:28:20 PM] Justin: people like me fed up with current system, what use value does it have for me?
[12/29/17, 1:28:42 PM] Launchpad: Uber went from 0 to 50 billion in about 4 years. You know you made thousands of percent in profit? A small group of Institutional and accredited investors
[12/29/17, 1:29:13 PM] Justin: but thats not what you just implied
[12/29/17, 1:30:03 PM] Launchpad: Ethereum went from 0 to 50 billion in half that time... toy know who got rich? Average Joes like you and I
[12/29/17, 1:30:21 PM] Justin: you implied it has use value for me...not that its an investment that cna make me rich
[12/29/17, 1:30:48 PM] Launchpad: Store of value outside the banking system
[12/29/17, 1:30:56 PM] Launchpad: P2p banking
[12/29/17, 1:31:37 PM] Launchpad: If bitcoin is too volatile, you can just hold tether
[12/29/17, 1:32:01 PM] Launchpad: Getting rich is a side affect
[12/29/17, 1:32:10 PM] Justin: but you are getting at the point, its value is that its increasing in vlaue
[12/29/17, 1:32:29 PM] Justin: it isnt widely exchangeable as of yet
[12/29/17, 1:33:18 PM] Justin: and if i wanted to store money outside the abnking system i could do it in gold.  The reason i choose bitcoin is becuase it's return is insane..
[12/29/17, 1:33:13 PM] Launchpad: Neither is Apple stock
[12/29/17, 1:33:27 PM] Launchpad: But it still hold value and people want it
[12/29/17, 1:33:54 PM] Justin: yes and now were getting back to what is its value
[12/29/17, 1:33:57 PM] Launchpad: You hate gold too
[12/29/17, 1:34:23 PM] Justin: id say tis value lays in the success of the thousands of blockchain companies that have opened, wuite like the .com era
[12/29/17, 1:34:22 PM] Launchpad: What is visas value?
[12/29/17, 1:34:51 PM] Justin: the fact it provides billions of dolalrs in credit and instant transactions along side fraud protection?
[12/29/17, 1:35:31 PM] Justin: i mean if bitcoin could do that with lower fees, yeh it could be worth 200k
[12/29/17, 1:36:58 PM] Justin: but why wouldnt visa just make its own blockchain?
[12/29/17, 1:37:22 PM] Justin: buy the first bc company that solves scaling issues?
[12/29/17, 1:37:29 PM] Launchpad: EOS will be able to handle thousands of transactions per second with no fees
[12/29/17, 1:37:52 PM] Launchpad: Already plenty that have solved it
[12/29/17, 1:39:31 PM] Justin: and if EOS doesnt solve it?
[12/29/17, 1:39:39 PM] Launchpad: Bitcoin not being scalable isn't because the tech isnt possible, its because there is no sort of governance built into their blockchain model and therefore upgrades are very slow and political
[12/29/17, 1:40:36 PM] Launchpad: It's already been solved by the developer who created it on another project
[12/29/17, 1:42:45 PM] Launchpad: Holding EOS token earns you bandwidth to use the network
[12/29/17, 1:44:01 PM] Justin: yeh im not gonna pretend i understand how proof of stake etc works...
[12/29/17, 1:44:22 PM] Justin: still odont even undestand how miners put thru bitcoin transactions
[12/29/17, 1:44:47 PM] Launchpad: Ironic considering youll argue for hours against it
[12/29/17, 1:45:10 PM] Justin: wise man and all
[12/29/17, 1:45:39 PM] Brian Katz: Is terrible
[12/29/17, 1:45:56 PM] Launchpad: So basically you don't understand the underlying economics yet you think your opinion holds value?
[12/29/17, 1:46:09 PM] Brian Katz: Get a stylist
[12/29/17, 1:46:39 PM] Launchpad: That's the common denominator of almost everyone who thinks btc is a bubble - they don't understand it
[12/29/17, 1:47:22 PM] Justin: i understand proof of stake would require proof of investment by miners which some people argue will lead to a  less "free" system
[12/29/17, 1:47:39 PM] Justin: i dont understnad why freedom matters in any literal context
[12/29/17, 1:47:53 PM] Launchpad: So basically you don't understand it at all
[12/29/17, 1:48:06 PM] Justin: i mean is the above untrue?
[12/29/17, 1:48:40 PM] Launchpad: I would say its very convoluted
[12/29/17, 1:49:04 PM] Justin: funny becuase thats how i feel
[12/29/17, 1:49:05 PM] Launchpad: Proof of Work btw is dying
[12/29/17, 1:49:23 PM] Launchpad: POW is not economical
[12/29/17, 1:49:35 PM] Justin: so why is bitcoin worth 20k?
[12/29/17, 1:50:08 PM] Launchpad: Because the supply is tiny and the demand is huge
[12/29/17, 1:50:41 PM] Launchpad: And for the time being, btc can hide the expense of POW through inflation
[12/29/17, 1:50:46 PM] Justin: why is the demand huge?
[12/29/17, 1:51:06 PM] Launchpad: 7 billion people on the planet
[12/29/17, 1:51:22 PM] Launchpad: Many are fed up with govt and banks
[12/29/17, 1:51:23 PM] Brian Katz: They all wanna bit coin
[12/29/17, 1:51:44 PM] Justin: if people were educated like scott schecter, woudln't they know that pow is dying and not be investing in bitcoin's proof of work system?
[12/29/17, 1:52:09 PM] Launchpad: Yeah its called diversifying
[12/29/17, 1:53:45 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/29/17, 1:55:52 PM] Launchpad: Its why Ethereum will also collapse unless it's upgraded in time
[12/29/17, 1:56:21 PM] Launchpad: POW and not scalable to meet the world's demand
[12/29/17, 1:56:41 PM] Launchpad: Unlike EOS which wad designed with cost and performance in mind
[12/29/17, 1:58:46 PM] Justin: everyone is feeling this
[12/29/17, 1:58:53 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/29/17, 1:59:25 PM] Justin: lets get back to this... you really sitting first class with champagne.....proof of picture
[12/29/17, 1:59:41 PM] Justin: i need POP
[12/29/17, 1:59:43 PM] Launchpad: They will in 2018 when the rest of the world starts using better platforms for their ICOs
[12/29/17, 2:00:01 PM] Donk: kinda surprised that you'd spring for first class
[12/29/17, 2:00:30 PM] Justin: yeh im calling him out....need to see proof of new launchpad
[12/29/17, 2:00:30 PM] Launchpad: $100 at the gate
[12/29/17, 2:00:51 PM] Donk: ah ok, thats very reasonable
[12/29/17, 2:01:02 PM] Donk: esp for a 5+ hour flight

[1/4/18, 5:55:36 PM] Tk: ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£.. Mills, you don't have luck dealing with snowstorms
[1/4/18, 5:57:16 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/4/18, 5:59:04 PM] Donk: Finally just got power back
[1/4/18, 5:59:16 PM] Donk: üôå
[1/4/18, 5:59:31 PM] Miller: It's lit
[1/4/18, 6:00:16 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/4/18, 6:44:17 PM] James  L: Very true
[1/4/18, 6:45:03 PM] James  L: Get called gay focker at least once a month but then hit them with haldol and Ativan so all is good
[1/4/18, 6:52:58 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/4/18, 6:53:15 PM] Launchpad: people still tell me Scotty doesn't know
[1/4/18, 6:53:30 PM] Launchpad: all the time
[1/4/18, 7:00:36 PM] Brian Katz: But it has nothing to do with the movie eurotrip
[1/4/18, 8:03:09 PM] Brian Katz: Sorry to hear about your car scotty
[1/4/18, 8:03:13 PM] Brian Katz: Cat*
[1/4/18, 8:08:26 PM] Launchpad: thanks bro
[1/4/18, 8:08:32 PM] Launchpad: theres still hope, its not even been 2 days
[1/4/18, 8:09:30 PM] Brian Katz: If the pound picks up the cat, does it have a collar on it to contact you?
[1/4/18, 8:10:06 PM] Launchpad: no that tag fell off but it has a collar on it so it doesn't look like a stray
[1/4/18, 8:10:34 PM] Launchpad: so hopefully hes wondering the neighborhood and not some random out of place area
[1/4/18, 8:11:14 PM] Launchpad: but hes afraid of cars and traffic and probably went someplace quiet like a nice little sun patch in someones backyard
[1/4/18, 8:28:00 PM] Miller: What happened? Baxter is missing?
[1/4/18, 8:28:49 PM] Launchpad: yeah
[1/4/18, 8:29:07 PM] Miller: That sucks, sorry to hear it
[1/4/18, 8:29:08 PM] Launchpad: literally got out the yard 5 minutes before I walked in the door from NY
[1/4/18, 8:29:37 PM] Miller: If you end up needing a new cat I got you
[1/4/18, 8:29:46 PM] Launchpad: lol thanks
[1/4/18, 8:30:40 PM] Miller: Considering the circumstances I'm of course going to have to lower my offer to $500
[1/4/18, 8:32:16 PM] Dan Watts: Sorry Scotty
[1/4/18, 8:32:21 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[1/4/18, 8:37:45 PM] Dan Watts: @16195657200 was bonding like crazy with @15166335046 cat
[1/4/18, 8:41:27 PM] Justin: 1k
[1/4/18, 8:43:12 PM] Brian Katz: Maybe he was on a journey to find you, like in some Pixar movie
[1/4/18, 9:15:06 PM] Scott: Lol
[1/4/18, 10:05:23 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/4/18, 10:05:46 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/4/18, 10:07:30 PM] Justin: looks kinda like billy bob thorton and bryan cranston
[1/4/18, 10:29:15 PM] Scott: Lol
[1/5/18, 7:57:37 AM] Tk: Launchpad, I just saw the news about your cat. Sorry to hear about that n hope you find him. Keep us updated.
[1/5/18, 8:15:19 AM] Sean: Yeah man good luck.
[1/5/18, 9:11:42 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/5/18, 9:13:13 AM] Brian Katz: I want the all fighting gorilla channel too.
[1/5/18, 9:13:43 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/5/18, 9:14:04 AM] Launchpad: 53 hours later...
[1/5/18, 9:14:06 AM] Brian Katz: Damn he almost made it
[1/5/18, 9:14:14 AM] Launchpad: hahaha
[1/5/18, 9:14:25 AM] Brian Katz: Lol I‚Äôm glad you got your kitty back
[1/5/18, 9:15:11 AM] Launchpad: I shit you not I was literally in a bathroom poking holes into a bag of piss -- trying any kind of voodoo the internet would suggest
[1/5/18, 9:15:24 AM] Launchpad: and he just strolls right in like nothing was wrong
[1/5/18, 9:15:35 AM] Launchpad: 48 hours later than expected
[1/5/18, 9:15:42 AM] Donk: wait what?
[1/5/18, 9:15:48 AM] Donk: poking holes in a bag of piss?
[1/5/18, 9:15:58 AM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[1/5/18, 9:16:08 AM] Brian Katz: Scotty was making women attracting fermions
[1/5/18, 9:16:10 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/5/18, 9:16:56 AM] Donk: lol
[1/5/18, 9:17:11 AM] Donk: im not sure if the cat came back because of the piss bags lol
[1/5/18, 9:17:29 AM] Kiyoon: I'm not gonna lie, that makes sense in my mind
[1/5/18, 9:17:31 AM] Launchpad: it makes sense - he always wants to hang out when Im in the bathroom
[1/5/18, 9:18:02 AM] Kiyoon: yeah and a lot of cat owners have the litter and all in the bathroom
[1/5/18, 9:18:18 AM] Miller: well thats insane
[1/5/18, 9:18:29 AM] Donk: cats are weird
[1/5/18, 9:18:41 AM] Sean: üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª
[1/5/18, 9:19:14 AM] Miller: glad he came back though, not sure i would credit the piss bag solution, although i have no doubt piss bag guy will take credit for it
[1/5/18, 9:20:20 AM] Tk: Awesome news LP!
[1/5/18, 9:20:34 AM] Launchpad: thanks guys, really stoked
[1/5/18, 9:20:51 AM] Launchpad: and of course hes just chillen now like nothing happened
[1/5/18, 9:21:29 AM] Launchpad: went right over to my unpacked suitcase and plopped himself down on my stuff
[1/5/18, 9:24:55 AM] Tk: You shiuld invest in  one of those gps tags on him.
[1/5/18, 9:25:20 AM] Miller: or get him an iphone, then you can just do the find my phone thing
[1/5/18, 9:25:21 AM] Tk: If he left once, he will be attempting to do it again.
[1/5/18, 9:25:34 AM] Miller: and if hes just chilling he can just text you and be like im fine, ill be home later
[1/5/18, 9:25:42 AM] Tk: üòÅüòÅüòÅ
[1/5/18, 9:26:10 AM] Tk: Mills, how bad is this storm hitting LI?
[1/5/18, 9:27:06 AM] Miller: it was pretty bad by me, roads are much better today, but the wind was nuts, snow was up to my thigh in spots
[1/5/18, 9:29:14 AM] Tk: Wow! Here,  not much snow, barely an inch but it's freezing. Wind is 20-30mph for the next 24hrs.
[1/5/18, 9:30:28 AM] Launchpad: its good to know that he can handle himself outside and make it back though
[1/5/18, 9:31:17 AM] Launchpad: I did go out and piss outside at 3am and shook some treats so maybe it did work
[1/5/18, 11:24:45 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/5/18, 11:25:05 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/5/18, 11:30:50 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q19qRUBj-ic
[1/5/18, 12:46:52 PM] Brian Katz: The mets are targeting mike moustakas. Sounds like the Mets are looking to make a big signing.
[1/5/18, 12:48:44 PM] Miller: yea ive been saying for months the mets are a mike moustakas away from a world series
[1/5/18, 12:49:12 PM] Miller: its weird that hes willing to play for free but w/e, good for him i guess
[1/5/18, 1:04:54 PM] Brian Katz: Did you guys realize that midgets inhale farts all day?
[1/5/18, 1:05:51 PM] Donk: like referees at a basketball game?
[1/5/18, 1:06:13 PM] Brian Katz: Pretty much
[1/5/18, 1:06:43 PM] Brian Katz: And you know those nba guys are letting them rip when they go to dunk
[1/5/18, 1:40:31 PM] Justin: Maybe Baxter was just like fuck this guy. He left me for four days and it sucked, let's let him sweat a little.
[1/5/18, 1:41:16 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/5/18, 1:41:28 PM] Miller: could have been worse
[1/5/18, 1:42:01 PM] Launchpad: lol was thinking something similar
[1/5/18, 1:42:09 PM] Launchpad: "if you can leave for days I can leave for days"
[1/5/18, 2:12:12 PM] Miller: @16318489683 @16072459839 as per our discussion about recognizing NFL players https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvuj7-xspns&feature=youtu.be
[1/5/18, 2:16:49 PM] Donk: while not involved in that conversation, i would say that outside of a few big stars, they could pretty much all be anonymous
[1/5/18, 2:18:26 PM] Miller: i think it started by someone asking me which NFL players would make me stop in the street and me saying i probably wouldnt recognize like any of them outside eli or brady or something
[1/5/18, 2:20:43 PM] Donk: especially if you eliminated giants as well
[1/5/18, 2:20:50 PM] Donk: i would recongize a good portion of them
[1/5/18, 2:21:21 PM] Donk: but pretty much any defensiveplayer or olineman on another team? no chance
[1/5/18, 2:21:57 PM] Donk: and a good portion of other teams skill position players as well
[1/5/18, 2:50:53 PM] Launchpad: Weed stocks all green, blowing smoke right back in Sessions face
[1/5/18, 3:44:16 PM] Justin: Poker nerds, a community which loves bitcoin, are in outrage over this new draft kings bitcoin tournament
[1/5/18, 3:44:44 PM] Justin: Dk givin away 3 bitcoins prize pool. 3$ buy in and there is no cap on players
[1/5/18, 3:45:00 PM] Justin: Already up at like 20k ppl
[1/5/18, 3:45:03 PM] Miller: the outrage is bc the rake is insane on it
[1/5/18, 3:45:09 PM] Justin: Yeh
[1/5/18, 3:45:26 PM] Justin: Which most people would never understand
[1/5/18, 3:45:26 PM] Miller: just using zOMG BITCOIN to pull the wool over everyones head
[1/5/18, 3:47:15 PM] Justin: Yeh pretty incredible. Also terrible for fantasy environment
[1/5/18, 3:47:42 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/5/18, 3:47:49 PM] Launchpad: why terrible for fantasy environment
[1/5/18, 3:47:51 PM] Justin: Just taking 100k out of draftkings and into something that can't be used to deposit into dk
[1/5/18, 3:48:55 PM] Launchpad: you care way too much about why other people want btc and its volitility
[1/5/18, 3:49:15 PM] Launchpad: like you could have been playing poker with btc in NY instead of moving to NJ
[1/5/18, 3:50:15 PM] Launchpad: Gee...now why would a bunch of GAMBLERs want a volatile asset that's made thousands of people rich
[1/5/18, 3:50:32 PM] Justin: You care way to much about bitcoin, it's a rake co versation.
[1/5/18, 3:50:45 PM] Justin: And gamblers want none of this because it's terrible value tournament
[1/5/18, 3:50:57 PM] Launchpad: lol i guess
[1/5/18, 3:53:10 PM] Justin: And it's bad for environment. If dk allowed bitcoin deposit it still suck but at least not as much.
[1/5/18, 3:53:33 PM] Justin: And you know dk gonna start rolling these out bc it's making an insane amount of rake
[1/5/18, 3:53:57 PM] Justin: Actually Technically it's fanduel I think?
[1/5/18, 3:54:46 PM] Miller: it is fanduel
[1/5/18, 3:58:32 PM] Justin: Doesn't bother me overall, I don't think games are all that profitable to start.
[1/5/18, 3:59:05 PM] Launchpad: Provably fair, decentralized gambling is a big blockchain use case
[1/5/18, 3:59:08 PM] Justin: Maybe variance is just insane when playing football
[1/5/18, 4:00:06 PM] Justin: Yeh some company opened an ico couple months ago. Kinda negative reception though
[1/5/18, 4:01:12 PM] Justin: https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/ann-ico-coinpoker-poker-future-today-1694786/
[1/5/18, 4:04:51 PM] Launchpad: I know they arent the only ones interested in the gambling space  -- I just dont think a single entity has taken over that market but I bet at some point there will be a winner
[1/5/18, 4:07:20 PM] Justin: Self policing could be an issue
[1/5/18, 4:07:56 PM] Justin: Not that sites actually enforce fair game rules like they claim they do
[1/5/18, 4:08:36 PM] Justin: In terms of transactions most world base sites accept crypto
[1/5/18, 6:29:36 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/5/18, 6:32:55 PM] Launchpad: üòÇüòÇ
[1/5/18, 6:34:11 PM] Launchpad: I know why...
[1/5/18, 6:38:22 PM] Brian Katz: Well.....we‚Äôre waiting
[1/5/18, 6:38:50 PM] Launchpad: Who took that picture?
[1/5/18, 6:39:07 PM] Brian Katz: Some guy at the wedding
[1/5/18, 6:42:15 PM] Launchpad: @19732079889 can tell you
[1/5/18, 6:42:42 PM] Brian Katz: Donk? Why is scotty looking directly at the camera!
[1/5/18, 7:00:58 PM] Donk: I honestly dont remember lol
[1/5/18, 7:09:14 PM] Miller: @19732079889 can't tell you
[1/5/18, 7:22:42 PM] Launchpad: someone was sitting in that direction
[1/5/18, 7:23:00 PM] Donk: Oh haha!
[1/5/18, 7:23:13 PM] Donk: She was probably the one taking the photo lol
[1/5/18, 7:23:23 PM] Donk: You got caught on camera haha
[1/5/18, 7:29:10 PM] Miller: Who were you grilling?
[1/5/18, 7:29:24 PM] Scott: More like mean muggin
[1/5/18, 7:29:40 PM] Launchpad: The Feinbergs were also walking by already so dont think I felt the need twist my neck just to watch a bunch of elbows go by
[1/5/18, 7:30:08 PM] Launchpad: double coincidence
[1/5/18, 7:30:08 PM] Scott: Pointy ones too...7/10 at best.
[1/5/18, 7:31:12 PM] Launchpad: Its like I got caught making the 'casual glance' and now it looks like a lurker stare
[1/5/18, 7:33:09 PM] Scott: A/k/a the lp look.

[1/6/18, 12:51:04 AM] Miller: Was a joke btw in case anyone believed it
[1/6/18, 8:58:43 AM] Dan Watts: I believed it and sent it to a guy I used to work for who sends me an anti trump email every day
[1/6/18, 11:00:31 AM] Kiyoon: I believed it as well
[1/6/18, 11:01:10 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/6/18, 11:01:18 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/6/18, 11:02:32 AM] Kiyoon: That's real news
[1/6/18, 11:02:37 AM] Miller: It is
[1/6/18, 11:02:54 AM] Kiyoon: Like, really smart
[1/6/18, 11:03:30 AM] Miller: Every time I see the word gorilla I think of the Francesa Harambe rant, it's so good and he also pronounces gorilla as goriller
[1/6/18, 11:03:34 AM] Miller: https://youtu.be/fFa1L6PSgg8
[1/6/18, 11:03:41 AM] Dan Watts: Trump has really taken advantage of that character limit extension
[1/6/18, 11:11:33 AM] Dan Watts: Mike Francesa understands primate biology
[1/6/18, 11:12:07 AM] Miller: These idiots are worried about the goriller
[1/6/18, 11:14:28 AM] Miller: Atlanta‚Äôs‚Äù sophomore season, which is being titled ‚ÄúAtlanta Robbin‚Äô Season,‚Äù will premiere Thursday, March 1 at 10pm.
[1/6/18, 11:14:55 AM] Miller: If you haven't seen it, watch season 1, one of the best shows on TV

[1/6/18, 3:07:18 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/6/18, 3:10:55 PM] Justin: is that an all the men in the room laughing joke or an attempt to blow up steve for staring down that girl?
[1/6/18, 3:11:20 PM] Miller: Neither
[1/6/18, 3:11:32 PM] Miller: Just found it on Facebook, figured I'd share
[1/6/18, 3:12:23 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/6/18, 3:12:24 PM] Justin: but yeh 50k to tournament 50 k to fanduel....100k comes off of the fanduel community
[1/6/18, 3:13:14 PM] Miller: Good work if you can get it
[1/6/18, 3:13:32 PM] Justin: im gonna guess it was a dance off but i still like the out of context implication
[1/6/18, 3:17:41 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/6/18, 3:22:08 PM] Justin: people are so dumb
[1/6/18, 3:22:40 PM] Miller: Playing in that contest is owning the libs tho
[1/6/18, 3:23:21 PM] Justin: if they keep running these wonder if you could figure out how soft DFS field really is
[1/6/18, 3:24:04 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/6/18, 3:24:19 PM] Justin: id say it has a unique value to it that is desirable, but its not like if you win this tournament you dont have to setup a wallet and do everything you could just do on your own
[1/6/18, 3:24:54 PM] Justin: haha well done
[1/7/18, 12:21:07 AM] Miller: https://youtu.be/lpktyg_0YXM

[1/7/18, 12:21:16 AM] Miller: THE
[1/7/18, 12:21:19 AM] Miller: FUCK
[1/7/18, 12:27:26 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs gross and weird
[1/7/18, 12:27:59 AM] Miller: It's *insane*
[1/7/18, 12:28:08 AM] Miller: Who came up with this idea?
[1/7/18, 12:28:16 AM] Miller: Why would the parents agree?
[1/7/18, 12:28:49 AM] Brian Katz: Weirdos
[1/7/18, 12:29:05 AM] Brian Katz: First question I‚Äôd ask would be why?
[1/7/18, 12:30:25 AM] Miller: Like it actually could have been a funny prank if they had these guys make out with chicks and then just put the parents there when they took the blindfolds off
[1/7/18, 12:30:47 AM] Brian Katz: My bad
[1/7/18, 8:00:14 AM] Scott: That is horrendous
[1/7/18, 9:47:26 AM] Brian Katz: Things said by women after sex with Cheese
[1/7/18, 4:49:28 PM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/7/18, 4:58:48 PM] Scott: Can't hold him back for too long.

[1/7/18, 8:57:29 PM] Justin: the interest is so great that he delayed it?
[1/7/18, 11:02:45 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/7/18, 11:06:39 PM] Miller: It's such a joke
[1/7/18, 11:06:52 PM] Miller: Oh his visor hit his eye
[1/7/18, 11:07:00 PM] Miller: He collapsed walking off the field
[1/7/18, 11:08:35 PM] Miller: 60 degrees next Saturday? Lol this weather is fucking nuts
[1/7/18, 11:38:08 PM] Brian Katz: 60 degrees here?
[1/8/18, 9:17:13 AM] Donk: anyone watch james franco's speech from the golden globes last night after he won?
[1/8/18, 9:17:40 AM] Donk: he called tommy wiseu up on stage, but then when tommy tried to speak, he pushed him out of the way and just like "nope"
[1/8/18, 9:17:43 AM] Donk: it was pretty hilarious
[1/8/18, 9:18:43 AM] Dan Watts: Lmao I missed that but need to see it
[1/8/18, 9:19:17 AM] Miller: o man
[1/8/18, 9:19:18 AM] Miller: did not
[1/8/18, 9:22:47 AM] Miller: ha, he knows better than anyone what would have happened if he had let tommy speak
[1/8/18, 9:23:19 AM] Donk: it would have been great
[1/8/18, 9:23:31 AM] Donk: he could have at least let him get in a "oh hai america"
[1/8/18, 9:25:28 AM] Miller: if he had gotten hold of that mic theres 150% chance he would still be speaking right now
[1/8/18, 11:10:16 AM] Justin: Missed that lol

[1/8/18, 11:21:31 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/8/18, 11:30:21 AM] Launchpad: for those of you concerned, the weed market has completely shaken off the 'Sessions Dip'
[1/8/18, 11:30:49 AM] Brian Katz: Is that like a drench onion dip?
[1/8/18, 11:31:09 AM] Launchpad: made by a keebler elf
[1/8/18, 11:31:29 AM] Brian Katz: They make cookies fool
[1/8/18, 11:31:43 AM] Miller: nobody was concerned
[1/8/18, 11:38:15 AM] Launchpad: Did you do a poll? Sounds like #fakenews to me
[1/8/18, 11:38:21 AM] Launchpad: https://ryanholiday.net/stop-watching-the-news/
[1/8/18, 11:42:15 AM] Justin: "He reads multiple newspapers a day. "....fake news
[1/8/18, 11:45:43 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/8/18, 11:46:12 AM] Justin: strongly agree with that article though LP
[1/8/18, 11:47:15 AM] Justin: except the p[picture of the earth, thats also fake news, earth is clearly flat

[1/8/18, 2:09:14 PM] Miller: Herman getting his brother to subtweet
[1/8/18, 2:12:46 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/8/18, 2:13:08 PM] Launchpad: thats such a cunty thing to say
[1/8/18, 2:13:27 PM] Launchpad: how do you expect to be the moral authority when you just hurl insults at people whos views you don't like
[1/8/18, 2:13:47 PM] Launchpad: so what did that bald fuck say anyway?
[1/8/18, 2:13:52 PM] Donk: also, is he not a disgrace to all jewish people? why only to american jewish people?
[1/8/18, 2:14:01 PM] Donk: i dont know, it was something about stephen miller
[1/8/18, 2:15:11 PM] Justin: were entering snowflake territory when you start telling people moral authority is indicated by refrane
[1/8/18, 2:15:46 PM] Justin: i can be an asshole, speak like an asshole, and still claim a higher moral/ethical ground....language doesnt eqaute morality
[1/8/18, 2:16:18 PM] Brian Katz: I don‚Äôt know what you just said, but I‚Äôm going to take it as an insult
[1/8/18, 2:16:25 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/8/18, 2:16:37 PM] Justin: calling someone a dumb fuck doesnt mean your argument is invalid
[1/8/18, 2:16:52 PM] Justin: it in fact has nothing to do with your argument
[1/8/18, 2:17:14 PM] Launchpad: im just saying when claim that God made you bald cause you're evil, it doesn't sound much different than saying God made you gay cause your evil
[1/8/18, 2:17:29 PM] Launchpad: or that being gay goes against Gods will
[1/8/18, 2:17:55 PM] Justin: well stephan is an atheist
[1/8/18, 2:18:06 PM] Justin: so does that negate the entire argument you are making?
[1/8/18, 2:18:13 PM] Justin: he doesnt believe in god, therefore god didnt do anything
[1/8/18, 2:18:25 PM] Donk: it certainly takes the sting out of his insult knowing that he doesnt believe in god
[1/8/18, 2:18:34 PM] Launchpad: you can't expect to be hurling cheap insults while hoping to maintain  credibility
[1/8/18, 2:19:01 PM] Justin: is stephan miller a terrible person
[1/8/18, 2:19:04 PM] Justin: -------yes
[1/8/18, 2:19:05 PM] Donk: (all of this being said, i also think that stephen miller is a douche)
[1/8/18, 2:19:15 PM] Justin: does he lie about most things---------yes
[1/8/18, 2:19:35 PM] Justin: does stephan tellign him hes been cursed by god as bald take away form that -----------no
[1/8/18, 2:19:40 PM] Launchpad: who the f is stephen miller?
[1/8/18, 2:19:54 PM] Justin: the person he is liekly referring to
[1/8/18, 2:19:59 PM] Donk: no, but his insults were def entertaining
[1/8/18, 2:20:34 PM] Justin: some neo nazi piece of shit, that wants to silience freedom of the press for questions the deer leader
[1/8/18, 2:21:06 PM] Miller: freudian slip?
[1/8/18, 2:21:10 PM] Justin: lol
[1/8/18, 2:21:24 PM] Justin: thoguht about that after
[1/8/18, 2:22:37 PM] Justin: typos here probably show its just me not my subconscious
[1/8/18, 2:24:49 PM] Brian Katz: I thought Stephan miller was the greatest love story of our time
[1/8/18, 2:26:30 PM] Launchpad: well this anti-bald propaganda needs to stop
[1/8/18, 2:26:55 PM] Launchpad: On behalf of bald people everywhere, I don't exist to be the punchline of your jokes

[1/8/18, 2:35:11 PM] Launchpad: Travis Kalanick pulls an ‚Äò85 Steve Jobs and cashes in 29% of his Uber stake for $1.4B 

Ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, the same man who once bragged about never selling any of his stake in the company, now plans to sell 29% of his personal Uber shares to SoftBank and several other investors.

And that‚Äôs ‚Äúonly‚Äù because Uber wouldn‚Äôt let him sell more...

[1/8/18, 5:49:40 PM] Launchpad: is this actually real???
[1/8/18, 5:50:29 PM] Launchpad: I made a Great Trump Wall joke and got the meanest look form an SJW in Brooklyn
[1/8/18, 5:50:53 PM] Miller: Can't be joking around about that shit in Brooklyn
[1/8/18, 5:54:13 PM] Brian Katz: I feel that people in spite of our joke of a president, have lost their sense of humor.
[1/8/18, 5:56:00 PM] Launchpad: #sad
[1/8/18, 5:56:19 PM] Launchpad: I for one, have only gotten funnier
[1/8/18, 6:04:16 PM] Miller: Who you calling a joke?
[1/8/18, 6:04:28 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/8/18, 6:33:03 PM] Justin: Well now you must present us with said great joke
[1/8/18, 6:33:31 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/8/18, 6:34:39 PM] Launchpad: In response to Americans visiting China to see the Great Wall I suggested -- "Do you think that in 10 years the Chinese will be flying to America to see the Great Trump Wall?"
[1/8/18, 6:36:57 PM] Justin: Wouldn't say it's that funny. Clearly Not offensive either
[1/8/18, 6:37:22 PM] Launchpad: The funniest part is seeing everyone elses reaction when I tell it
[1/8/18, 6:37:28 PM] Justin: Probably closer to accurate
[1/8/18, 7:33:13 PM] Dan Watts: Have a feeling that girl will be lonely for a very long time
[1/8/18, 7:34:44 PM] Dan Watts: Best part is end where she says you have to love me no matter what I do yet she places 48 restrictions on her partner.
[1/8/18, 7:42:29 PM] Launchpad: Welcome to the Matriarchy
[1/8/18, 7:43:25 PM] Scott: That's how it always starts
[1/8/18, 7:44:11 PM] Launchpad: They said there would be cookies but they lied
[1/8/18, 8:07:59 PM] Justin: lets be real, her actual list could be 1 long, "dont cheat on me", and 90% of men would fail.  Don't think were in this supposed matriarchy just yet
[1/8/18, 8:10:52 PM] Launchpad: do you think men are worse cheaters than women?
[1/8/18, 8:11:15 PM] Justin: maybe you sling that weak dick, idk
[1/8/18, 8:11:29 PM] Justin: was waitning with that predictable softball to come back at you with your own logic
[1/8/18, 11:23:19 PM] Brian Katz: You must have been seriously unfunny before I met you lol
[1/8/18, 11:24:42 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/9/18, 8:34:40 AM] Miller: katz's favorite person lena dunham and jack antonoff broke up, but the best tidbit came from the comments section
[1/9/18, 8:34:42 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 8:39:41 AM] Brian Katz: That was probably the only picture of Lena he could stomach,
[1/9/18, 10:01:35 AM] Tk: That Alabama/Georgia ending gave me flashbacks of the Ravens' gm endingüò¢üò≠üò≠
[1/9/18, 10:02:21 AM] Miller: that was brutal for GA
[1/9/18, 10:02:28 AM] Donk: yeah, rough loss
[1/9/18, 10:02:39 AM] Donk: esp after the game looked won when they had that first down sack
[1/9/18, 10:02:51 AM] Donk: my only complaint with the game was it going until 1215
[1/9/18, 10:03:05 AM] Donk: need to start that shit earlier
[1/9/18, 10:03:22 AM] Launchpad: I was good with that ending time
[1/9/18, 10:03:58 AM] Miller: your fascination with timezones never ceases to be hilarious and entertaining
[1/9/18, 10:04:08 AM] Miller: enjoy waking up at 4am for the london game
[1/9/18, 10:04:51 AM] Miller: id always rather stay up late then risk missing the beginning of a game
[1/9/18, 10:04:54 AM] Launchpad: its actually starts at 6:30, which Im pretty much up by on most days
[1/9/18, 10:05:16 AM] Miller: if youre up at 630am on a sunday you are not living your best life
[1/9/18, 10:05:27 AM] Launchpad: honestly it not that hard to wake up early for football even if your hungover
[1/9/18, 10:05:41 AM] Launchpad: you roll over and get on the couch thats it
[1/9/18, 10:06:45 AM] Launchpad: also I would rather be at home from work by 4:30pm and not 7:30pm
[1/9/18, 10:07:16 AM] Miller: thats nice you have that priviledge, the majority of people dont get home from work by 430pm
[1/9/18, 10:07:35 AM] Miller: if rather just be retired and not work at all and be home all day
[1/9/18, 10:07:38 AM] Miller: but such is life
[1/9/18, 10:12:49 AM] Launchpad: damn throwin around that P word again
[1/9/18, 10:13:53 AM] Miller: i mean you saying things starting early isnt an issue b/c you get home at 430 is like me saying it doesnt matter if things end late b/c i dont have to be into work until 11
[1/9/18, 10:14:09 AM] Miller: sure that is probably the case for a very small minority of people but largely irrelevant
[1/9/18, 10:22:03 AM] Launchpad: you NYers work longer later hours and have longer commutes on average
[1/9/18, 10:22:28 AM] Miller: nobody in the country normally is home by 430pm
[1/9/18, 10:22:30 AM] Miller: NY or not NY
[1/9/18, 10:23:08 AM] Launchpad: govt workers and californians

[1/9/18, 11:32:18 AM] Justin: damn bb kings is the worst also with pricing....fucken gordon lightfoot cost 85$
[1/9/18, 11:33:40 AM] Justin: to preemptively answer your question miller/katz, donk knows who he is(presumably)....and he should not cost 85 fucken dollars
[1/9/18, 11:34:08 AM] Donk: my question is why were you even looking at the prices of a gordon lightfoot show, let alone planning on goinglol?
[1/9/18, 11:34:21 AM] Justin: took my dad there as birthday gift couple years ago
[1/9/18, 11:34:34 AM] Donk: thats a very good answer haha
[1/9/18, 11:34:52 AM] Donk: id say $25-35 would be more than a fair price for that
[1/9/18, 11:35:01 AM] Miller: yea thats insane
[1/9/18, 11:35:06 AM] Miller: nothing at BB kings should cost that much
[1/9/18, 11:35:07 AM] Justin: agreed, that place doesnt charge 25-35........unless
[1/9/18, 11:35:09 AM] Donk: 85 better come with VIP and some free drinks
[1/9/18, 11:35:13 AM] Miller: especially a guy nobody has heard of
[1/9/18, 11:36:16 AM] Justin: maybe they know the clientelle all over the age of 55 can pay
[1/9/18, 11:36:23 AM] Justin: hes like the cnaadian bob dylan
[1/9/18, 11:36:38 AM] Justin: well  hes literally the canadain bob dylan
[1/9/18, 11:37:12 AM] Miller: i wouldnt pay $85 to go see the american bob dylan
[1/9/18, 11:38:01 AM] Justin: its funny because i just unsubscribed to junk email form bb kings, with that memory of those tickets costing so much still freshly implanted in my mind
[1/9/18, 11:38:19 AM] Miller: good luck, i have unsubscribed from there probably 20x
[1/9/18, 11:38:31 AM] Miller: them and the prudential center will never let me go
[1/9/18, 11:38:53 AM] Donk: i saw bob dylan a few years ago for like 10 bucks
[1/9/18, 11:38:58 AM] Donk: that was about the right price imo
[1/9/18, 11:39:58 AM] Justin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2DjqB0SO9M
[1/9/18, 11:40:40 AM] Justin: pretty much canadas ed sheeran right there
[1/9/18, 11:41:28 AM] Donk: (on a side note, that was the greatest ticketmaster scam of all time - Starwood resorts was haivng this special where if you signed up for a starwood rewards account, they gave you a 50.00 coupon for ticketmaster that wasnt tied to your email so you could keep creating fake emails and gathering more and more of these coupon codes. basically saw a dozen concerts that summer for next to nothing)

[1/9/18, 12:47:37 PM] Launchpad: getting attacked with üçÜ from the left & right
[1/9/18, 12:47:41 PM] Justin: shows how dumb society is... she doesnt wear black means "she doesnt care about feminism", she dresses scantily implies " she doesnt care about feminism"....
[1/9/18, 12:51:16 PM] Justin: I mean when the rock rolls around without a shirt on, do you consider that objectification or sexualzation of his manhood?  It's quite clearly a double standard.
[1/9/18, 12:52:14 PM] Brian Katz: They do that so they can show the ladies what they got. So they can get it in. So I guess yes.
[1/9/18, 12:52:17 PM] Launchpad: yes
[1/9/18, 12:52:50 PM] Justin: so fat men who dont wear a shirt to the beach ar eselling sexuality?
[1/9/18, 12:53:03 PM] Launchpad: poorly but yes
[1/9/18, 12:53:13 PM] Justin: lol
[1/9/18, 12:53:17 PM] Brian Katz: They have no shame
[1/9/18, 12:53:30 PM] Launchpad: when I walk around in booty shorts I am putting my sexuality on display
[1/9/18, 12:53:43 PM] Justin: and some other things
[1/9/18, 12:53:46 PM] Launchpad: anyone who dresses like that and says they're just being comfortable is a fucking liar
[1/9/18, 12:53:52 PM] Launchpad: sweat pants are comfortable
[1/9/18, 12:54:03 PM] Launchpad: aint nobody wearing sweatpants to the oscars
[1/9/18, 12:54:25 PM] Justin: well thats kinda the point
[1/9/18, 12:54:38 PM] Justin: its not purely "genetic"
[1/9/18, 12:54:39 PM] Launchpad: I hung dong for the thrill of it
[1/9/18, 12:54:49 PM] Brian Katz: And they might like to bath in the sun
[1/9/18, 12:54:51 PM] Justin: society pushes standards
[1/9/18, 12:55:11 PM] Brian Katz: What do you mean
[1/9/18, 12:55:21 PM] Justin: she isnt allowed to show up in sweatpants to red carpet
[1/9/18, 12:55:35 PM] Justin: neither are the men, but thats the point
[1/9/18, 12:55:48 PM] Justin: society pushes women to dressing like that, encourages it
[1/9/18, 12:55:56 PM] Justin: how many men were wearing anythign but a tux?
[1/9/18, 12:56:07 PM] Justin: doenst mean it isnt profitable or a good career move for the women
[1/9/18, 12:56:14 PM] Brian Katz: If lady Gaga can show up in a raw meat dress, you can surely show up in sweatpants
[1/9/18, 12:56:28 PM] Justin: it's just not as easy as saying, look at this dumb broad flaunting her tits and preaching about feminism
[1/9/18, 12:56:52 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs what she did though
[1/9/18, 12:57:16 PM] Justin: yeh, and why doenst the rock show up flaiutning his sexuality?
[1/9/18, 12:57:42 PM] Brian Katz: What are you saying? Your text makes no sense
[1/9/18, 12:57:43 PM] Justin: why is she financialy incentvized to show her tits , but the rock not incentivized to show his
[1/9/18, 12:57:45 PM] Miller: i mean its consistent, feminism, or the belief that men and women should be treated equally, says women should be able to wear w/e they want to wear w/o judgement
[1/9/18, 12:58:25 PM] Brian Katz: He has no tits
[1/9/18, 12:58:48 PM] Justin: but he has a masculine body that "sells"
[1/9/18, 12:59:01 PM] Brian Katz: And he flaunts it
[1/9/18, 12:59:07 PM] Justin: not on red carpet
[1/9/18, 12:59:36 PM] Justin: there has to be a reason 100% of men wear tuxes
[1/9/18, 12:59:53 PM] Justin: its not rocket science to realize that society creates these standards

[1/9/18, 1:03:53 PM] Launchpad: She could have dressed like Michelle Obama and people wouldn't have said anything
[1/9/18, 1:04:06 PM] Justin: just saying its not rocket science to figure out its both financially reqarding and societally encouraged for women to show their sexuality
[1/9/18, 1:04:14 PM] Brian Katz: Some black guy at the mtv awards

[1/9/18, 1:05:41 PM] Brian Katz: Men exploit that too. I remember seeing David Beckham in his underwear outside of the midtown tunnel for months
[1/9/18, 1:06:12 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 1:06:49 PM] Launchpad: are we done with shirtless men for the day?

[1/9/18, 1:08:31 PM] Launchpad: he seems pretty happy exploiting herself tbh
[1/9/18, 1:08:36 PM] Launchpad: **she
[1/9/18, 1:09:04 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 1:09:06 PM] Miller: as usual im now extremely confused about what the point was
[1/9/18, 1:09:21 PM] Miller: you cannot be against sexual assault unless you wear a burkha in public?
[1/9/18, 1:09:27 PM] Launchpad: me too
[1/9/18, 1:09:30 PM] Justin: essentially
[1/9/18, 1:09:53 PM] Justin: and you cant wear a burka and be for womens rights either ....so not essentially
[1/9/18, 1:10:41 PM] Justin: pretty much if you fit into this small vacuum of what a man dictates it acceptably not objectifiying yourself or on the other extreme too prudish, than your good
[1/9/18, 1:11:40 PM] Brian Katz: Herman do you at all ever feel like a man?
[1/9/18, 1:12:17 PM] Justin: i mean I eat meat and drink beer, so yeh...what about you?
[1/9/18, 1:12:45 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 1:13:34 PM] Justin: lol
[1/9/18, 1:13:53 PM] Brian Katz: Herman if you were boarding a plane and a women was piloting it. Would you be at all scared for your life?
[1/9/18, 1:13:53 PM] Launchpad: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[1/9/18, 1:14:07 PM] Justin: is she asian?
[1/9/18, 1:14:22 PM] Brian Katz: No she‚Äôs Puerto Rican
[1/9/18, 1:14:37 PM] Justin: they usually wear pants in the family, im cool with it
[1/9/18, 1:14:46 PM] Brian Katz: Boom
[1/9/18, 1:15:19 PM] Brian Katz: Would you feel fully confident to get heart surgery from a women.
[1/9/18, 1:16:06 PM] Justin: I can honestly tell you without trolling, I have no disntiction in my mind on the ability of men versus women to do most these tasks
[1/9/18, 1:16:17 PM] Justin: i can also say i would never watch a wnba game
[1/9/18, 1:16:22 PM] Miller: would you rather have a professional female heart surgeon operate on you or @16465236894 ?
[1/9/18, 1:16:30 PM] Launchpad: https://www.facebook.com/barstoolsports/videos/10156201891602502/
[1/9/18, 1:16:32 PM] Miller: ill take the female surgeon
[1/9/18, 1:16:32 PM] Miller: godspeed
[1/9/18, 1:16:42 PM] Brian Katz: Is James trained?
[1/9/18, 1:16:51 PM] Miller: hes a nurse, but hes a man
[1/9/18, 1:16:56 PM] Miller: so i figure that balances it out
[1/9/18, 1:16:57 PM] Brian Katz: Then no
[1/9/18, 1:17:35 PM] Justin: IDK what part of the genetic code make a women less intelligent/ capable than a man
[1/9/18, 1:17:33 PM] Miller: unless its something related to manual labor or something related to physical strength then who gives a fuck
[1/9/18, 1:17:37 PM] Brian Katz: But I‚Äôd take any other male surgeon...that‚Äôs not from a third world country of the women.
[1/9/18, 1:17:43 PM] Justin: this
[1/9/18, 1:18:27 PM] Brian Katz: Sally rides space ship blew up. Coincidence? I think not.

[1/9/18, 1:23:31 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 1:25:41 PM] Miller: katz what gender was the pilot on the last flight you were on
[1/9/18, 1:26:11 PM] Brian Katz: Make
[1/9/18, 1:26:14 PM] Brian Katz: Male*
[1/9/18, 2:40:56 PM] Justin: oh damn...miller next leveled you there
[1/9/18, 2:41:17 PM] Brian Katz: I loved didn‚Äôt I
[1/9/18, 2:41:21 PM] Brian Katz: Lived*

[1/9/18, 2:43:54 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 2:44:22 PM] Justin: taking a quick look at numbers here, katz may be onto something
[1/9/18, 2:45:31 PM] Justin: nm... hes wrong
[1/9/18, 2:45:47 PM] Justin: i saw this "Hopkins scholars looked at crashes of civilian, noncommercial planes from 1983 to 1997 involving 144 female and 287 male pilots over 40 years of age.:... which made me think hes right
[1/9/18, 2:47:10 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[1/9/18, 2:47:44 PM] Brian Katz: How many male pilots are there to female?
[1/9/18, 2:48:15 PM] Justin: thats why i thoguht you were right
[1/9/18, 2:48:23 PM] Justin: but this is civilian
[1/9/18, 2:48:37 PM] Brian Katz: Even so
[1/9/18, 2:48:38 PM] Justin: and apprently in general data on its own shows more femaiole crashes
[1/9/18, 2:48:42 PM] Miller: get me the commercial #s, none of this non-commercial nonsense
[1/9/18, 2:48:51 PM] Justin: but adjustd for traning expeirnce and etc
[1/9/18, 2:48:56 PM] Brian Katz: Women can‚Äôt drive shit
[1/9/18, 2:48:58 PM] Justin: its same for both sexes
[1/9/18, 2:49:21 PM] Justin: "After adjusting for variables included in the model, accident rates of males and females were not significantly different. These findings suggest that neither males nor females are a safer pilot group. Airlines should make every effort to recruit and retain experienced females. The key challenge for managers of airline flight operations is to learn how to manage diversity in the workplace, while maintaining the highest level of safety.
[1/9/18, 2:49:27 PM] Miller: furthermore these planes are all flown by computer so im fine w/self driving planes
[1/9/18, 2:49:30 PM] Justin: but thats after adjusting......
[1/9/18, 2:49:50 PM] Justin: on the surface katz wins
[1/9/18, 2:49:55 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/9/18, 2:49:59 PM] Brian Katz: Boom

[1/9/18, 4:26:25 PM] Kiyoon: he was terrible
[1/9/18, 4:27:23 PM] Brian Katz: It was MURDER
[1/9/18, 4:28:11 PM] Justin: for FREE, where would he be without you
[1/9/18, 4:28:46 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm real

[1/9/18, 4:43:02 PM] Donk: i think today discussion answers this question katz. You will have super strength but only when fighting women.
[1/9/18, 4:43:37 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs redundant Donk
[1/9/18, 4:44:00 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 4:44:01 PM] Donk: i know, thats what sucks about it
[1/9/18, 4:44:07 PM] Brian Katz: Lol

[1/9/18, 4:45:11 PM] Brian Katz: Kale 11? That‚Äôs a super good
[1/9/18, 4:45:26 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 4:45:39 PM] Miller: drew margary has spoken
[1/9/18, 4:45:47 PM] Miller: all other lettuce takes will be rendered irrelevant
[1/9/18, 4:45:57 PM] Donk: my issue with iceberg isnt the nutrional value
[1/9/18, 4:46:03 PM] Launchpad: put some tortilla strips in that salad if you want crunch
[1/9/18, 4:46:24 PM] Donk: just that it is flavorless, and is bascially only good as a vessel for dressing
[1/9/18, 4:46:37 PM] Donk: its still better than kale though
[1/9/18, 4:46:49 PM] Brian Katz: Stop sleeping on kale
[1/9/18, 4:47:04 PM] Miller: or lettuce wraps or something
[1/9/18, 4:47:18 PM] Donk: ok, that too
[1/9/18, 4:47:30 PM] Donk: but you can use bibb lettuce for lettuce wraps, and its far superior
[1/9/18, 4:47:43 PM] Launchpad: gluten free meat vessel
[1/9/18, 4:48:04 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 4:48:16 PM] Miller: ive only ever had bibb lettuce shredded
[1/9/18, 4:48:26 PM] Launchpad: animal style protein style
[1/9/18, 4:48:26 PM] Miller: reminds me of the big mac lettuce
[1/9/18, 4:48:29 PM] Launchpad: my favorite
[1/9/18, 4:48:33 PM] Miller: so cannot comment on its effacy as a wrap
[1/9/18, 4:52:16 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 4:52:47 PM] Brian Katz: Are you doing that because if things you‚Äôve done in the past?
[1/9/18, 4:53:03 PM] Launchpad: the color wheel of harassing behavior -- stay green my friends
[1/9/18, 4:53:59 PM] Launchpad: banging your secretary, thats dark orange zone @16102201963
[1/9/18, 4:57:59 PM] Miller: Stephen K. Bannon is stepping down from his post as executive chairman of Breitbart News, the company announced Tuesday.
[1/9/18, 4:59:07 PM] Kiyoon: had my first burger with lettuce as the buns the other day
[1/9/18, 4:59:09 PM] Kiyoon: actually not that bad

[1/9/18, 5:03:05 PM] Miller: guy slaps woman
[1/9/18, 5:03:08 PM] Miller: woman gets blamed
[1/9/18, 5:03:14 PM] Miller: sounds about right

[1/9/18, 5:43:51 PM] Justin: throwing shade in an academic textbook...........   "This nicely returns the top ten players by career on base percentage.  Notice that Billy Hamilton and Bill Joyce are absent from our results because they are mysteriously missing from the baseball data.
[1/9/18, 6:03:25 PM] Brian Katz: Barry bonds gotta be on there. Guy was walked the most of any player
[1/9/18, 6:05:40 PM] Scott: As if she didn't want it...come on now.

[1/10/18, 9:14:36 AM] Miller: but if anyone wants to go, enjoy
[1/10/18, 9:15:23 AM] Scott: U looking to go at some point ?
[1/10/18, 9:15:42 AM] Miller: idk, kind of indifferent
[1/10/18, 9:16:26 AM] Scott: As am i
[1/10/18, 9:16:39 AM] Miller: steve asked me to register for some pre-sale and out of curiousity i went to look if it was even sold out and im like presale nothing dude theres tickets available for tomorrow, but then went and checked and seemed like all the other dates were actually sold out so seemed like a good opportunity to get tixx @ face value
[1/10/18, 9:16:48 AM] Brian Katz: Just realized it‚Äôs MLK day on Monday!! Three day weekend, and playoff football!!!
[1/10/18, 9:17:03 AM] Miller: pfft ive been looking forward to that for months
[1/10/18, 9:17:20 AM] Miller: but there is nothing better than realizing late you have a long weekend
[1/10/18, 9:17:24 AM] Miller: changes your whole mindset
[1/10/18, 9:17:38 AM] Brian Katz: It really does

[1/10/18, 12:31:13 PM] Justin: So it was on point
[1/10/18, 12:31:16 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/10/18, 12:31:16 PM] Launchpad: I think it implies bunny rabbits
[1/10/18, 12:31:41 PM] Scott: Sources: The Houston Astros have engaged with the Pittsburgh Pirates on trade talks for starter Gerrit Cole. One name bandied about as a return: outfielder Derek Fisher. For a trade to happen, Pirates almost certainly would need Kyle Tucker or Forrest Whitley as a centerpiece.
[1/10/18, 12:31:55 PM] Scott: so wait, derek fisher is going to the astros with forrest whitaker?
[1/10/18, 12:31:57 PM] Miller: its already done
[1/10/18, 12:32:48 PM] Miller: is there an alternate new herman where you repeat news but instead of adding something new you actually add something old?
[1/10/18, 12:32:54 PM] Miller: new cheese?
[1/10/18, 12:32:57 PM] Miller: and its done
[1/10/18, 12:33:16 PM] Miller: @17189742074 get the photo
[1/10/18, 12:34:38 PM] Brian Katz: He‚Äôs making a name joke not trying to give us news. It‚Äôs so not funny you may have missed the joke.
[1/10/18, 12:35:13 PM] Justin: @17189742074 @16102201963   If I end up dying be sure to sue my gym for me

[1/10/18, 12:37:28 PM] Brian Katz: Are you working out in an auto repair shop?
[1/10/18, 12:37:31 PM] Launchpad: thats a gym? Looks like the bowels of a ship
[1/10/18, 12:37:50 PM] Miller: i have a nicer gym in my house
[1/10/18, 12:37:59 PM] Miller: and way less propane tanks
[1/10/18, 12:37:59 PM] Brian Katz: I just joined la fitness, it has a basketball court lol.
[1/10/18, 12:38:11 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 12:38:19 PM] Miller: oh and no heating
[1/10/18, 12:38:21 PM] Miller: sick
[1/10/18, 12:38:28 PM] Brian Katz: You pay for access to this?
[1/10/18, 12:38:39 PM] Miller: how much you paying a month to work out in this scene out of Saw?
[1/10/18, 12:38:57 PM] Kiyoon: looks like Bumblebees insides
[1/10/18, 12:39:01 PM] Brian Katz: Your gym is garbage honey
[1/10/18, 12:39:11 PM] Brian Katz: Homey*
[1/10/18, 12:39:14 PM] Justin: Cheap. Lol
[1/10/18, 12:39:19 PM] Brian Katz: Homie*

[1/10/18, 12:39:43 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 12:39:44 PM] Justin: Well it's irrelevant. Similar gym costs 200$ month on Long Island
[1/10/18, 12:39:48 PM] Justin: Just ask at miller
[1/10/18, 12:40:01 PM] Brian Katz: Omg you pay close to 200?
[1/10/18, 12:40:13 PM] Justin: Place probably had more money in equipment than your la fitness
[1/10/18, 12:40:28 PM] Brian Katz: I pay $35 a month
[1/10/18, 12:40:30 PM] Justin: Mono lifts alone are worth god knows how much.
[1/10/18, 12:40:33 PM] Justin: I pay less
[1/10/18, 12:40:40 PM] Justin: But irrelevant
[1/10/18, 12:40:42 PM] Brian Katz: And I get a jacuzzi and b-ball court
[1/10/18, 12:40:54 PM] Justin: Do you get a mono lift?
[1/10/18, 12:40:59 PM] Justin: Reverse hyper machine?
[1/10/18, 12:41:01 PM] Justin: Chains?
[1/10/18, 12:41:06 PM] Brian Katz: Do get a mono lift?
[1/10/18, 12:41:09 PM] Justin: 12 different bars?
[1/10/18, 12:41:27 PM] Justin: Bands etc
[1/10/18, 12:41:36 PM] Justin: I know the answer to all this shit is no.
[1/10/18, 12:41:51 PM] Justin: You get some fake ass plates with some bs ass bar and a bunch cardio machines
[1/10/18, 12:41:52 PM] Brian Katz: For using all this crazy equipment and eating all your protein powder, why aren‚Äôt you eat more jacked?
[1/10/18, 12:42:04 PM] Brian Katz: Way*
[1/10/18, 12:42:18 PM] Justin: I don't eat protein powder
[1/10/18, 12:42:30 PM] Miller: forget your mono lift
[1/10/18, 12:42:35 PM] Miller: im working out at home depot
[1/10/18, 12:42:40 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 12:42:52 PM] Miller: and heat
[1/10/18, 12:42:57 PM] Justin: Lol
[1/10/18, 12:42:59 PM] Miller: so theres that
[1/10/18, 12:43:18 PM] Justin: I'm just saying. Previous to the heat issue his place is a gidden gem.
[1/10/18, 12:43:24 PM] Justin: Hidden*
[1/10/18, 12:43:31 PM] Miller: heat, kind of a big deal in the northeast
[1/10/18, 12:43:37 PM] Justin: But hard to look past heatnissue
[1/10/18, 12:43:40 PM] Brian Katz: Your place is a car shop with weight equipment.
[1/10/18, 12:43:57 PM] Justin: Essentially
[1/10/18, 12:43:58 PM] Miller: he probably gets discounts on auto repairs though
[1/10/18, 12:44:14 PM] Justin: That same kind of gym costs 200 in Long Island
[1/10/18, 12:44:30 PM] Brian Katz: You should be training to fight mason the line Dixon in there. Not hyper lifting.
[1/10/18, 12:44:43 PM] Miller: lol yes
[1/10/18, 12:44:44 PM] Donk: i like the multiple dont tread on me painting/signs
[1/10/18, 12:44:58 PM] Justin: Lol
[1/10/18, 12:45:08 PM] Justin: He's definitely old white man racist
[1/10/18, 12:45:13 PM] Brian Katz: How‚Äôd you find this place? Googled garbage gyms in my area?
[1/10/18, 12:45:17 PM] Justin: Although he didn't actually hang those
[1/10/18, 12:46:47 PM] Brian Katz: I missed this before lol!!!
[1/10/18, 12:46:49 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 12:47:33 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[1/10/18, 12:47:42 PM] Justin: Been dropping ball lately on lifting because heat issue.
[1/10/18, 12:47:44 PM] Brian Katz: Omg how?
[1/10/18, 12:47:48 PM] Justin: Although it seems fixed finally
[1/10/18, 12:48:01 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 12:48:09 PM] Justin: Been mia from gym most of past month
[1/10/18, 12:48:22 PM] Justin: Well I hear  the heater on.
[1/10/18, 12:48:32 PM] Justin: Lol nah it isn't
[1/10/18, 12:48:50 PM] Justin: Although he has sleds and ropes for cardio if you please
[1/10/18, 12:49:08 PM] Miller: you have a tetanus shot?
[1/10/18, 12:49:10 PM] Miller: just wondering
[1/10/18, 12:49:31 PM] Miller: did it come free w/signing up?
[1/10/18, 12:50:31 PM] Justin: Wipe aids off deadlift bar before lifting everytine
[1/10/18, 12:51:00 PM] Miller: i mean thats not how you get aids, but that place is 93% rusted metal so......
[1/10/18, 12:51:24 PM] Brian Katz: Looks like they last updated their equipment in 1992
[1/10/18, 12:51:58 PM] Miller: also is anyone else there? how many members this guy got
[1/10/18, 12:53:30 PM] Brian Katz: @16316620763 I always got to ask this, but are you trying to accomplish there? Like are you trying to get into shape? Look good naked? Get jacked up? What‚Äôs the deal here?
[1/10/18, 12:53:48 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 12:54:08 PM] Miller: freeze to death? get lockjaw?
[1/10/18, 12:54:36 PM] Justin: Lift things up and put them down?
[1/10/18, 12:54:57 PM] Justin: I mean why are you trying to run a race?
[1/10/18, 12:55:10 PM] Justin: Are you gonna even finish in top half of the race?
[1/10/18, 12:55:38 PM] Justin: Ou gonna be the bottom percentile of novice long distance racers?  Seems like an admirable goal
[1/10/18, 12:56:39 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De7rbB2bteE
[1/10/18, 12:59:41 PM] Justin: But your point will be pungent if I die in a gasoline explosion.
[1/10/18, 1:01:29 PM] Miller: on the plus side the jokes i could make about having a friend who died in a freak gasoline (explosion)

[1/10/18, 1:03:35 PM] Justin: Bone*
[1/10/18, 1:03:42 PM] Miller: throw cheese off a rollercoaster and hope for the best?
[1/10/18, 1:03:46 PM] Justin: He got it on 2nd try. I'll accept it
[1/10/18, 1:03:58 PM] Scott: That would make the ladies very sad.
[1/10/18, 1:04:14 PM] Miller: gotta be something about the name scott
[1/10/18, 1:04:14 PM] Justin: Yeh less free meals without sex
[1/10/18, 1:04:36 PM] Scott: Not a thing.

[1/10/18, 1:06:46 PM] Scott: straight gangsta.
[1/10/18, 1:07:21 PM] Miller: Lawyers for the drivers may collect fees equal to as much as one-third of the settlement fund.
[1/10/18, 1:07:52 PM] Scott: that is correct.
[1/10/18, 1:08:03 PM] Scott: it may get larger tbh, but we'll know in the next few months during objectin period etc.
[1/10/18, 1:08:15 PM] Scott: https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/uber-settles-with-ny-drivers-for-dollar3-million/vp-BBIaX2I
[1/10/18, 1:08:17 PM] Scott: o shit video
[1/10/18, 1:10:04 PM] Justin: Funny he just called me for first time ever.
[1/10/18, 1:10:29 PM] Justin: To tell me hears back on lol. Guess I'm not only one who gave up with no heat
[1/10/18, 1:18:27 PM] Miller: o snap no deal on astros/cole
[1/10/18, 1:18:36 PM] Miller: yankees swooping in
[1/10/18, 1:20:08 PM] Justin: That's why we shake it off
[1/10/18, 1:20:16 PM] Brian Katz: Because it a huge challenge and it distances me from who I was.
[1/10/18, 1:21:03 PM] Justin: Running pointlessly with no gains distances you?
[1/10/18, 1:22:23 PM] Justin: Usually end up in same place after running on a track, I could be missing something here.
[1/10/18, 1:22:31 PM] Brian Katz: The gains are endurance, it will help burn a ton of fat, make me mentally tougher, just to name a few
[1/10/18, 1:22:44 PM] Miller: unless you run in a big circle
[1/10/18, 1:22:48 PM] Brian Katz: Cut my body up
[1/10/18, 1:23:08 PM] Justin: So your goal is to cut your body up?
[1/10/18, 1:23:25 PM] Brian Katz: I would like that.
[1/10/18, 1:23:32 PM] Justin: Reading much more stimulating on mind than running
[1/10/18, 1:23:45 PM] Justin: As is solving puzzles or any number of things
[1/10/18, 1:23:46 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEXUFlh_EA
[1/10/18, 1:23:46 PM] Brian Katz: It focuses you
[1/10/18, 1:23:47 PM] Miller: CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES
[1/10/18, 1:23:57 PM] Brian Katz: This is my last resort
[1/10/18, 1:24:06 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs the name of Herman‚Äôs gym
[1/10/18, 1:24:19 PM] Miller: you ever tried reading puzzles while running?
[1/10/18, 1:25:05 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/10/18, 1:25:11 PM] Justin: I think what you do t realize is most these things are intangible. So when you ask a question about why I workout in terms of tangible reasons, it's pretty hypocritical question given your new found love of running in circles
[1/10/18, 1:25:59 PM] Justin: If you can't accept that, you should probably ponder it a little more rather than dismiss it
[1/10/18, 1:27:03 PM] Miller: my 12th grade physics teacher was named Mr Roach
[1/10/18, 1:27:03 PM] Miller: only teachers name i can ever remember
[1/10/18, 1:27:04 PM] Miller: b/c of constantly saying cut my life into pieces
[1/10/18, 1:32:45 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs not just running in circles. I had terrible endurance and could barely run around the track one time. The sustained running has helped me in almost any athletic venture I‚Äôve taken on since. Playing full court basket ball is much easier when I‚Äôm not sucking wind constantly, same as football. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out when I get a hit in baseball or have to track down a ball. I shoveled my entire driveway which is pretty big this week in a foot of snow, with no problems. I‚Äôve lowered my blood pressure increased my metabolism, got rid of my back pain, and generally feel great. So I ask you why are you trying to lift so much?
[1/10/18, 1:34:24 PM] Justin: So you run to play pickup baseball and basketball and shove your driveway when you could have spent that time doing innumerable amounts of more valuable things and paid a kid 20$?  you still don't somehow see where I'm going with this...
[1/10/18, 1:34:56 PM] Brian Katz: Where are you going with this?
[1/10/18, 1:35:33 PM] Brian Katz: Every step I take is one step further from who I was.
[1/10/18, 1:36:09 PM] Justin: So I take it you have done research  on how to maximize your running program?
[1/10/18, 1:36:33 PM] Justin: You are actively seeking knowledge on how to create a better excercose routine?
[1/10/18, 1:36:35 PM] Brian Katz: I actually bought a book on how to train for a marathon
[1/10/18, 1:37:36 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 1:38:12 PM] Launchpad: has anyone has the green cholula? is it good?
[1/10/18, 1:38:22 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs my favorite
[1/10/18, 1:38:52 PM] Kiyoon: Herman why you gotta bring down Katz
[1/10/18, 1:38:53 PM] Brian Katz: I order a huge bottle of it every month or so.i have it every morning for breakfast with my eggs and bacon
[1/10/18, 1:38:57 PM] Miller: for no reason i generally dislike the green sauces
[1/10/18, 1:39:05 PM] Miller: theyre usually not spicy
[1/10/18, 1:39:34 PM] Brian Katz: No I think they‚Äôre a little vinegary, that‚Äôs with I like them?
[1/10/18, 1:43:12 PM] Scott: Katzs weight loss if far greater than any accomplishment than Herman has done in his life. To even contemplate bringing him down is some ridiculous shit.
[1/10/18, 1:43:22 PM] Scott: #teamkatz
[1/10/18, 1:43:44 PM] Justin: I mean I've said multiple times my back pain comes back when I don't lift and it fully disappeared from lifting.  Overall strength goes up a ton, can open any jar I want. For the intangibles. I love the competitive nature of lifting and need to challenge myself to keep at something or I lose interest. When I'm lifting consistently I find it much easier to maintain a healthy diet because I recognize he correlation of pushing my body to the limit and proper calorie/nutritional intake. I like growing stronger and like the feeling of achievement from being able to lift more in every single lift than 99% of the comparable people at an la fitness. Being that you outlined your intangibles, are you now convinced as to the why I lift?
[1/10/18, 1:44:32 PM] Brian Katz: While I appreciate you seeing the magnitude of my accomplishment Cheese, don‚Äôt poo poo everything herman has accomplished. He‚Äôs done plenty of note worthy things in his life.
[1/10/18, 1:45:41 PM] Justin: Wtf are you taking about
[1/10/18, 1:45:53 PM] Launchpad: We know its not to stay warm or feel wealthy
[1/10/18, 1:46:38 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm with it! Get your strength up then, and make your back pain go away for good. Keep at it mi amigo!
[1/10/18, 1:46:41 PM] Justin: Cheese missing the point. The point is that because katz doesn't understand why I lift, doesn't mean I shouldn't lift.
[1/10/18, 1:46:55 PM] Brian Katz: Who is this directed at?
[1/10/18, 1:47:03 PM] Justin: Cheese
[1/10/18, 1:48:46 PM] Miller: radical idea
[1/10/18, 1:48:59 PM] Miller: everyone do w/e tf you want if it makes you happy and is not hurting anyone for w/e reason you want
[1/10/18, 1:49:49 PM] Brian Katz: I just wanted to know why Herm wanted to work out on the set of saw one.
[1/10/18, 1:57:53 PM] Launchpad: Very Libertarian of you
[1/10/18, 1:59:05 PM] Launchpad: Let me fix that for Herman:
"Everyone do w/e tf you want if you makes you happy as long as it doesn't make anyone feel bad because you've flaunted your wealth, status or privileged in their face"
[1/10/18, 1:59:41 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/10/18, 1:59:49 PM] Justin: It's like training in 3x gravity environment. Makes for more gains. See rocky 4 montage
[1/10/18, 2:00:17 PM] Miller: that wooden cabin was a billion times nicer
[1/10/18, 2:01:01 PM] Brian Katz: They had a fire place in the cabin. They didn‚Äôt have propane tanks randomly laid around on weights lol
[1/10/18, 2:01:26 PM] Justin: Yeh I generally get offended when someone hurts someone's feelings. Some guy once/many a time has  said to me " your always putting people in a box "
[1/10/18, 2:01:54 PM] Brian Katz: Never shove baby into a corner
[1/10/18, 2:05:06 PM] Justin: Idk why there is a view of liberals as pussies. I mean yeh I'm not a fighter without Red Bull and vodka but I generally don't get offended by language.
[1/10/18, 2:05:39 PM] Launchpad: I still nominate @16316620763 for the "Most likely to use an outdated stereotype to make snap judgements" Award
[1/10/18, 2:05:59 PM] Launchpad: Liberals == beta cucks
[1/10/18, 2:07:16 PM] Brian Katz: This is why
[1/10/18, 2:07:24 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 2:07:46 PM] Brian Katz: I think he won an award for bravery as well
[1/10/18, 2:08:12 PM] Justin: He's a conservative?
[1/10/18, 2:09:02 PM] Brian Katz: He/she is idk? It‚Äôs very confusing, alls I know is he can‚Äôt feed himself.
[1/10/18, 2:09:38 PM] Justin: That's next level. After being criticized for overgeneralizing criticize the same overgeneralization back...impressive
[1/10/18, 2:12:11 PM] Justin: Whatever I won't drink or eat red meat. You're the anti andre from unnecessary roughness
[1/10/18, 2:14:03 PM] Justin: I'm quoting myself for failure here. Obscure reference and it was wrong
[1/10/18, 2:17:05 PM] Brian Katz: I eat red meat
[1/10/18, 2:18:08 PM] Brian Katz: Andre doesn‚Äôt eat red meat, because Andre is a vegetarian.
[1/10/18, 2:32:05 PM] Justin: Dick doesn't count as red meat.
[1/10/18, 2:38:25 PM] Brian Katz: I eat red meat then for sure. What does do I count as?
[1/10/18, 2:38:29 PM] Miller: what if its a cows dick?
[1/10/18, 2:41:05 PM] Justin: Cow dick whole other level. That's advanced level red meat eating.
[1/10/18, 2:41:34 PM] Brian Katz: Is human meat red or white?
[1/10/18, 2:42:52 PM] Justin: Idk gotta ask my victims families
[1/10/18, 2:43:46 PM] Brian Katz: You make them eat their loved ones?
[1/10/18, 2:46:05 PM] Launchpad: The chineese love tiger dicks
[1/10/18, 2:46:13 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 2:46:37 PM] Launchpad: tiger dick -> enhanced virility -> more T
[1/10/18, 2:48:00 PM] Justin: Thus we have proven you can't eat your way to t levels
[1/10/18, 2:48:28 PM] Launchpad: sounds like the opposite
[1/10/18, 2:49:13 PM] Brian Katz: I think scotty is eating copious amounts of tiger dick.
[1/10/18, 3:09:28 PM] Justin: Was driving but come on you just went into katz territory. Claiming Asians got high t levels. I'll take one of the many solid  katz arguments. How many pro athletes you see from China?
[1/10/18, 3:10:20 PM] Brian Katz: Yao Ming, and that‚Äôs only because he was 7.11 or something
[1/10/18, 3:15:28 PM] Miller: are you forgetting youngho koo?
[1/10/18, 3:15:37 PM] Donk: weird, bo scarborough - alabamas back up rb, is declaring for the draft, but damien harris, the lead back, is staying in school
[1/10/18, 3:15:51 PM] Miller: damnit
[1/10/18, 3:15:59 PM] Miller: also lots of korean/japanese baseball players
[1/10/18, 3:16:33 PM] Miller: i would think any on the fence RB would go back w/how loaded this class is
[1/10/18, 3:16:55 PM] Miller: wonder if bo decided to go b/c harris is going back
[1/10/18, 3:19:09 PM] Donk: yeah, part of the problem is that last year had th same issue, and a few of the guys expected to go ended up going back (chubb, freeman)
[1/10/18, 3:19:36 PM] Launchpad: I did not claim that asians have high T levels
[1/10/18, 3:19:59 PM] Launchpad: Tiger penis is very expensive and very few can afford it
[1/10/18, 3:20:31 PM] Donk: yao mings father is a renowned tiger penis collecter and dealer
[1/10/18, 3:20:40 PM] Donk: he had yao eating tiger dicks since the crib
[1/10/18, 3:20:49 PM] Donk: hence his prolific height
[1/10/18, 3:21:02 PM] Launchpad: lolol
[1/10/18, 3:23:04 PM] Donk: Trump had ICE 98 7/11s today in an effort to find illegal workers
[1/10/18, 3:23:24 PM] Donk: arrested 21 people
[1/10/18, 3:23:34 PM] Donk: im sure thats a great use of taxpayer money
[1/10/18, 3:23:59 PM] Donk: ICE raid 98 7/11s that is
[1/10/18, 3:24:44 PM] Justin: He probably to dumb to realize most those guys aren't Muslims
[1/10/18, 3:25:38 PM] Justin: They wear a different funny hat
[1/10/18, 3:25:38 PM] Brian Katz: What are they Hindu?
[1/10/18, 3:26:18 PM] Justin: The ones with hat are sikhs
[1/10/18, 3:26:22 PM] Brian Katz: I actually had a 7/11 employee ask Kyle dowd the man with a taliban beard if he was at the meeting this week lol
[1/10/18, 3:26:29 PM] Justin: Haha
[1/10/18, 3:26:49 PM] Justin: I know that 7-11 guy. Hits on joia in Hindi hen she walks in with me
[1/10/18, 3:26:48 PM] Brian Katz: You can ask him next time you see him if you don‚Äôt believe me.
[1/10/18, 3:26:59 PM] Brian Katz: The one by your house
[1/10/18, 3:27:01 PM] Justin: And she pretends to be Spanish
[1/10/18, 3:27:52 PM] Miller: anyone have ESPN insider that can text or email me this article?

[1/10/18, 3:28:49 PM] Miller: no that was bill simmons
[1/10/18, 3:28:51 PM] Miller: but i hear hes due
[1/10/18, 3:29:27 PM] Justin: I read similarly titled article and it was all about how the system went -4
[1/10/18, 3:29:30 PM] Justin: 0-4
[1/10/18, 3:29:50 PM] Justin: Gonna suck when you owe cheese a favor and it's same reticle
[1/10/18, 3:30:15 PM] Scott: üôå
[1/10/18, 3:31:56 PM] Miller: if i lose $ ill send cheese a bill
[1/10/18, 3:37:45 PM] Scott: I'll request it from u in venmo. We gucci.
[1/10/18, 4:18:50 PM] Justin: i have to share this
[1/10/18, 4:19:04 PM] Justin: keep it on for about 35 seconds

[1/10/18, 4:21:02 PM] Justin: thats sort of irrelevant, presentation is what matters
[1/10/18, 4:23:01 PM] Miller: so far above my intelligence level, im taking the blue pill
[1/10/18, 4:23:28 PM] Brian Katz: Kill the line

[1/10/18, 4:46:18 PM] Launchpad: #HODL
[1/10/18, 4:46:27 PM] Miller: üëÄ
[1/10/18, 4:47:26 PM] Launchpad: #HODLing cryptos is the #1 wealth building formula in the world at the moment
[1/10/18, 4:47:51 PM] Launchpad: Even Kodak is getting in on the game

[1/10/18, 4:49:45 PM] Launchpad: lol I don't know if you'd call that a scam
[1/10/18, 4:49:57 PM] Launchpad: thats the way mining essentially works
[1/10/18, 4:50:21 PM] Miller: well its a scam if kodak says here buy this thing it has a 2 year payback on it
[1/10/18, 4:50:21 PM] Miller: and it doesnt
[1/10/18, 4:53:12 PM] Launchpad: I would imagine that contract is longer than one sentence
[1/10/18, 4:53:39 PM] Miller: i dont care about the contract details, if they advertise something and that is disingenious, it is a scam
[1/10/18, 4:53:57 PM] Justin: id also imagine if you had a rpoduct that prodcues automatic gains you woudlnt sell it
[1/10/18, 4:54:01 PM] Miller: if i advertise you a loan at 2% and in the fine print it says its 20% are you going to be like well okay guess i should have read it closer
[1/10/18, 4:54:20 PM] Miller: im sure you read all the T&C for itunes also right?
[1/10/18, 4:54:23 PM] Justin: assuming you have enough capital that is
[1/10/18, 4:54:26 PM] Launchpad: and if you can't figure out that the mining difficulty and payout rates are variable, you really shouldn't be getting into the mining business.  Its like buying a subway without knowing how to make a sandwich
[1/10/18, 4:54:49 PM] Miller: sure so maybe it should not be something that is mass marketed at idiots as a get-rich-quick scheme?
[1/10/18, 4:55:02 PM] Miller: her ma im getting into dat der bitcoin bizness
[1/10/18, 4:55:12 PM] Miller: the camera company sold me dis thing
[1/10/18, 4:55:16 PM] Miller: and its gonna print money
[1/10/18, 4:55:23 PM] Launchpad: was it marketed as a get-rich-quick scheme?
[1/10/18, 4:56:25 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 4:56:32 PM] Miller: #inmathwetrust
[1/10/18, 4:57:13 PM] Justin: also they have sold 300 of these...which assuming they cot literally nothing means koak made 1 million dollars?
[1/10/18, 4:57:17 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/10/18, 4:57:20 PM] Justin: why is that news?
[1/10/18, 4:57:23 PM] Launchpad: 1) it does say approximate earnings -- so that should at least tell you its not guaranteed
[1/10/18, 4:57:43 PM] Justin: "At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand," the rep explained.
[1/10/18, 4:58:00 PM] Miller: launchpad give me $5k and ill give you approximately 1k back/month for 2 yrs
[1/10/18, 4:58:00 PM] Miller: deal?
[1/10/18, 4:58:03 PM] Justin: so the supply side is having issues?  so when tehy really get this thing going it may make them a couple million dollars
[1/10/18, 4:58:52 PM] Justin: you should just agree with miller and say this is the important part " Kodak's move ‚Äì along with its plans to create a cryptocurrency that would form part of a digital rights management platform based on blockchain"
[1/10/18, 4:59:30 PM] Miller: i obviously dont give a fuck about kodak but to pretend this marketing for this is not (intentionally) misleading is absurd
[1/10/18, 4:59:46 PM] Launchpad: 1st sentence: "All values based on bitcoins values as of today's date. Payout ratios will change according to the volatility of bitcoin and will go either up or down"
[1/10/18, 5:00:13 PM] Miller: if they would have said based on market trends the monthly bitcoin mining payout should drop by 15%/month into perpetuity and ran the returns with that math? okay fine
[1/10/18, 5:00:25 PM] Justin: well that is intentionally misleading as it ignores fully the increase in cost of mining irrelevant of price of bitcoin
[1/10/18, 5:00:39 PM] Launchpad: I agree its a bit misleading
[1/10/18, 5:00:51 PM] Miller: very simply if you bought this thinking you were going to earn $275/mo, when you find out you will not, you will feel cheated
[1/10/18, 5:00:57 PM] Launchpad: I wouldn't call it a scam though
[1/10/18, 5:01:11 PM] Miller: congratulations that you happen to be a genius and would know better, im guessing this is not marketed to you
[1/10/18, 5:01:22 PM] Scott: cheese might.  #classaction
[1/10/18, 5:02:07 PM] Launchpad: anyways, the more important part of that news is the KodakCoin
[1/10/18, 5:02:52 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/10/18, 5:03:48 PM] Miller: a bankrupt company desperately doing anything to get their stock price higher is news why?
[1/10/18, 5:06:39 PM] Launchpad: more the part about them creating a "public ledger for image rights to ensure that photographers get paid for their work."
[1/10/18, 5:09:26 PM] Miller: yea good luck with that
[1/10/18, 5:14:10 PM] Launchpad: thats fine I'm still enjoying my "I WAS RIGHT" victory tour when I said its gong to be everywhere
[1/10/18, 5:15:19 PM] Miller: good news you can pay for almost as many things with I WAS RIGHT bucks as you can with bitcoin
[1/10/18, 5:16:00 PM] Launchpad: no actually you can't
[1/10/18, 5:16:15 PM] Miller: actually my statement is factually correct
[1/10/18, 5:16:16 PM] Launchpad: cause a bitcoin can be easily converted to 15k cash
[1/10/18, 5:16:29 PM] Launchpad: no its not
[1/10/18, 5:16:36 PM] Launchpad: you can pay for many things with bitcoin
[1/10/18, 5:17:05 PM] Miller: and you can pay for almost as many things with bragging rights
[1/10/18, 5:17:24 PM] Launchpad: nope, you cant
[1/10/18, 5:19:25 PM] Miller: less than 1/10th of 1% of businesses or companies or people worldwide accept bitcoin as payment
[1/10/18, 5:20:06 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/10/18, 5:21:29 PM] Launchpad: @16316620763 thats gold lol
[1/10/18, 5:22:54 PM] Brian Katz: Hookers,drugs,Assassins
[1/10/18, 5:24:17 PM] Launchpad: how many accept Apple stock as payment?
[1/10/18, 5:26:54 PM] Justin: ok so like apple is a poor form of currency you are saying bitcoin is as well?
[1/10/18, 5:27:09 PM] Launchpad: bitcoin is a great store of value
[1/10/18, 5:27:14 PM] Launchpad: it does many things
[1/10/18, 5:27:19 PM] Justin: no tis not its volatile as fuck
[1/10/18, 5:27:32 PM] Justin: and has been around for less than 5 years....thats not a great store of vlaue
[1/10/18, 5:27:31 PM] Launchpad: it makes insufferably annoying people rich
[1/10/18, 5:27:47 PM] Launchpad: actually its been around since2009
[1/10/18, 5:27:52 PM] Justin: it is a currency in the crypto market
[1/10/18, 5:27:54 PM] Justin: thats it
[1/10/18, 5:28:40 PM] Justin: so one could speculate the more widely accepted crypto becomes the less likely bitcoin is to hold that role
[1/10/18, 5:29:17 PM] Justin: as in if once people  start buying other cryptos with dollars and yen, wtf will the actual value of bicoin be?
[1/10/18, 5:30:02 PM] Launchpad: doesn't actually matter cause people will only become more interested in crypto as a whole and as a result they will become exponentially more annoying
[1/10/18, 5:30:30 PM] Launchpad: like if you think me trumping my own horn is annoying, wait til they be talking about the litecoin price around the water cooler
[1/10/18, 5:30:50 PM] Justin: lukcily no cooler in my aprtment, im fine
[1/10/18, 5:32:11 PM] Miller: i agree that bragging rights can only be used as a form of payment in slightly less places than aapl stock
[1/10/18, 5:32:53 PM] Justin: joia sent me this couple days ago

[1/11/18, 10:09:00 PM] Dan Watts: Was just talking to a friend about the Walmart Bonuses
[1/11/18, 10:09:14 PM] Dan Watts: Makes good headlines but given the tax breaks they're getting pathetic
[1/11/18, 10:09:36 PM] Justin: You can be most skeptical government spending person on the planet and still agree that government wouldn't have a waste rate of 99%
[1/11/18, 10:10:15 PM] Justin: Yeh. It's like we give 400 million and government loses 40 billion
[1/11/18, 10:10:42 PM] Justin: So it assumes the government only would have spent 400 million on jobs....think government can beat that
[1/11/18, 10:12:09 PM] Justin: Not to mention they already raised it to 9 in 2015 and 10 in 2016.

[1/12/18, 10:32:52 AM] Miller: idk renting out a garage for $8 and filling it with old propane tanks and charging people $200/mo probably gets you some pretty good margins
[1/12/18, 10:33:33 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah but you have to keep the feel if that in the parking lot too.

[1/12/18, 3:55:55 PM] Donk: yeah, basically its another high income tax break
[1/12/18, 3:56:02 PM] Donk: pretty nice for people who send their kids to private schools
[1/12/18, 4:01:38 PM] Launchpad: how do you think those kids feel?? they can't hang out with the poor kids without feeling like outcast
[1/12/18, 4:25:41 PM] Donk: you see the new chappelle special?

[1/12/18, 6:27:55 PM] Miller: I'm like yea I'm getting the fuck out of here, I plugged his router back in
[1/12/18, 6:28:25 PM] Donk: Lol, you just left the animal and blood there and bailed?
[1/12/18, 6:28:40 PM] Miller: What am I going to do?
[1/12/18, 6:30:57 PM] Launchpad: blood? Are you sure theres only one?
[1/12/18, 6:33:55 PM] Brian Katz: Call an exterminator?

[1/13/18, 12:21:08 PM] Brian Katz: Does this go both ways? Cause I can use a pity titty fuck from Kate upton.
[1/13/18, 12:23:43 PM] Brian Katz: Also why is it that in this day and age do we as a society have to lie? Like that lady is ugly and fat, not necessarily in that order. It‚Äôs rude to go out of my way to say that, but please to throw that shit in my face.
[1/13/18, 1:10:51 PM] Miller: I'm back at the scene of the crime with the exterminators
[1/13/18, 1:15:11 PM] Brian Katz: Who‚Äôs the perpetrator?
[1/13/18, 1:19:19 PM] Miller: Big fucking racoon he thinks
[1/13/18, 1:19:31 PM] Miller: I'm getting some pictures this time
[1/13/18, 1:19:58 PM] Launchpad: can you livestream it on your gopro??
[1/13/18, 1:20:05 PM] Launchpad: I would watch
[1/13/18, 1:20:26 PM] Miller: I don't have a go pro
[1/13/18, 1:33:36 PM] Miller: The guy said he's never seen anything like this
[1/13/18, 1:34:06 PM] Brian Katz: In what way?
[1/13/18, 1:34:15 PM] Miller: How much damage

[1/13/18, 1:44:30 PM] Miller: House was all clear now so I think they left, I probably scared them off last night tbh
[1/13/18, 1:44:35 PM] Miller: They're setting traps
[1/13/18, 1:46:30 PM] Brian Katz: They‚Äôre probably out gathering grub now, since it‚Äôs warm out.
[1/13/18, 1:46:43 PM] Miller: Na they're nocturnal
[1/13/18, 1:47:48 PM] Justin: wtf...why they raiding hte medicine cabinet lol
[1/13/18, 1:48:06 PM] Miller: Looking for some painkillers no doubt
[1/13/18, 1:48:06 PM] Brian Katz: For drugs
[1/13/18, 1:58:49 PM] Justin: how long they been gone?
[1/13/18, 1:59:03 PM] Miller: They were there last night
[1/13/18, 1:59:43 PM] Justin: i meant your parents

[1/13/18, 5:35:28 PM] Justin: On a bright note Chelsea manning running for senate in Maryland.

[1/13/18, 5:51:09 PM] Miller: Can anyone ELI5 the logic behind kicking when you win the coin toss?
[1/13/18, 5:53:52 PM] Justin: Hope to be better clock management team
[1/13/18, 5:54:05 PM] Justin: Or gives advantage to the better clock management team
[1/13/18, 5:55:46 PM] Justin: You aren't running out the clock in first half
[1/13/18, 5:55:49 PM] Justin: Almost ever
[1/13/18, 5:56:25 PM] Justin: So if you get ball first in 2nd half you can eat the last drive for 5 + minutes in theory
[1/13/18, 5:56:36 PM] Justin: And even out possession in first half.
[1/13/18, 5:57:08 PM] Justin: Worst case even if other team gets an extra 1st half possession, it's not gonna be a clock eating/killing possession
[1/13/18, 7:46:42 PM] Justin: https://twitter.com/tide/status/951940660499755008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fyc%2Fhtml%2Fembed-iframe-min.2d7621e2.html

[1/16/18, 10:30:08 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah the whole time I was hearing his accent lol
[1/16/18, 11:06:13 AM] Donk: i didnt like it nearly as much as the first one
[1/16/18, 11:06:40 AM] Donk: it suffered from too much of "its a sequal so we need to have more big names! and more explosions!"
[1/16/18, 11:06:43 AM] Donk: but it was still fun
[1/16/18, 11:06:56 AM] Donk: havent seen baby driver yet, but want tot  see it

[1/16/18, 11:11:19 AM] Miller: also neither here not there i watched the original blade runner in advance of planning on watching the new one and meh, i did not think that was very good but i imagine it is one of those movies like star wars where it relied so much on "amazing" at the time special fx that it doesnt age well
[1/16/18, 11:11:29 AM] Brian Katz: It should‚Äôve been called holocaust of the apes
[1/16/18, 11:12:01 AM] Miller: ill be honest i could barely keep track of who was who, b/c all those  apes w/the exception of the 1 orange flat faced guy mostly all look alike
[1/16/18, 11:12:03 AM] Miller: idk i wasnt into it
[1/16/18, 11:12:07 AM] Miller: it was also way too long
[1/16/18, 11:12:11 AM] Miller: i liked the previous 2
[1/16/18, 11:13:10 AM] Miller: def should watch foreigner and baby driver before any of those (well idk what american made is but fuck that movie also)
[1/16/18, 11:15:52 AM] Donk: i liked the first two ape movies, havent watched the third one yet
[1/16/18, 11:16:06 AM] Donk: i think that the first blade runner is very overrated
[1/16/18, 11:16:07 AM] Donk: the book is better
[1/16/18, 11:16:18 AM] Donk: and blade runner 2049 is the far superior movie imo
[1/16/18, 11:18:02 AM] Donk: though i will say that if you dont like the directors other movies (arrival, sicario, prisoners), you will also not like this one, its very much in his style
[1/16/18, 11:18:09 AM] Brian Katz: I didn‚Äôt like blade runner at first, but after I rewatched it, it was much better.
[1/16/18, 11:21:08 AM] Miller: i loved prisoners, i was meh on arrival and sicario
[1/16/18, 11:21:20 AM] Miller: i intend to watch 2049 at some point
[1/16/18, 11:21:49 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/16/18, 11:22:50 AM] Donk: i found prisoners to be extremely discomforting. so well done. it stuck with me for days afterwards
[1/16/18, 11:23:19 AM] Miller: same
[1/16/18, 11:23:38 AM] Miller: kind of movie i watched once and thought was incredible but now having kids i honestly dont think i could watch it again
[1/16/18, 11:24:03 AM] Donk: yeah, would def be way worse in that case
[1/16/18, 11:24:25 AM] Miller: i remember reading somewhere someone talking about not being able to watch certain movies post-kids and i totally discounted it at the time but that shit is rea
[1/16/18, 11:24:25 AM] Miller: real
[1/16/18, 11:24:56 AM] Donk: yeah, prisoners is probably the poster child for that idea
[1/16/18, 12:06:08 PM] James  L: 3rd you are crushing
[1/16/18, 12:06:28 PM] Miller: whoooooooo
[1/16/18, 12:06:33 PM] Miller: wrong chat lol

[1/16/18, 3:50:49 PM] Miller: Cuomo Says New York to Alter Tax Law to Thwart Federal Changes
Governor plans to replace state income tax with employer levy
Trump plan launched ‚Äòan economic missile‚Äô at N.Y., Cuomo saysBy¬†Henry Goldman
(Bloomberg) --¬†New York state would end income taxes on wage earners and make up the revenue with an employer payroll tax that‚Äôs federally deductible as part of a restructuring plan that Governor¬†Andrew Cuomo¬†is recommending to mitigate harmful effects of the new federal tax code.
The new federal law limits deductions for individuals‚Äô state and local taxes -- raising taxes 25 percent on all New Yorkers, no matter where they live, Cuomo said Tuesday. The federal changes could push residents and businesses out of state, the governor said as he presented a budget for the next fiscal year.
Andrew Cuomo
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything we can to thwart the effects of the federal plan,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúThis is going to be the most difficult challenge that we‚Äôve had to take on because it‚Äôs the most complicated, but I have no doubt that this is the fight of New York‚Äôs future.‚Äù
Earlier this month, Cuomo said his administration would file a lawsuit seeking to repeal the new federal tax law, arguing that it discriminates against states with high local and state taxes. In his budget speech, Cuomo for the first time fleshed out his plan to further reduce the impact of the federal law by changing the way the state taxes wage earners‚Äô income.
In the tax-overhaul legislation that President¬†Donald Trump¬†signed last month, the Republican controlled Congress cut income-tax rates on businesses and individuals across the board. But it also limited the deductions that individuals can take for state and local taxes -- including income and property levies -- to $10,000.
That so-called SALT provision is widely viewed as an attack on Democratic-leaning states, which tend to have higher taxes. On Tuesday, Cuomo called the SALT cap ‚Äú an economic missile‚Äù aimed at New York, which he said pays $48 billion more to the federal government than it gets back each year. The changes will add $14 billion more to that tally this year, Cuomo said.
New York‚Äôs ‚ÄòPenalty‚Äô
‚ÄúIt targets New York with a penalty,‚Äù he said. Overall, he said 12 states would be targeted by limiting the SALT deductions to help pay for other cuts. ‚ÄúCoincidentally, they all happen to be Democratic.‚Äù
In response, Cuomo said his proposal, which he dubbed the ‚ÄúNew York State Taxpayer Protection Act,‚Äù would eliminate the state income tax on wage earners. Instead, the state would levy a wage tax on the employer. By doing so, the tax burden would shift from workers -- who face new limits on their ability to deduct state income taxes -- to employers, who could still take full deductions for such payroll taxes. The legislation would spell out which kinds of companies would be eligible for this treatment.
‚ÄúIt may actually reduce the liability because it may bring the worker down to a lower income bracket,‚Äù Cuomo said.¬†
The plan would apply only to wage earners. For other sources of income -- including investment gains -- the state would continue to run its personal income tax system, Cuomo said. The state Department of Taxation will spell out more details Wednesday, he said.
Cuomo also said he intends to create state charitable funds for education and health care, which would allow individuals to get state tax credits for their donations. This would mitigate the impact of the federal tax plan on high income earners, he said.¬†California and New Jersey officials are considering similar proposals.
[1/16/18, 3:50:51 PM] Miller: its lit
[1/16/18, 3:52:48 PM] Donk: this may not help me actually since i work in jersey
[1/16/18, 3:58:34 PM] Miller: reason #193 working in NJ is not good
[1/16/18, 3:59:18 PM] Donk: what are the other 192 reasons?
[1/16/18, 3:59:43 PM] Miller: #1 is no left turns
[1/16/18, 3:59:49 PM] Miller: #2-192 will be saved for a future time

[1/16/18, 5:42:41 PM] Kiyoon: what if we both end up getting tickets
[1/16/18, 5:43:36 PM] Kiyoon: I guess my question before that is do we pay for it up front
[1/16/18, 5:46:49 PM] Miller: no
[1/16/18, 5:46:54 PM] Miller: all this does is register you for a lotto system
[1/16/18, 5:46:56 PM] Miller: to get a code
[1/16/18, 5:47:00 PM] Miller: which you can use to buy tickets
[1/16/18, 5:47:10 PM] Miller: takes ~30 seconds
[1/16/18, 5:47:16 PM] Miller: will get a text thursday in theory
[1/16/18, 5:47:18 PM] Kiyoon: word
[1/16/18, 5:47:29 PM] Kiyoon: I got you fam

[1/17/18, 10:29:25 AM] Kiyoon: https://www.facebook.com/TheCryptoBubble/videos/476956002705890/
[1/17/18, 10:31:27 AM] Miller: sad, theres apparently a whole bunch of people who had gambling addiction tendencies who did not know that they had problems until something like this happened
[1/17/18, 10:31:58 AM] Launchpad: lol dark times indeed
[1/17/18, 10:32:13 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 10:32:39 AM] Miller: yes clearly investing your life savings into something like this is stupid, still sad
[1/17/18, 10:32:44 AM] Miller: people gonna end up killing themselves
[1/17/18, 10:33:40 AM] Launchpad: That guy was an idiot cause it was well known with anyone with half a brain that BitConnect was a Ponzi Scheme
[1/17/18, 10:34:10 AM] Miller: could say the same thing about madoff
[1/17/18, 10:34:15 AM] Miller: greed blinds
[1/17/18, 10:35:06 AM] Kiyoon: what was the sell for bitconnect?
[1/17/18, 10:35:16 AM] Kiyoon: was it a platform or a coin
[1/17/18, 10:35:46 AM] Launchpad: thats different - we're talking a well known Wall St. Billionaire running a Ponzi masquerading as a legitimate fund
[1/17/18, 10:35:46 AM] Miller: some very confusing shit about lending them bicoins
[1/17/18, 10:36:15 AM] Launchpad: If you aren‚Äôt familiar with the platform, Bitconnect was an anonymously-run site where users could loan their cryptocurrency to the company in exchange for outsized returns depending on how long the loan was for. For example, a $10,000 loan for 180 days would purportedly give you ~40% returns each month, with a .20% daily bonus.

Bitconnect also had a thriving multi-level referral feature, which also made it somewhat akin to a pyramid scheme with thousands of social media users trying to drive signups using their referral code.

The platform said it generated returns for users using Bitconnnect‚Äôs trading bot and ‚Äúvolatility trading software‚Äù, which usually averaged around 1% per day.
[1/17/18, 10:36:59 AM] Kiyoon: oooo I see
[1/17/18, 10:37:45 AM] Miller: broadly speaking idea is the same, something that sounds too good to be true, but if you see people making $ off it and everyone is doing it and everyone is making $ off it you ignore all the warning signs
[1/17/18, 10:38:59 AM] Donk: damn, bitcoin under 10k now?
[1/17/18, 10:39:44 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[1/17/18, 10:51:30 AM] Miller: and the lending rates are way better (NOT A RED FLAG)
[1/17/18, 10:51:42 AM] Kiyoon: lolz
[1/17/18, 10:51:51 AM] Kiyoon: I am currently down 72% in my bitcoin investment
[1/17/18, 10:51:56 AM] Miller: how?
[1/17/18, 10:51:58 AM] Kiyoon: HODL
[1/17/18, 10:52:03 AM] Miller: didnt you buy in at 7k?

[1/17/18, 10:52:20 AM] Kiyoon: its ripple
[1/17/18, 10:52:22 AM] Kiyoon: tron
[1/17/18, 10:52:25 AM] Kiyoon: and mana
[1/17/18, 10:52:26 AM] Miller: should have cashed out to buy the ring tbh
[1/17/18, 10:52:36 AM] Kiyoon: I lost all the ring money
[1/17/18, 10:52:37 AM] Kiyoon: had to take out a loan to do that
[1/17/18, 10:52:43 AM] Miller: jfc
[1/17/18, 10:52:47 AM] Miller: i dont even know if you are kidding
[1/17/18, 10:52:50 AM] Kiyoon: I'm just kidding man
[1/17/18, 10:52:55 AM] Miller: my coworkers buddy invented this ripple
[1/17/18, 10:52:57 AM] Kiyoon: lol
[1/17/18, 10:52:58 AM] Miller: guys a billionare
[1/17/18, 10:53:05 AM] Kiyoon: really?
[1/17/18, 10:53:05 AM] Miller: still lost 1/2 his wealth
[1/17/18, 10:53:12 AM] Kiyoon: damn
[1/17/18, 10:53:24 AM] Miller: sort of a good news bad news situation
[1/17/18, 10:53:39 AM] Donk: tbh the dpereciation from when you buy the diamond to when you walk out the door is probably about 72% anyway, so you are about even
[1/17/18, 10:53:49 AM] Kiyoon: hahaha exactly
[1/17/18, 10:54:17 AM] Kiyoon: though if I "lose it" and claim insurance on it, that's a 100% profit
[1/17/18, 10:55:15 AM] Miller: apparently ppl all butthurt about this youtube guy cryptonick putting people into bitconnect and making $ off his affiliate links etc...
[1/17/18, 10:55:34 AM] Miller: im sorry if you take any financial advice from a 17 y/o on youtube you deserve to lose your $
[1/17/18, 10:56:32 AM] Launchpad: that guy could get in trouble if he knowingly recommended people to sign up for a ponzi
[1/17/18, 10:56:58 AM] Miller: seems impossible to prove
[1/17/18, 10:57:07 AM] Scott: Exact percentage there.
[1/17/18, 10:57:14 AM] Launchpad: Im willing to bet that you could look on any bitconnect video and half the users will say its a ponzi
[1/17/18, 10:57:30 AM] Launchpad: Ive heard it mentioned multiple times without even looking for it
[1/17/18, 10:57:32 AM] Miller: although what they did in madoff was they clawed back profits from anyone who made $ through it and re-distributed it to the losers
[1/17/18, 10:57:51 AM] Launchpad: thats why cryptonick might be in trouble
[1/17/18, 10:58:00 AM] Miller: so i guess something like that could happen, then the question would be does his affiliate $ count as "profit" or is that like service fee or w/e
[1/17/18, 10:58:07 AM] Miller: bc he didnt make that money from the bitconnect price going up
[1/17/18, 10:58:12 AM] Miller: idk, IANAL
[1/17/18, 10:58:23 AM] Launchpad: you are the total noob of crypto investing.  Did you get your picks from cnbc???
[1/17/18, 10:58:32 AM] Launchpad: Jesus ask me first if you want to buy a coin
[1/17/18, 10:59:00 AM] Donk: i thought you were a very experience bird lawyer?

[1/17/18, 11:03:02 AM] Launchpad: He would be up a lot of money if he did
[1/17/18, 11:03:12 AM] Launchpad: that yellow line is the BTC price, the green line is the USD price
[1/17/18, 11:03:12 AM] Donk: on a side note, tron legacy was dope, suprised they didnt make a sequel to it

[1/17/18, 11:03:31 AM] Donk: plot was just ok, but the visuals and soundtrack were amazing
[1/17/18, 11:03:59 AM] Miller: what is even the point of the BTC price lines?
[1/17/18, 11:04:13 AM] Launchpad: everything trades against btc
[1/17/18, 11:04:23 AM] Miller: yes but that in and of itself is volatile
[1/17/18, 11:04:34 AM] Miller: so doesnt seem like a great indicator of anything
[1/17/18, 11:04:35 AM] Kiyoon: I had bought TRON before all that plagarizing shit came out
[1/17/18, 11:04:39 AM] Miller: id rather just see it on a stable basis
[1/17/18, 11:04:53 AM] Kiyoon: whenever the ALIBABA execs were on board
[1/17/18, 11:04:53 AM] Launchpad: when you're trading alts, you need to know your performance against btc
[1/17/18, 11:05:38 AM] Launchpad: if your trading alts and your account goes from 5k to 10k thats great but if btc went from 5k to 15k then you actually didn't so so good

[1/17/18, 11:07:36 AM] Miller: his math makes no sense
[1/17/18, 11:07:40 AM] Miller: dont try to understand it
[1/17/18, 11:07:43 AM] Kiyoon: because everything is down
[1/17/18, 11:07:53 AM] Miller: hes down 10% on 7 coins
[1/17/18, 11:08:04 AM] Miller: 10 times 7 = 70%
[1/17/18, 11:08:04 AM] Launchpad: I literally sold my ripple a day or 2 before it shot up 20x
[1/17/18, 11:08:06 AM] Miller: simple maths
[1/17/18, 11:08:08 AM] Launchpad: annoyed with that one
[1/17/18, 11:08:15 AM] Kiyoon: lol
[1/17/18, 11:08:32 AM] Scott: Think I'm gonna buy litecoin if it dips below 140. What u think @16195657200
[1/17/18, 11:08:33 AM] Miller: @16195657200 ill charge you 1% on a loan until friday
[1/17/18, 11:08:36 AM] Miller: cant beat that
[1/17/18, 11:09:16 AM] Launchpad: lol its not a bad deal I just need instant cash -- I have cash in my TD account, not sure how long it will take to get to my bank
[1/17/18, 11:09:51 AM] Miller: ill send it via zelle
[1/17/18, 11:09:53 AM] Miller: takes minutes
[1/17/18, 11:10:25 AM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[1/17/18, 11:11:17 AM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 11:11:19 AM] Kiyoon: tron
[1/17/18, 11:11:22 AM] Launchpad: the difference between 2 weeks & 2 months is the difference between making money and losing money
[1/17/18, 11:11:40 AM] Launchpad: tron you bought at the top
[1/17/18, 11:12:05 AM] Launchpad: ripple you missed the top by a couple days
[1/17/18, 11:12:08 AM] Miller: and yet you wont pay me 1% to get in 2 days earlier
[1/17/18, 11:13:23 AM] Kiyoon: I mean we're talking about a $100 investment here
[1/17/18, 11:13:29 AM] Launchpad: sorry buddy, you got worked on tron & ripple -- expensive lesson, don't chase
[1/17/18, 11:13:36 AM] Kiyoon: and I am down to $28
[1/17/18, 11:13:37 AM] Kiyoon: lol
[1/17/18, 11:13:38 AM] Launchpad: well I guess not too expensive
[1/17/18, 11:13:41 AM] Miller: correction, not expensive lesson
[1/17/18, 11:13:44 AM] Kiyoon: no, thats why I dont really care
[1/17/18, 11:13:54 AM] Miller: yea i lost more $ on minnesota not kicking that stupid extra point
[1/17/18, 11:14:00 AM] Kiyoon: hahah
[1/17/18, 11:14:01 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/17/18, 11:14:12 AM] Miller: not sure what the lesson was there, but i def did not learn it
[1/17/18, 11:14:33 AM] Kiyoon: my buddies invested anywhere between 3-10K
[1/17/18, 11:14:38 AM] Kiyoon: so definitely a harsh one for them
[1/17/18, 11:14:46 AM] Launchpad: dont chase something after it goes up thousands of percent
[1/17/18, 11:14:58 AM] Miller: depends how rich your friends are
[1/17/18, 11:15:08 AM] Kiyoon: you're literally doing this
[1/17/18, 11:15:20 AM] Miller: boom
[1/17/18, 11:15:20 AM] Miller: roasted
[1/17/18, 11:15:29 AM] Kiyoon: you bought litecoin?
[1/17/18, 11:15:38 AM] Kiyoon: that went up thousands of percents
[1/17/18, 11:16:41 AM] Donk: are 99% of the poeple investing in crytocurrency chasing the 10000%+ returns?
[1/17/18, 11:17:04 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 11:17:07 AM] Miller: dis u kiyoon?
[1/17/18, 11:18:14 AM] Kiyoon: Eurpoean Kiyoon
[1/17/18, 11:18:32 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 11:19:10 AM] Miller: not often people sell something in order to buy more of it
[1/17/18, 11:19:16 AM] Donk: lol
[1/17/18, 11:19:18 AM] Miller: suppose there is a first for everything
[1/17/18, 11:32:33 AM] Launchpad: actually no I haven't I buy on dips
[1/17/18, 11:32:40 AM] Launchpad: sorry to be a dick
[1/17/18, 11:33:06 AM] Miller: bad PR, the only guy here who has listened to you and hes down 70%
[1/17/18, 11:33:13 AM] Launchpad: but you literally nailed the top on 2 pump & dumps
[1/17/18, 11:33:28 AM] Launchpad: I never said buy Ripple or Tron
[1/17/18, 11:33:34 AM] Launchpad: you want to know what to buy?? EOS
[1/17/18, 11:34:05 AM] Launchpad: EOS gonna kill Ethereum
[1/17/18, 11:34:23 AM] Miller: are ripple or tron not "coins" ?
[1/17/18, 11:34:28 AM] Miller: relax francesa
[1/17/18, 11:36:58 AM] Launchpad: "Bitcoin was $6,000 in mid-November and is $9,000 today...a rise of 50% in just 2 months!" #perspective
[1/17/18, 11:37:52 AM] Kiyoon: so every buy you have has been on a dip?
[1/17/18, 11:39:43 AM] Kiyoon: and to be fair to Scottie, I didn't buy anything on his advice, I have a separate bitcoin chat
[1/17/18, 11:39:54 AM] Miller: WITHOUT him?
[1/17/18, 11:39:55 AM] Miller: wow
[1/17/18, 11:40:02 AM] Kiyoon: hahah
[1/17/18, 11:40:19 AM] Kiyoon: but he right, a week makes a huge difference
[1/17/18, 11:40:30 AM] Kiyoon: took a week for money to clear and I missed out in the ripple boom
[1/17/18, 11:41:26 AM] Launchpad: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7r0ftz/cryptonick_is_deleting_all_of_his_bitconnect/
[1/17/18, 11:42:30 AM] Launchpad: you need some an upgrade on your brain trust
[1/17/18, 11:42:41 AM] Launchpad: they steered you wrong!
[1/17/18, 11:42:42 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/17/18, 11:43:44 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 11:44:03 AM] Launchpad: lolol
[1/17/18, 11:44:33 AM] Launchpad: heres the thing -- if you're going to chase the price, you need to get out quickly
[1/17/18, 11:44:45 AM] Launchpad: if you get in before the spike, then you don't have to worry about losing money
[1/17/18, 11:45:11 AM] Launchpad: people see the shiny rocket taking off and they chase it -- but this is crypto, there will be another rocket leaving the station in 10 minutes
[1/17/18, 11:46:35 AM] Kiyoon: right and you sell at the peak
[1/17/18, 11:46:42 AM] Kiyoon: easy peasy I should be a millionaire in a month
[1/17/18, 11:47:27 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/17/18, 11:47:55 AM] Launchpad: selling at the peak is the hard part
[1/17/18, 11:48:02 AM] Miller: all you have to do is subscribe  to launchpads weekly newsletter, only $499/month
[1/17/18, 11:48:19 AM] Miller: the whole braintrust can split it
[1/17/18, 11:48:26 AM] Launchpad: lolol
[1/17/18, 11:48:28 AM] Donk: *payable only in fiat
[1/17/18, 11:48:38 AM] Launchpad: ill take Litecoin
[1/17/18, 11:48:45 AM] Launchpad: no bitcoin its too slow and expensive
[1/17/18, 11:49:40 AM] Launchpad: at the end of the day, you want to buy quality tokens that have a reason for existing and are not the hype of the moment
[1/17/18, 11:50:19 AM] Launchpad: Ripple will at least stick around, buying Ripple wasn't a bad idea, buying it a week after it 10x-ed was a bad idea
[1/17/18, 11:50:45 AM] Launchpad: TRON no one knows all they have is a plagiarized whitepaper
[1/17/18, 11:56:00 AM] Kiyoon: so was it a bad idea to buy BTC at 5K?
[1/17/18, 11:56:29 AM] Kiyoon: and no one knows anything about how a coin or stock or investment will react
[1/17/18, 11:59:23 AM] Launchpad: it was when it broke though its old high as thats an extremely bullish sign
[1/17/18, 12:02:35 PM] Kiyoon: but within 2 months it skyrocketed up to 19K
[1/17/18, 12:03:42 PM] Kiyoon: I'm just trolling you at this point, cause you make it sound like its an exact easy science to trade

[1/17/18, 12:11:49 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 12:13:05 PM] Miller: cant wait for chapter 4: 
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later, that shit worth two million
Few years later, that shit worth eight million
[1/17/18, 12:13:28 PM] Miller: or  chapter 6: You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit
[1/17/18, 12:13:42 PM] Miller: and of course chapter 9: You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it
[1/17/18, 12:15:56 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[1/17/18, 12:16:43 PM] Dan Watts: No chapter on cryptos??? ü§î
[1/17/18, 12:34:40 PM] Launchpad: lmao
[1/17/18, 12:34:45 PM] Launchpad: what about weed stocks??
[1/17/18, 12:35:35 PM] Justin: This is kinda the issue
[1/17/18, 12:35:37 PM] Miller: big support @ 10k
[1/17/18, 12:35:42 PM] Launchpad: just takes patience, discipline & experience
[1/17/18, 12:38:08 PM] Launchpad: there is a natural instinct that when you see a price shooting up, you want to get on board cause of FOMO
[1/17/18, 12:38:59 PM] Launchpad: and you might think you're smart for a few weeks, but as soon as theres a correction, you end up getting burned
[1/17/18, 12:41:26 PM] Launchpad: btw im giving you a hard time, but its common mistakes every trader has made at some point.....now if you bought bitconnect I'd be giving you hell

[1/17/18, 1:59:15 PM] Launchpad: Which one
[1/17/18, 1:59:30 PM] Justin: Suicide hotline
[1/17/18, 2:21:41 PM] Brian Katz: So bitcoin crashed?
[1/17/18, 2:36:51 PM] Launchpad: corrected
[1/17/18, 2:36:59 PM] Launchpad: like it does every few months
[1/17/18, 2:44:38 PM] Brian Katz: Corrected so yes?
[1/17/18, 2:45:30 PM] Dan Watts: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 2:49:02 PM] Donk: lol
[1/17/18, 2:49:33 PM] Donk: crashed if you are hater, corrected if you are a fluffer
[1/17/18, 2:49:46 PM] Donk: (there is no middle ground lol)
[1/17/18, 3:01:05 PM] Dan Watts: Did you guys know Shad Khan owner of the Jags is a beta???
[1/17/18, 3:05:47 PM] Launchpad: bitcoin fortunes are built off the blood spilled by newbies
[1/17/18, 3:06:30 PM] Donk: that just makes it seem like a ponzi scheme
[1/17/18, 3:08:05 PM] Launchpad: lol no bitconnect is a ponzi scheme

[1/17/18, 3:19:40 PM] Tk: Must be those perfect genetics.
[1/17/18, 3:21:55 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 3:23:00 PM] Miller: lol if something going down 50% in < 1 week isnt a "crash" by any definition of the word then just lol
[1/17/18, 3:23:47 PM] Scott: HODL
[1/17/18, 3:24:05 PM] Miller: #Patriots QB Tom Brady is with medical staff and will not be available to the media today, the team announced.
[1/17/18, 3:24:06 PM] Miller: this seems less than ideal
[1/17/18, 3:24:10 PM] Miller: hopefully just mindgames
[1/17/18, 3:24:50 PM] Launchpad: I prefer to think that the term 'crash' is volatility based. Coca Cola falling 50% in a week is a crash.  For BTC, its a regular occurance
[1/17/18, 3:24:56 PM] Brian Katz: Always mindgamea
[1/17/18, 3:27:38 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 3:29:18 PM] Dan Watts: This dip is due to regulation in china and Korea
[1/17/18, 3:30:58 PM] Scott: @16313981203 your own ppl doing you in.
[1/17/18, 3:32:04 PM] Dan Watts: Warren Buffet recently said something to the effect of "I don't know anything about cryptocurrencies but I know it's not going to end well"
[1/17/18, 3:36:38 PM] Launchpad: Warren Buffet famously knows nothing and avoids tech
[1/17/18, 3:36:45 PM] Launchpad: **nothing about tech
[1/17/18, 3:36:51 PM] Miller: he knows cherry coke
[1/17/18, 3:36:59 PM] Miller: but i agree w/the fuck warren buffet sentiment
[1/17/18, 3:37:41 PM] Launchpad: I think its going to end well for a lot of people
[1/17/18, 3:39:00 PM] Miller: doesnt everything
[1/17/18, 3:39:42 PM] Launchpad: sign up for my newsletter and Ill make sure you stay out of bitconnect

[1/17/18, 4:15:40 PM] Miller: lmao
[1/17/18, 4:15:59 PM] Miller: should have been buying
[1/17/18, 4:16:04 PM] Miller: terrible advice LP
[1/17/18, 4:22:54 PM] Launchpad: yes its usually a better time to buy after something had an 80% correction than to buy after going up thousands of percent in a week
[1/17/18, 4:23:08 PM] Launchpad: especially when that thing is just a 10 billion dollar whitepaper
[1/17/18, 4:23:19 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/17/18, 4:23:40 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/17/18, 4:27:19 PM] Launchpad: @16313981203 you gotta get into EOS
[1/17/18, 4:30:23 PM] Miller: dont do it kiyoon, it has already gone up 1800%, if theres one thing i know its nobody should buy into something that has had a huge move
[1/17/18, 4:31:15 PM] Launchpad: lol it didnt happen in a week
[1/17/18, 4:31:33 PM] Launchpad: Disclaimer: I own EOS
[1/17/18, 4:32:52 PM] Launchpad: December 4.  Tron trading at .002c
[1/17/18, 4:34:45 PM] Launchpad: Also EOS has proven working concepts, TRON doesn't have anything yet
[1/17/18, 4:43:21 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 4:46:45 PM] Miller: as funny as i find all this, over/under 10 kids are gonna die from eating these
[1/17/18, 4:47:15 PM] Donk: survival of the fittest
[1/17/18, 4:58:42 PM] Brian Katz: I say under
[1/17/18, 4:59:08 PM] Launchpad: adults who bought bitconnect might also die from this
[1/17/18, 4:59:41 PM] Brian Katz: Are you eating tide Scotty?
[1/17/18, 4:59:52 PM] Miller: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/01/16/there-were-over-10000-poison-control-calls-for-people-eating-laundry-pods-last-year/?utm_term=.0b67706c11bf
[1/17/18, 4:59:57 PM] Donk: i have to guess that more than 10 kids already die a year from drinking tide or other deteregents
[1/17/18, 5:00:25 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 5:00:57 PM] Launchpad: I never bought bitconnect
[1/17/18, 5:02:08 PM] Miller: apparently theres videos of morons eating these, i just watched some
[1/17/18, 5:02:19 PM] Miller: this might be dumber than the set yourself on fire challenge
[1/17/18, 5:05:12 PM] Brian Katz: I think I‚Äôd rather eat tide than set myself in fire

[1/17/18, 5:45:41 PM] Launchpad: Times calling for an end to the bubble is a strong BUY signal https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/bitcoin-virtual-currency-bubble.html?partner=IFTTT
[1/17/18, 5:47:49 PM] Dan Watts: One piece of news surrounding crypto makes the value go up or down 20%
[1/17/18, 5:48:24 PM] Miller: well when that piece of news involved countries banning it, then yea
[1/17/18, 5:50:03 PM] Dan Watts: When News broke peter theil was invested in it 2 weeks ago went way up
[1/17/18, 5:50:30 PM] Dan Watts: Pretty obvious no one knows anything about the technology or what the actual consequences of regulation are
[1/17/18, 5:50:49 PM] Miller: lol no argument there
[1/17/18, 5:53:37 PM] Launchpad: nor do they bother to get the details straight
[1/17/18, 5:53:52 PM] Launchpad: although I know about the technology
[1/17/18, 5:53:58 PM] Launchpad: been saying for years to buy it
[1/17/18, 5:54:22 PM] Miller: usually just listen to someone who says grab their sack and buy and then buy some coins based on a 1982 scifi movie that may or may not be a complete fraud
[1/17/18, 5:54:40 PM] Launchpad: I never told anyone to buy TRON
[1/17/18, 5:54:53 PM] Miller: you said buy come coins
[1/17/18, 5:54:55 PM] Miller: tron is a coin
[1/17/18, 5:55:01 PM] Dan Watts: Idk way things are going you may have to return that t shirt @16318489683 got you
[1/17/18, 5:55:01 PM] Launchpad: ok wiseguy
[1/17/18, 5:55:43 PM] Brian Katz: Or I may need to update it

[1/17/18, 6:05:10 PM] Miller: Nope totally valid criticism
[1/17/18, 6:05:36 PM] Miller: I get annoyed when large people squeeze into the middle seat
[1/17/18, 6:05:44 PM] Miller: I'm almost never in a 2 seater
[1/17/18, 6:06:27 PM] Brian Katz: I got bent over the armrest, and he was sweating on me. Had to bail on my seat
[1/17/18, 6:08:33 PM] Miller: That's awkward

[1/17/18, 7:54:33 PM] Miller: I think you watch too much porn
[1/17/18, 7:55:17 PM] Launchpad: no i think they ready to suck a dick
[1/17/18, 8:00:47 PM] Justin: considering the show is about a guy who beats his wife because she looks like she wants it, and a girl who gets raped because she looks like she wants it.....would say your comment fits in pretty well with their view of men
[1/17/18, 8:01:28 PM] Justin: not even being critical of you for saying it, i think thats a pretty standard view of most men to sexualize everything
[1/17/18, 8:02:44 PM] Launchpad: what show?
[1/17/18, 8:03:21 PM] Justin: https://www.hbo.com/big-little-lies
[1/17/18, 8:04:46 PM] Justin: was a good show
[1/17/18, 8:04:58 PM] Scott: Great show. Another season coming up
[1/17/18, 8:05:27 PM] Justin: really?
[1/17/18, 8:05:39 PM] Scott: Yes. Really.
[1/17/18, 8:05:54 PM] Justin: funny a show can never be one and done these days
[1/17/18, 8:06:07 PM] Justin: tehy always build it like it is...never follow thorugh
[1/17/18, 8:07:56 PM] Justin: rooting for a night of season 2

[1/17/18, 8:19:54 PM] Launchpad: Can someone please send Arod to the tailor?
[1/17/18, 8:24:21 PM] Dan Watts: Get Katrina from men's warehouse San Diego on the phone
[1/17/18, 8:27:06 PM] Launchpad: Hahaha i have not texted her
[1/17/18, 8:27:12 PM] Dan Watts: Weak
[1/17/18, 8:31:24 PM] Miller: Should return the clothes, teach her a lesson
[1/17/18, 8:31:54 PM] Launchpad: For raping my wallet?
[1/17/18, 8:32:23 PM] Launchpad: She only took advantage of my own vanity, I can't fault her for that
[1/17/18, 8:41:08 PM] Miller: What's that saying? Behind every story of launchpad spending money on clothing there is a beautiful woman
[1/17/18, 8:51:51 PM] Launchpad: Beautiful is a stretch
[1/17/18, 8:52:05 PM] Miller: Attractive better?
[1/17/18, 8:55:02 PM] Launchpad: Stretch
[1/17/18, 8:55:15 PM] Launchpad: This was about me not her
[1/17/18, 9:22:58 PM] Launchpad: Go Trump?

[1/17/18, 9:28:26 PM] Launchpad: lolol
[1/17/18, 9:30:08 PM] Launchpad: not really feelin sundays lineup
[1/17/18, 9:30:22 PM] Launchpad: gonna stay sober and beat the rush home
[1/17/18, 9:32:24 PM] Miller: Would go to see big Shaq and xxxtentacion iwbh
[1/17/18, 9:33:07 PM] Launchpad: I know Im down on Sunday but I might stay for Avocado Toast
[1/17/18, 9:33:29 PM] Dan Watts: Idk how you can miss Logan Paul filming a dead guy, avocado toast or the mannequin challenge but suit yourself
[1/17/18, 9:33:39 PM] Dan Watts: Lmao
[1/17/18, 9:33:50 PM] Dan Watts: Knew you couldn't miss avocado toast
[1/17/18, 9:34:10 PM] Launchpad: I will also be front row for Gentrification
[1/17/18, 9:35:10 PM] Miller: I almost missed Bhad Babie
[1/17/18, 9:35:17 PM] Dan Watts: Ja Rule ft fyre festivalüî•üî•üî•
[1/17/18, 9:35:28 PM] Miller: Hope she performs These Heauxs
[1/17/18, 9:35:48 PM] Dan Watts: People saying bitcoin the next fyre festival
[1/17/18, 9:36:22 PM] Miller: I've heard that
[1/17/18, 9:36:25 PM] Launchpad: they sayin EOS the next EDC
[1/17/18, 9:36:48 PM] Miller: EOS more like EOL amirite?
[1/17/18, 9:37:01 PM] Launchpad: no...
[1/17/18, 9:37:17 PM] Launchpad: everything bounced hard so if you guys missed the dip, thats it
[1/17/18, 9:37:37 PM] Launchpad: maybe you'll get another chance in 8 months or so?
[1/17/18, 9:37:45 PM] Miller: Oh well, always next 50 percent not crash
[1/17/18, 9:38:35 PM] Launchpad: after a crash everyone goes home. You don't have them all lining up to buy more
[1/17/18, 9:39:00 PM] Dan Watts: Depends on how good the stuff is
[1/17/18, 9:39:06 PM] Miller: Which is why the stock market never recovered from 1929
[1/17/18, 9:39:09 PM] Miller: Or 2000
[1/17/18, 9:39:12 PM] Miller: Or 2008
[1/17/18, 9:39:18 PM] Miller: Because everyone went home
[1/17/18, 9:39:54 PM] Launchpad: went into a bear market
[1/17/18, 9:40:03 PM] Launchpad: we are not yet in crypto bear market
[1/17/18, 9:40:07 PM] Launchpad: if we are Ill concede
[1/17/18, 9:40:27 PM] Miller: You're so sensitive to the word crash, any rational person would consider a 50 percent drop a crash
[1/17/18, 9:40:49 PM] Miller: If my house value got cut in half I would say the housing market crashed
[1/17/18, 9:41:07 PM] Launchpad: what I see is strong buying amidst large tax cuts and an economy firing on all cylinders
[1/17/18, 9:41:07 PM] Miller: Actually it went down about 30 percent on average and people called it a crash
[1/17/18, 9:41:21 PM] Launchpad: a sharp bounce back in prices after this recent 50 percent correction
[1/17/18, 9:41:42 PM] Miller: Something bouncing back doesn't mean it didn't crash
[1/17/18, 9:41:47 PM] Miller: Home prices bounced back
[1/17/18, 9:41:53 PM] Miller: Stock market bounced back
[1/17/18, 9:42:48 PM] Launchpad: Fine, maybe we can define a 'crash' as the granularity of the chart your looking at
[1/17/18, 9:43:11 PM] Miller: You can define it however you want, just know it's not how the rest of the world does
[1/17/18, 9:43:15 PM] Launchpad: Stock market and home prices bounced back on the yearly chart, and in earth time thats a long fucken time
[1/17/18, 9:43:28 PM] Launchpad: whats the definition of a crash?
[1/17/18, 9:44:34 PM] Miller: Obviously the subjectivity of it makes it impossible to pinpoint but I think overwhelmingly people would consider anything that fell 50 percent to be a crash
[1/17/18, 9:44:50 PM] Miller: You are free to call it a correction or whatever you want
[1/17/18, 9:47:29 PM] Launchpad: I think overwhelmingly, but not quite consciously -- people would attribute the volatility of the underlying into their idea of the difference between a crash and correction
[1/17/18, 9:51:40 PM] Justin: i love rewarding corporations for cheating taxes rinse repeat every ten years...its great
[1/17/18, 9:56:41 PM] Justin: lol yeh the tax cuts drove the bitcoin price
[1/17/18, 9:57:41 PM] Justin: also firing on all cylinders....what does that even mean its been firing for 8 years, id be nervous of a correction
[1/17/18, 9:58:14 PM] Justin: like idk the biggest supplier of american goods getting into a war
[1/17/18, 9:58:25 PM] Justin: sure market would love that
[1/17/18, 9:58:25 PM] Launchpad: what you call 'cheating taxes' I call playing within the written rules that allow you to avoid paying the higher tax rate at home by leaving money overseas
[1/17/18, 9:58:44 PM] Justin: yeh and who writes that tax code?
[1/17/18, 9:59:07 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/17/18, 9:59:22 PM] Justin: he didnt write the loopholes
[1/17/18, 9:59:27 PM] Justin: just the asshole letting them cash in on them
[1/17/18, 9:59:38 PM] Justin: could as easily have been obama
[1/17/18, 9:59:43 PM] Justin: almost was in 2014
[1/17/18, 9:59:45 PM] Justin: but they voted it down
[1/17/18, 10:00:10 PM] Launchpad: I think what you are referring to as 'loopholes' are what is known as 'rules'
[1/17/18, 10:00:42 PM] Justin: literally doesnt change my point
[1/17/18, 10:00:52 PM] Justin: unless the people who wrote them somehow arent the same
[1/17/18, 10:01:52 PM] Launchpad: I don't know what you're talking about.  But I do know that even though I don't like Trump, I find it funny watching people squirm around when you remind them of something good going on right now.
[1/17/18, 10:01:57 PM] Justin: i mean at least you have some gorund to stand on here
[1/17/18, 10:02:22 PM] Justin: im not gonna argue market econmics with you, we hav ecompletely different opinions on it
[1/17/18, 10:03:15 PM] Justin: good lol
[1/17/18, 10:03:18 PM] Miller: Isn't that generally what causes an argument? Don't see a lot of people arguing who have the sake opinions
[1/17/18, 10:03:29 PM] Miller: Same
[1/17/18, 10:03:49 PM] Miller: Got hibachi on my mind (and keyboard)
[1/17/18, 10:04:09 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/17/18, 10:04:35 PM] Miller: Fair but still underlying disagreement
[1/17/18, 10:04:47 PM] Launchpad: lol true
[1/17/18, 10:05:20 PM] Launchpad: if no disagreement shall exist, find one
[1/17/18, 10:05:42 PM] Launchpad: but you can't shares of Apple
[1/17/18, 10:06:55 PM] Miller: You malfunctioning?
[1/17/18, 10:07:54 PM] Launchpad: lol meant to say Eat shares of Apple
[1/17/18, 10:08:43 PM] Miller: People out here eating laundry detergent pods goddamn believe I could eat some shares of apple
[1/17/18, 10:09:17 PM] Launchpad: well you're too fucken lazy to get the certificate printed out in your name
[1/17/18, 10:09:47 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 10:09:52 PM] Justin: just as likely to eat shares of apple as buy shit with coins
[1/17/18, 11:04:03 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pJlpCfueV0&feature=youtu.be
[1/17/18, 11:50:17 PM] Justin: Xbox controller
[1/17/18, 11:50:40 PM] Brian Katz: Lol I just saw that
[1/17/18, 11:51:34 PM] Launchpad: reminds of the olden BU days when I just met @16316620763  and he give me his bowl and ran off üòÇüòÇ

[1/18/18, 12:02:27 AM] Justin: Btw @17189742074 your favorite guy came out in support of Cory booker
[1/18/18, 12:03:15 AM] Justin: Now I got something to dislike about him. I'm all aboard the hate train
[1/18/18, 4:50:19 AM] Miller: Changes it to Xbox card mid story
[1/18/18, 9:41:37 AM] Miller: well now i really regret watching blade runner b/c i only did so b/c i wanted to watch the new one, the new one was terrible, boring 3 hours
[1/18/18, 9:41:46 AM] Miller: all things considered maybe one of the worst movies ive ever seen
[1/18/18, 9:42:18 AM] Miller: like sure leatherface was terrible, but its a shitty 90 min horror movie w/no actors youve ever heard of in it, you watch some ppl get murdered and you forget it ever existed
[1/18/18, 9:42:53 AM] Donk: i loved the new blade runner
[1/18/18, 9:43:04 AM] Donk: easily one of the best movies of 2017
[1/18/18, 9:43:13 AM] Miller: the best part was when it ended
[1/18/18, 9:43:29 AM] Miller: i legitimately considered bailing mid-movie which i dont think i have ever done before in my life
[1/18/18, 9:43:45 AM] Miller: i cared that little about what was going on
[1/18/18, 9:46:00 AM] Donk: first of all, it is all time beautiful movie regarding the visuals and how its shot
[1/18/18, 9:46:09 AM] Donk: just spectacular really
[1/18/18, 9:46:35 AM] Miller: thats shit people say about boring movies
[1/18/18, 9:46:37 AM] Donk: second of all, if you were looking for a sci-fi shoot em up film like the 5th element, this was not that movie
[1/18/18, 9:46:43 AM] Miller: the cinematography was truly outstanding
[1/18/18, 9:46:50 AM] Launchpad: was looking for TRON
[1/18/18, 9:47:01 AM] Miller: i should have watched tron
[1/18/18, 9:47:43 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/18/18, 9:48:10 AM] Miller: pretty sure you told him to sell that yesterday?
[1/18/18, 9:49:52 AM] Launchpad: well I didn't specifically say to sell it yesterday, more just ripped into him for buying it
[1/18/18, 9:52:35 AM] Justin: watched this yesterday, had been a while
[1/18/18, 9:55:39 AM] Justin: what are you trying to tell him?
[1/18/18, 9:56:27 AM] Miller: should have ignored LP and quadrupled down at the bottom yest
[1/18/18, 9:56:36 AM] Miller: kiyoon could be up tens of dollars this morning
[1/18/18, 9:56:45 AM] Launchpad: i told all of you to buy yesterday
[1/18/18, 9:57:09 AM] Justin: you said dont buy coins that are hype and told everyone that tron plagerized their whitepaper
[1/18/18, 9:57:11 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/18/18, 9:57:17 AM] Launchpad: yeah that
[1/18/18, 9:57:25 AM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/18/18, 9:59:29 AM] Justin: so your portfoilio made what most portfolios dont make in 3 years in one day....you better have fuck you money
[1/18/18, 10:01:29 AM] Miller: kiyoon still down $20, has fuck you launchpad money
[1/18/18, 10:01:30 AM] Miller: does that count?
[1/18/18, 10:01:43 AM] Launchpad: I wouldn't say I have necessarily have fuck you money but I do have fuck @16316620763 money üí∏üí∏üí∏
[1/18/18, 10:02:00 AM] Justin: fuck at justin money comes pretty cheap
[1/18/18, 10:02:13 AM] Justin: much rather have fuck you mone
[1/18/18, 10:02:18 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/18/18, 10:02:22 AM] Launchpad: me too
[1/18/18, 10:02:57 AM] Launchpad: so lets let this bull keep kickin and trump keep trumpin'
[1/18/18, 10:03:20 AM] Brian Katz: So I hear that crypto is back on the rise?
[1/18/18, 10:04:50 AM] Justin: just take trump out of the equation and im down....even if you believe in trickle down economics, he doesn't
[1/18/18, 10:04:50 AM] Launchpad: like a zombie in a bad horror movie
[1/18/18, 10:04:57 AM] Launchpad: where the villian keeps winning
[1/18/18, 10:05:12 AM] Launchpad: I just made the trump statement to mess with you
[1/18/18, 10:07:00 AM] Justin: fair enough, its more of a different kind of trigger
[1/18/18, 10:07:14 AM] Justin: its like bill clinton getting credit for tech boom
[1/18/18, 10:07:23 AM] Launchpad: my job is to hype up this bull until it all explodes in a blaze of glory
[1/18/18, 10:07:43 AM] Miller: liberal dose of salt
[1/18/18, 10:07:52 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/18/18, 10:07:56 AM] Justin: bernie only president that could have an actual effect on market
[1/18/18, 10:08:27 AM] Launchpad: BUY https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/salt/
[1/18/18, 10:08:43 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/18/18, 10:08:43 AM] Justin: what about cake coins?
[1/18/18, 10:09:30 AM] Launchpad: how does trump not get credit for tax cuts which corporations have used to immediately announce the repatriation (and tax payment) of money over seas??
[1/18/18, 10:10:07 AM] Justin: because he has nothing to do with any actual policy in his whitehouse?
[1/18/18, 10:10:36 AM] Miller: i do think he should get "credit" for it
[1/18/18, 10:10:50 AM] Miller: bc he gets blamed for everything most of which he also likely has no input on
[1/18/18, 10:11:19 AM] Miller: i use airquotes b/c im not sure a transfer payment from individuals to corporates while exploding the debt is really a great thing for this country
[1/18/18, 10:11:32 AM] Justin: well he should maybe be honest and say the stock amrket will love this, instead of workers will get raises
[1/18/18, 10:11:49 AM] Launchpad: workers have been getting raises
[1/18/18, 10:11:53 AM] Justin: lol
[1/18/18, 10:12:04 AM] Justin: sure they have
[1/18/18, 10:12:07 AM] Launchpad: a few walmart workers lol
[1/18/18, 10:12:35 AM] Justin: yeh employee at walmart for over 20 years got a 1k one time bonus
[1/18/18, 10:12:45 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/18/18, 10:12:49 AM] Justin: corporate propaganda is some next level shit these days
[1/18/18, 10:13:08 AM] Launchpad: I just enjoy pointing out the double standard and watching people squirm rather than give the president credit cause they hate him.  Republicans could not ever admit when Obama did anything right either
[1/18/18, 10:13:17 AM] Justin: but thats the plan..they bankrupt government and cut social security and medicare medicaide
[1/18/18, 10:13:28 AM] Justin: what double standard?
[1/18/18, 10:13:35 AM] Justin: i think your missing the point
[1/18/18, 10:13:39 AM] Miller: yea none of this is getting reinvsted into employees that was stupid, all companies did was publicize their usual year end "christmas" bonuses and credit tax reform with them
[1/18/18, 10:13:59 AM] Miller: to the extent any of the employees benefit from higher stock prices could help indirectly
[1/18/18, 10:14:06 AM] Miller: but likely relatively small % in the grand scheme
[1/18/18, 10:14:11 AM] Justin: i mean this happens every 15 years
[1/18/18, 10:14:32 AM] Justin: rinse repeat, stock buybacks, avoid paying taxes rinse repeat stock buybacks
[1/18/18, 10:14:34 AM] Launchpad: For me personally I get my bonus on Friday
[1/18/18, 10:14:51 AM] Miller: im sure it will be much bigger b/c of tax reform
[1/18/18, 10:14:54 AM] Miller: i await the press release
[1/18/18, 10:15:03 AM] Launchpad: I make more money in the markets than my work bonus so Im ok with the stock market imparct
[1/18/18, 10:15:25 AM] Justin: congrats 90% of america doesnt though
[1/18/18, 10:15:45 AM] Justin: so thats kind of a double standard you are implying
[1/18/18, 10:15:49 AM] Launchpad: I would rather the markets continue plow higher than get a 3% raise / 3% bonus
[1/18/18, 10:16:09 AM] Launchpad: 90% of America makes all these shit excuses for why they don't save money
[1/18/18, 10:16:21 AM] Justin: yeh stock buybacks are a sustainable investment practice
[1/18/18, 10:16:37 AM] Justin: its not like you need wages to rise to allow  people to buy goods anymore
[1/18/18, 10:16:48 AM] Launchpad: stocks, weed stocks, crypto -- they're all melting up
[1/18/18, 10:16:58 AM] Justin: when you could just artifically pump up demand and stock prices
[1/18/18, 10:17:02 AM] Launchpad: so Im going to take advantage and make out like a bandit while I can
[1/18/18, 10:17:03 AM] Miller: lol crypto isnt melting anywhere
[1/18/18, 10:17:26 AM] Miller: nothing about the moves in crypto (or probably weed stocks) is slow
[1/18/18, 10:17:31 AM] Miller: the market is absolutely melting up
[1/18/18, 10:17:31 AM] Justin: ill give you that...if you get some fuck you money from crypto well done
[1/18/18, 10:18:19 AM] Launchpad: melting up doesn't imply slow -- the opposite in fact
[1/18/18, 10:19:41 AM] Launchpad: as long as people keep saying the markets are too high, theres going to be a selloff, im taking money off the table, blah blah blah
[1/18/18, 10:19:50 AM] Launchpad: Im going to keep buying and run it up to the sky
[1/18/18, 10:20:28 AM] Launchpad: Call me Paul Fucken Revere I'm going to ride around on my group chat horse proclaiming "The Markets are Going Higher!!"
[1/18/18, 10:22:09 AM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/18/18, 10:22:56 AM] Miller: fair enough but nothing about crypto is considered a melt up
[1/18/18, 10:23:17 AM] Justin: feel like you would have slit your wrists if you were born 20 years earleir
[1/18/18, 10:23:32 AM] Launchpad: what what you consider to be a melt up?
[1/18/18, 10:24:07 AM] Launchpad: If I was born 20 years earlier I'd be a lot fucken richer cause my money would have 20 years longer to compound
[1/18/18, 10:25:03 AM] Launchpad: if it takes around 7 years to double your money, an extra 20 years means I would have about 8x money in my retirement accounts
[1/18/18, 10:25:40 AM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>

[1/18/18, 10:27:46 AM] Launchpad: You can complain all you want about the rich and greedy corporations.. But the fact is this: you don't want to get rich the fast way, and you don't want to get rich the slow way. You want those who you consider to be greedy to give away more of their money
[1/18/18, 10:28:03 AM] Launchpad: ANYONE can get slowly rich
[1/18/18, 10:28:04 AM] Justin: yup thats it

[1/18/18, 10:30:31 AM] Justin: nexxt quetion if taxes are so bad, why did you move to the highest taxed state in america for employment?
[1/18/18, 10:31:39 AM] Justin: 3rd question if raising min wage is so bad, why did the home of the only productive part of the american economy, raise the min wage to 15$ first
[1/18/18, 10:31:51 AM] Donk: come on herm, this is an easy answer. San Diego has Taco Tuesday
[1/18/18, 10:32:16 AM] Launchpad: 1) not to pay higher taxes

[1/18/18, 11:27:10 AM] Kiyoon: that's a decent amount
[1/18/18, 11:27:14 AM] Kiyoon: have you ever heard of the app GetUpside?
[1/18/18, 11:27:22 AM] Donk: no, what is it?
[1/18/18, 11:27:46 AM] Kiyoon: I just downloaded it and gonna try it out, but it takes anywhere between like 10-20 cents off per gallon
[1/18/18, 11:28:10 AM] Kiyoon: so its sort of like ebates, where you get the gas on your CC and then just upload the receipt
[1/18/18, 11:29:35 AM] Kiyoon: I just sent you my referal code, you get 20 cents off a gallon your first purchase or something
[1/18/18, 11:29:45 AM] Miller: MLM SCAM!
[1/18/18, 11:29:50 AM] Kiyoon: hahah
[1/18/18, 11:29:58 AM] Miller: @cryptokiyoon
[1/18/18, 11:30:08 AM] Kiyoon: also seems to have cashback on restaurants and groceries
[1/18/18, 11:30:34 AM] Miller: how do they make $?

[1/18/18, 11:30:45 AM] Kiyoon: I have no idea how they make money
[1/18/18, 11:30:53 AM] Miller: yea thats a problem
[1/18/18, 11:30:55 AM] Kiyoon: nor do I care as long as I am getting money back and not giving them money lol
[1/18/18, 11:31:08 AM] Miller: i mean obviously thats fine
[1/18/18, 11:31:12 AM] Miller: but doesnt bode well for sustainability
[1/18/18, 11:31:25 AM] Kiyoon: How does ebates make money?
[1/18/18, 11:31:31 AM] Miller: idk what ebates is
[1/18/18, 11:31:37 AM] Launchpad: by raising more money from investors
[1/18/18, 11:31:55 AM] Kiyoon: ebates is also an app or extension on your browser
[1/18/18, 11:32:00 AM] Miller: Ebates is an affiliate to over 2,000 stores. When someone clicks on an Ebates link to a retail store, Ebates get a commission. Ebates gives you half of their commission (via cash back
[1/18/18, 11:32:01 AM] Kiyoon: say you buy something from macys
[1/18/18, 11:32:09 AM] Miller: google answered it easily in 1 second
[1/18/18, 11:32:19 AM] Kiyoon: thats probably how getupside does it
[1/18/18, 11:32:29 AM] Launchpad: lol
[1/18/18, 11:32:36 AM] Launchpad: I did a phone interview at Ebates
[1/18/18, 11:32:41 AM] Kiyoon: theres like 5 gas stations within a 4 block radius around me and theres only 2 of the gas stations that have cash back
[1/18/18, 11:32:47 AM] Miller: you said you just buy gas and then upload them a receipet?
[1/18/18, 11:32:51 AM] Miller: or am i not getting it
[1/18/18, 11:33:02 AM] Kiyoon: yeah
[1/18/18, 11:33:06 AM] Kiyoon: I think, I havent done it yet
[1/18/18, 11:33:15 AM] Miller: so how are they earning comission on that after-the-fact
[1/18/18, 11:33:20 AM] Launchpad: btw did anyone watch the Gronk TidePod PSA??
[1/18/18, 11:33:29 AM] Miller: of course
[1/18/18, 11:33:37 AM] Miller: pretty sure that got posted here multiple times, could be wrong
[1/18/18, 11:34:24 AM] Kiyoon: The app is free to download, and the startup makes money as a percentage of the incremental profit that the gas station. ‚ÄúOnly when they make more profit than they made today do we make money,‚Äù
[1/18/18, 11:34:26 AM] Donk: whitle i do apprecaite the link
[1/18/18, 11:34:33 AM] Donk: just went on their website and there is nothing near me at all
[1/18/18, 11:34:43 AM] Kiyoon: damn really?
[1/18/18, 11:34:48 AM] Donk: ind the best gas prices near you in DC, MD and VA. Select a local gas station or use search to find cheap gas nearby. Then, download the GetUpside app to get these deals.
[1/18/18, 11:34:52 AM] Kiyoon: stop living int he boonies donk
[1/18/18, 11:34:56 AM] Kiyoon: welp
[1/18/18, 11:34:56 AM] Donk: i think it might only be in your area
[1/18/18, 11:35:01 AM] Kiyoon: sorry guys
[1/18/18, 11:35:22 AM] Donk: but i can forward it to my sister and brother in law
[1/18/18, 11:35:36 AM] Kiyoon: its pretty sweet though, it gives like 10% cashback for groceries at the place I shop at
[1/18/18, 11:35:38 AM] Kiyoon: yeah thats cool
[1/18/18, 11:37:48 AM] Donk: the nice part about working in jersey is that i can still get the cheaper gas (and not pump it myself), though that recent NJ tax hike def closed the gap between NJ and NY so its not nearly as much of a discount
[1/18/18, 11:42:08 AM] Miller: the oregon-switching-from-full-to-self service gas was amazing
[1/18/18, 11:42:52 AM] Miller: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know HOW to pump gas and I am 62, native Oregonian ‚Ä¶ I say NO THANKS! I don‚Äôt want to smell like gasoline!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived in this state all my life and I REFUSE to pump my own gas ‚Ä¶ This a service only qualified people should perform. I will literally park at the pump and wait until someone pumps my gas.‚Äù

‚ÄúI go to work at 5 in the morning. Not a lot of people at the gas pumps at that time in the morning. And yes, I will not feel safe pumping my own gas ‚Ä¶ Not to mention it‚Äôs freezing and rainy. So thank you to all who voted to change it. You have now taken away a nice luxury that most of us enjoyed.‚Äù

‚ÄúMany people are not capable of knowing how to pump gas and the hazards of not doing it correctly. Besides I don‚Äôt want to go to work smelling of gas when I get it on my hands or clothes. I agree Very bad idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúYuck! Pumping my [own] fuel in freezing temperatures and handling a nasty ole fuel nozzle that 50 other people have touched that day (and who knows what cooties are on there), no thank you. It‚Äôs nice to not have to pump your own fuel.‚Äù

[1/18/18, 11:46:24 AM] Donk: apparently so many people drive off with the pumps still in their cars (in all states, not just oregon), that they all have the quick release valves lol
[1/18/18, 12:03:28 PM] Kiyoon: in all fairness I think these are the pumps where you can do both sides of vehicle
[1/18/18, 12:03:53 PM] Kiyoon: though guy on the right is probably parked too forward
[1/18/18, 12:04:17 PM] Donk: thats a thing? ive never seen it before
[1/18/18, 12:04:32 PM] Justin: Jersey has it on turnpike
[1/18/18, 12:04:47 PM] Kiyoon: I have rarely seen it but it's a thing
[1/18/18, 12:04:48 PM] Kiyoon: longer hoses
[1/18/18, 12:05:06 PM] Justin: Yeh definitely a thing. Still don't trust it, but a thing
[1/18/18, 12:05:06 PM] Donk: really? strange that ive never seen it before
[1/18/18, 12:05:46 PM] Justin: Also maybe this company promotes certain gas stations so they do get a commission?  Could also be collecting data for gas companies
[1/18/18, 12:08:17 PM] Miller: my understanding from what kiyoon wrote is these guys make an agreement w/a gas station to promote them, if these guys see an increase in profits vs some "normal" benchmark that gets attributed to this promotion and that "extra" profit is split b/w the gas station and the company, then in turn the company takes their share and splits it again w/everyone who uploaded a receipt for that gas station

[1/18/18, 2:15:36 PM] Miller: CUOMO PROPOSES 17% 'FAIRNESS FIX' TO EASE U.S. TAX PLAN IMPACT
(The following press release from the New York State Governor's Office was received by e-mail and was reformatted. The sender verified the statement.)

For Immediate Release: 1/18/2018

GOVERNOR ANDREW M. CUOMO

GOVERNOR CUOMO ANNOUNCES MAJOR STEP IN CLOSING CARRIED INTEREST LOOPHOLE WITH NEW "FAIRNESS FIX" TO ENSURE JUSTICE FOR NEW YORK TAXPAYERS

Governor's Proposal Could Raise More Than $1 Billion Annually

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced legislation to close the carried interest loophole, deliver fairness to all New York taxpayers, and help alleviate the impacts of the Trump administration's federal tax plan. This proposal will fix and equalize the tax treatment of income for private equity investors. Currently, investors pay lower tax rates than ordinary New Yorkers on their income by way of the carried interest loophole. The "Fairness Fix" could raise nearly $1.1 billion annually.

"While the federal government stacks the deck in favor of the wealthy and corporations at the expense of the middle class, we are taking action to protect hardworking New Yorkers and ensure fairness and equality," Governor Cuomo said. "Closing this egregious loophole will further this administration's efforts to promote economic justice and establish a fair tax code for working men and women across New York."

Under current federal law, a portion of income earned by hedge fund managers, private equity investors, venture capitalists and certain real estate investors - known as carried interest - is treated as capital gains, rather than as ordinary income. As a result, this income is afforded favorable tax treatment in the form of lower capital gains tax rates. This loophole costs the state approximately $100 million every year.

To ensure justice for New York taxpayers and take proactive measures to fight back against the federal government's tax plan, the Governor has proposed legislation that would treat this hedge fund compensation as ordinary income for state tax purposes. The legislation would also impose a "Fairness Fix" to close the carried interest loophole under New York State's tax code. By imposing a 17 percent "Fairness Fix," every hedge fund manager working in New York State - including those living outside of the state - will be required to pay their fair share and losses under the federal tax code will be compensated. This proposal could raise nearly $1.1 billion annually and help ease the impacts of the federal tax plan.

The legislation puts forward a comprehensive, regional approach to addressing the carried interest issue, taking effect only if Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania enact legislation having substantially the same effect as this bill.

[1/18/18, 2:17:14 PM] Miller: im here for it
[1/18/18, 2:17:29 PM] Justin: was gonna say if nj doesnt just join in
[1/18/18, 2:17:40 PM] Miller: would be nice to get some more detail on how it is going to help
[1/18/18, 2:17:45 PM] Donk: nj loves taxing people, im sure they will join
[1/18/18, 2:17:48 PM] Justin: than jersey city real estate in for another ride up
[1/18/18, 2:18:49 PM] Justin: gues sit doesnt amtter if its city tax and they can tax you for working in city
[1/18/18, 2:19:52 PM] Donk: state tax, but yeah
[1/18/18, 2:20:37 PM] Donk: right now you only pay the city tax if you live there, regardless of where you work
[1/18/18, 2:20:43 PM] Justin: yeh was gonna be the next comment out of my head...but yeh i dont get how that works
[1/18/18, 2:20:45 PM] Donk: but thats a differnt type of tax
[1/18/18, 2:20:56 PM] Donk: the NYC Tax is a residency tax
[1/18/18, 2:21:23 PM] Donk: this would fall under state income taxes, which you pay where you work and where you live
[1/18/18, 2:21:44 PM] Miller: nj amazingly also has highest property taxes in the country
[1/18/18, 2:22:04 PM] Donk: not that surprising really
[1/18/18, 2:22:10 PM] Donk: it is the most densely populated state
[1/18/18, 2:22:18 PM] Miller: it is to me when 50% of jersey is a crime ridden wasteland
[1/18/18, 2:22:27 PM] Donk: lol
[1/18/18, 2:22:38 PM] Miller: and as far as i know it does not have exemplary schools
[1/18/18, 2:22:57 PM] Donk: there are good schools and bad schools, just like new york
[1/18/18, 2:23:07 PM] Donk: but any of the top schools are easily comparable to the top ny schools
[1/18/18, 2:23:29 PM] Miller: fair enough, i was basing this off heresay and nothingness
[1/18/18, 2:24:30 PM] Donk: property taxes are really not that much higher than the NY ones, i think westchester is probably worse than the most expensive NJ counties
[1/18/18, 2:24:31 PM] Miller: coworker looking in westchester, taxes there are absolutely insane
[1/18/18, 2:24:34 PM] Miller: makes LI look good
[1/18/18, 2:24:45 PM] Miller: i think it might be like the highest in the country
[1/18/18, 2:25:01 PM] Donk: yeah, luckily mine are not too terrible by comparison
[1/18/18, 2:25:47 PM] Miller: ~2.5% generally in nassau county by me
[1/18/18, 2:25:56 PM] Miller: with some random exceptions like great neck
[1/18/18, 2:25:59 PM] Donk: based on purchase price?
[1/18/18, 2:26:04 PM] Miller: yea
[1/18/18, 2:26:14 PM] Donk: mine are 2.5% actually then
[1/18/18, 2:26:36 PM] Miller: westhampton pleasantly surprised ~1%
[1/18/18, 2:26:42 PM] Donk: and i do get about 2k back on the star discount
[1/18/18, 2:26:48 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[1/18/18, 2:27:02 PM] Miller: when i thought about it makes more sense b/c nobody lives there full time so nobody uses the schools
[1/18/18, 2:27:16 PM] Miller: but initial reaction was b/c everything there so expensive would be bad
[1/18/18, 2:27:32 PM] Miller: also generally speaking pretty sure suffolk < nassau
[1/18/18, 2:28:19 PM] Miller: i cant remember if i get this STAR thing or not, i think i did at some point? maybe it expired? idk
[1/18/18, 2:28:33 PM] Miller: or i might still get it, idk my taxes all lumped into my mortgage monthly payments
[1/18/18, 2:28:47 PM] Donk: yeah, you probably get the discount on your taxes straight up
[1/18/18, 2:28:49 PM] Donk: they changed the law recently
[1/18/18, 2:28:54 PM] Donk: the first year i paid reduced taxes
[1/18/18, 2:28:59 PM] Justin: Baxter trying to just get it on buying some crypto
[1/18/18, 2:29:10 PM] Donk: but starting last year since i bought after a certain point they cahnged the program where i now pay the full amount and get a portion back
[1/18/18, 2:29:14 PM] Miller: im probably above-average in terms of how much attention i pay to my personal finances but even still theres so much shit i just cant deal w/or pay attention to
[1/18/18, 2:29:37 PM] Donk: so you probably bought ahead of that cut off line so you just get the discount as youpay instead
[1/18/18, 2:38:45 PM] Scott: really tho?
[1/18/18, 2:43:25 PM] Donk: yes, really though
[1/18/18, 2:44:52 PM] Donk: and really, why wouldnt they be?
[1/18/18, 2:45:20 PM] Donk: Northern Jersey its basically the same as westchester/long island in that they are generally liberal NYC suburbs
[1/18/18, 2:46:04 PM] Donk: just with online poker

[1/18/18, 8:41:45 PM] Justin: interesting
[1/18/18, 8:42:07 PM] Launchpad: also that wouldn't affect my canadian pot stocks
[1/18/18, 8:42:32 PM] Justin: would think it would boost bitcoin
[1/18/18, 8:42:46 PM] Justin: its the crypto worlsds dream
[1/18/18, 8:42:58 PM] Launchpad: its a non event
[1/18/18, 8:44:49 PM] Justin: fair enough
[1/18/18, 8:46:49 PM] Justin: thats very surprising
[1/18/18, 9:02:46 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/sports/mlbs-plan-can-make-baseball-games-least-10-minutes-shorter-224752035.html
[1/18/18, 9:02:48 PM] Justin: this is so fucken dumb
[1/18/18, 9:20:27 PM] Miller: It is indeed a non event
[1/18/18, 9:34:35 PM] Launchpad: a little too extreme. I don't like the clock for pitchers, but between batters could be a good idea
[1/18/18, 9:35:14 PM] Justin: yeh people gonna really start tuning in for a game that runs 2 hours 58 minutes as opposed to 3:08 minutes
[1/18/18, 9:37:08 PM] Miller: I don't like the pitch clock, I do like limiting the time between innings, the amount of mound visits, and the amount a batter or pitcher can step out
[1/18/18, 10:05:13 PM] Dan Watts: http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/22146958/nhl-aware-backlash-kid-rock-performing-all-star-game-standing-decision
[1/18/18, 10:05:52 PM] Dan Watts: I boycott hockey bc I think it sucks, but I want people to think it's bc I'm #woke
[1/18/18, 10:12:38 PM] Miller: Finally a boycott I can get behind
[1/18/18, 10:12:54 PM] Justin: boycott or not thats just sad for the nhl
[1/18/18, 10:13:00 PM] Brian Katz: Hockey‚Äôs a great sport
[1/18/18, 10:13:13 PM] Justin: like trump didnt even want that dude performing for him.....that says alot
[1/18/18, 10:14:13 PM] Brian Katz: I went to the New Years classic a few years ago and they had cee-Lo green perform. Needless to say he was booed out the building lol.
[1/18/18, 10:14:57 PM] Dan Watts: Fuck
[1/18/18, 10:15:04 PM] Justin: cee lo is a list comparably
[1/18/18, 10:15:14 PM] Dan Watts: I want to know if Steve is going to protest NHL
[1/18/18, 10:15:34 PM] Dan Watts: I'll text him directly to find out but it's more fun here
[1/18/18, 10:15:50 PM] Justin: the nhl didnt think twice
[1/18/18, 10:15:53 PM] Justin: thats my only advise
[1/18/18, 10:15:56 PM] Miller: He's been silently protesting after going from the world's biggest ranger fan to not caring when coincidentally he stopped working for them
[1/18/18, 10:16:06 PM] Launchpad: every time I think about Kid Rock Im reminded of the first scene in the first episode of Silicon Valley
[1/18/18, 10:16:26 PM] Kiyoon: https://youtu.be/qpAo_XvCQaQ
[1/18/18, 10:18:34 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs was the best
[1/18/18, 10:19:03 PM] Launchpad: this looks fucking hilarious
[1/19/18, 9:17:25 AM] Donk: this aziz thing is weird, its pitting various internet sjw i'm friends with against each other. they are fracturing
[1/19/18, 9:26:10 AM] Miller: post some screenshots
[1/19/18, 9:26:12 AM] Miller: let us enjoy
[1/19/18, 9:26:27 AM] Miller: my FB boring AF w/o making fun of herman
[1/19/18, 9:27:29 AM] Brian Katz: The Herman‚Äôs have always been a good source of entertainment.
[1/19/18, 9:29:05 AM] Donk: let me see what i can do, its not so much any particular comment, just overall threads which are like 100s of comments long
[1/19/18, 9:29:24 AM] Donk: the best though is the one girl who made the thread keeps yelling at people to stop commenting if they disagree with her in the slightest
[1/19/18, 9:29:27 AM] Donk: and then they never do
[1/19/18, 9:30:12 AM] Miller: i love when ppl post shit in public and are like i dont want anyone disagreeing with me though, stay off my page
[1/19/18, 9:31:07 AM] Miller: one girl i barely know constantly posts pseudo-political shit about middle east and whatnot but shes always saying she doesnt want people making it about politics/trump or w/e
[1/19/18, 9:31:13 AM] Miller: its like then stop posting that shit
[1/19/18, 9:33:09 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/18, 9:34:06 AM] Donk: yeah its ridiculous
[1/19/18, 9:34:56 AM] Donk: the funny part is that after yelling about at people to stop posting dissenting opinons yesterday, she posted something elose this morning and said something along the lines of "im posting this, dont comment, i will be deleting any comment" lol
[1/19/18, 9:38:26 AM] Miller: dont want comments? write that shit down in MS Word and save it
[1/19/18, 9:38:37 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[1/19/18, 9:40:08 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/18, 9:40:38 AM] Donk: man, hes looking rough

[1/19/18, 9:49:28 AM] Dan Watts: Bitcoin dropping to 7k today
[1/19/18, 9:50:03 AM] Donk: *Bitcoin correcting to 7k today --- fixed that for you
[1/19/18, 9:50:41 AM] Dan Watts: Lol thanks

This is a foul women. Club foul for sure
[1/19/18, 10:04:36 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/18, 10:28:05 AM] Launchpad: market must be asleep and didn't see the news
[1/19/18, 10:29:04 AM] Launchpad: btw just got my bonus from work direct deposit to my bank account -- Im not sure if theres a mistake or not, but after taxes I only took home 45%
[1/19/18, 10:29:15 AM] Launchpad: fucken outrageous
[1/19/18, 10:29:30 AM] Launchpad: and @16316620763 says I don't pay enough in taxes
[1/19/18, 10:29:44 AM] Kiyoon: I would think you would take home at least 55%
[1/19/18, 10:29:55 AM] Kiyoon: I think my bonus was taxed at 39%
[1/19/18, 10:30:00 AM] Donk: Each individual paycheck is taxed as if that is your yearly salary
[1/19/18, 10:31:11 AM] Launchpad: thats what I thought based on previous years
[1/19/18, 10:31:36 AM] Donk: It will all balance out om the end anyway
[1/19/18, 10:31:54 AM] Launchpad: all will be forgotten when btc at 100k
[1/19/18, 10:31:59 AM] Donk: But basically you gave the govt a interest free loan lol
[1/19/18, 10:32:17 AM] Launchpad: just doing my part
[1/19/18, 10:35:17 AM] Launchpad: anyways now I got this bonus, what do I spend it on?
[1/19/18, 10:35:25 AM] Launchpad: coins? stocks? hookers? blow?
[1/19/18, 10:36:57 AM] Brian Katz: Spend it on seasonal ale
[1/19/18, 10:37:13 AM] Launchpad: last summers @16102201963
[1/19/18, 10:57:22 AM] Miller: not necessarily true
[1/19/18, 10:57:31 AM] Miller: and could explain why LPs taxes were higher
[1/19/18, 10:57:52 AM] Miller: for us personally we can decide how much we want them to withhold from our bonus
[1/19/18, 10:57:56 AM] Donk: generally true
[1/19/18, 10:58:00 AM] Miller: for sure generally
[1/19/18, 10:58:03 AM] Donk: but yes, you can direct them to withhold at a differnt rate
[1/19/18, 10:58:14 AM] Miller: so its possible they err on the side of caution w/LP
[1/19/18, 10:58:21 AM] Donk: typically bonus are given the option of regular tax treatment or a flat 25%
[1/19/18, 10:58:21 AM] Miller: bc ppl like getting $ in april not paying $
[1/19/18, 10:58:29 AM] Donk: but in this case, soudns like they just withhled normally
[1/19/18, 10:58:30 AM] Miller: (even though it doesnt matter at the end of the day)
[1/19/18, 10:58:40 AM] Miller: 45% seems way too high
[1/19/18, 10:59:35 AM] Miller: 2yrs ago they fucked our shit up and taxed our bonuses at our normal income rates or w/e and everyone ended up owning a bunch of $ and was mad
[1/19/18, 10:59:44 AM] Miller: so they switched to taxing them at 50%
[1/19/18, 11:00:19 AM] Miller: sorry LP took home 45%
[1/19/18, 11:00:24 AM] Miller: 55% taxes is def not "real"
[1/19/18, 11:00:36 AM] Launchpad: in the past I've taken home 55%
[1/19/18, 11:00:43 AM] Launchpad: 45% sounds like Im getting low balled
[1/19/18, 11:00:51 AM] Donk: in the end it all balances out, everyone ends up paying the correct amount of taxes
[1/19/18, 11:01:01 AM] Miller: are you counting gross - taxes - withholdings or just gross - taxes
[1/19/18, 11:01:02 AM] Donk: the question is wehther or not you gave the govt a loan, or if they gave one to you
[1/19/18, 11:01:26 AM] Miller: it amuses me to no end that 99% of the country still doesnt understand this concept
[1/19/18, 11:01:50 AM] Donk: just like marginal tax rates
[1/19/18, 11:02:01 AM] Miller: or the estate  tax
[1/19/18, 11:02:11 AM] Donk: anything having to do wwith taxes really
[1/19/18, 11:02:15 AM] Launchpad: Im pretty sure Im going to owe them money this year so I would like to avoid paying as much as I can
[1/19/18, 11:02:21 AM] Miller: totally understand the mental aspect of wanting to have a refund vs wanting to owe in terms of planning finances etc... but people literally dont understand the net result does not matter
[1/19/18, 11:02:36 AM] Launchpad: how does it
[1/19/18, 11:02:41 AM] Launchpad: 'not matter'
[1/19/18, 11:02:42 AM] Donk: it also explains why there are so many tax refund/filing places, because most people dont realize that with one w-2, than can do it for free with turbo taxes
[1/19/18, 11:02:51 AM] Donk: or similar program
[1/19/18, 11:02:55 AM] Donk: and would take like 25minutes
[1/19/18, 11:03:02 AM] Launchpad: unless you have investments
[1/19/18, 11:03:02 AM] Miller: it doesnt matter b/c you pay the same regardless at the end of the day
[1/19/18, 11:03:19 AM] Donk: true, though most people do not
[1/19/18, 11:03:23 AM] Miller: if you want to argue it matters b/c you have some unreasonable estimate of your opportunity cost on your cash, thats a personal issue
[1/19/18, 11:03:29 AM] Launchpad: yeah but theres a difference between paying today and paying 6 months from now
[1/19/18, 11:04:07 AM] Launchpad: I am almost certain I will need to sell something in order to pay my tax bill in April
[1/19/18, 11:04:14 AM] Miller: kidney?
[1/19/18, 11:04:15 AM] Launchpad: so yes, that is opportunity cost
[1/19/18, 11:04:34 AM] Launchpad: especially when cryptos are going up 100% a week
[1/19/18, 11:04:38 AM] Miller: like financially speaking should i have taken a 1.5% loan on my car or nicoles car? sure probably
[1/19/18, 11:04:56 AM] Miller: but mentally speaking i dont like having debt
[1/19/18, 11:05:28 AM] Miller: same idea w/govt, i would prefer to get money back then be surprised w/owing money
[1/19/18, 11:05:48 AM] Donk: i was talking to someone the other day about this, and this person hated owing anyone money so much that they literally paid their cc bill every single day (or when they made a purchase anyway)
[1/19/18, 11:05:57 AM] Miller: sure id like to get it to close to 0 as possible but i would err on the side caution
[1/19/18, 11:06:01 AM] Miller: my coworker does this
[1/19/18, 11:06:25 AM] Miller: i sympathize generally speaking but i have never gone to that extreme
[1/19/18, 11:06:26 AM] Kiyoon: me, total opposite
[1/19/18, 11:06:43 AM] Miller: you love owing people money?
[1/19/18, 11:06:46 AM] Donk: you only pay when it gets to the collection agency?
[1/19/18, 11:06:55 AM] Kiyoon: exactly Donk
[1/19/18, 11:07:23 AM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/18, 11:07:32 AM] Miller: i assume launchpad is constantly opening up new cards to get the 12-18month 0% APR benefit
[1/19/18, 11:08:03 AM] Miller: cant be paying for things now that you could pay for later
[1/19/18, 11:08:18 AM] Kiyoon: do any of you have a CC that has less than 10% APR
[1/19/18, 11:08:48 AM] Miller: i honestly have no idea, ive never had a balance and have this weird thing about only buying things i can afford to pay for at the time
[1/19/18, 11:09:16 AM] Kiyoon: some of us dont make a milly Miller
[1/19/18, 11:09:40 AM] Miller: spending less than you make is applicable to almost any income level
[1/19/18, 11:09:45 AM] Miller: ill acknowlede it gets extremely difficult down at 15-20k/yr
[1/19/18, 11:10:13 AM] Launchpad: been ranting about this for years
[1/19/18, 11:10:32 AM] Miller: maybe stop eating so much avocado toast? ever consider that?
[1/19/18, 11:10:55 AM] Kiyoon: harsh reality, just budgeted out saving for a wedding
[1/19/18, 11:11:00 AM] Kiyoon: ramen noodles all day
[1/19/18, 11:11:14 AM] Launchpad: Fact: Most people say they would save more if they made more
Fact: Most people inflate their lifestyles as soon as they get a raise
[1/19/18, 11:12:07 AM] Miller: yea weddings suck
[1/19/18, 11:12:24 AM] Miller: although i got more $ than expected from guests generally speaking
[1/19/18, 11:12:32 AM] Miller: and father in law insisted i take 10k from him
[1/19/18, 11:12:39 AM] Miller: so net/net was only out of pocket like 10k
[1/19/18, 11:12:58 AM] Kiyoon: yeah I'm praying our parents help us out
[1/19/18, 11:13:14 AM] Miller: but i also did everything about as cheaply as possible w/in reason, my flowers were from price chopper, was in upstate NY, my videographer was like 1k, i had a DJ etc...
[1/19/18, 11:13:18 AM] Miller: still 40-50k or something
[1/19/18, 11:13:46 AM] Miller: i figured out its basically impossible to have a cheap wedding, either you get married at city hall or in your backyard or something for like $1k or the next cheapest is $40k for a "real" wedding
[1/19/18, 11:13:56 AM] Miller: and in nyc can easily get into 6 figures
[1/19/18, 11:14:07 AM] Kiyoon: just ask Cheese!
[1/19/18, 11:14:23 AM] Miller: not sure he got his moneys worth
[1/19/18, 11:15:05 AM] Launchpad: gtfo....Cheese spend 6 figures on his wedding?
[1/19/18, 11:15:19 AM] Launchpad: no wonder hes still holding those Sam seasonals....poor guy
[1/19/18, 11:15:23 AM] Kiyoon: I mean I assume
[1/19/18, 11:15:27 AM] Kiyoon: that was a baller wedding
[1/19/18, 11:15:58 AM] Launchpad: oh really? I wouldn't know I didn't get the invite
[1/19/18, 11:16:14 AM] Launchpad: üò≠
[1/19/18, 11:16:42 AM] Miller: damn there was like 400 ppl there too
[1/19/18, 11:16:46 AM] Miller: even rich jonesn got invited
[1/19/18, 11:17:27 AM] Launchpad: lower than rich jones on the societal totem pole thats pretty terrible
[1/19/18, 11:18:02 AM] Brian Katz: I barely knew cheese at the time and I got invited.
[1/19/18, 11:18:22 AM] Miller: i remember katz opening the invitation "who is scott richardson?"
[1/19/18, 11:18:33 AM] Brian Katz: Lol yup
[1/19/18, 11:18:36 AM] Kiyoon: wait you werent there Scott?
[1/19/18, 11:18:42 AM] Kiyoon: I 100% thought you were there
[1/19/18, 11:18:46 AM] Kiyoon: maybe that was Donks wedding
[1/19/18, 11:18:52 AM] Kiyoon: dude even Goodman got an invite
[1/19/18, 11:19:23 AM] Miller: lol keep it going
[1/19/18, 11:19:33 AM] Scott: We didn't talk at all before that
[1/19/18, 11:19:34 AM] Miller: i think that old jewish landlord from 127 was there also
[1/19/18, 11:19:38 AM] Scott: And Kara invited Goodman
[1/19/18, 11:19:48 AM] Kiyoon: Abe!!
[1/19/18, 11:19:54 AM] Miller: yes abe
[1/19/18, 11:19:56 AM] Scott: Don't worry ull get an invite to the inevitable second one
[1/19/18, 11:19:59 AM] Scott: I also invited izzy
[1/19/18, 11:19:59 AM] Miller: izzy also
[1/19/18, 11:20:07 AM] Kiyoon: bahahah
[1/19/18, 11:20:14 AM] Launchpad: lolol
[1/19/18, 11:20:20 AM] Kiyoon: dude used to come banging on the door
[1/19/18, 11:20:22 AM] Miller: dont worry though LP you were like right there below those guys
[1/19/18, 11:20:24 AM] Miller: if one of them had dropped
[1/19/18, 11:20:25 AM] Kiyoon: hey potsmokers!! Need the rent check!!
[1/19/18, 11:20:28 AM] Brian Katz: I remember Rich jones rsvping and no showing
[1/19/18, 11:20:43 AM] Miller: that wasnt even the best rich jones moment of that wedding
[1/19/18, 11:20:50 AM] Launchpad: Its a numbers game I know
[1/19/18, 11:20:52 AM] Brian Katz: What was?
[1/19/18, 11:20:55 AM] Kiyoon: Now that I know about planning for a wedding (a little bit) I would be pissed if someone RSVPed and didnt show
[1/19/18, 11:20:57 AM] Miller: cheese had like a pre-wedding brunch
[1/19/18, 11:21:06 AM] Miller: like 10am sunday morning
[1/19/18, 11:21:15 AM] Miller: me/steve/watts went to kanye the night before
[1/19/18, 11:21:29 AM] Miller: so were there hungover eating bagels drinking mimosas (until the 1 bottle of champagne ran out)
[1/19/18, 11:21:37 AM] Miller: and its like somewhat dressy
[1/19/18, 11:21:37 AM] Brian Katz: I thought it was jayz?
[1/19/18, 11:21:43 AM] Miller: like khakis and button downs
[1/19/18, 11:21:49 AM] Brian Katz: And it was you Fienberg his brother
[1/19/18, 11:22:11 AM] Miller: and in walks rich jones in totally casual clothes
[1/19/18, 11:22:15 AM] Miller: with headphones on
[1/19/18, 11:22:16 AM] Miller: and a book bag
[1/19/18, 11:22:17 AM] Donk: late
[1/19/18, 11:22:22 AM] Donk: very late
[1/19/18, 11:22:23 AM] Miller: walked in took like 15 bagels
[1/19/18, 11:22:25 AM] Miller: stuffed them in his backpack
[1/19/18, 11:22:27 AM] Miller: and bounced
[1/19/18, 11:22:31 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[1/19/18, 11:22:58 AM] Kiyoon: and now he is a lawyer
[1/19/18, 11:23:01 AM] Kiyoon: next to Watts
[1/19/18, 11:23:10 AM] Miller: and then followed it up w/RSVPing to the wedding and not coming
[1/19/18, 11:23:10 AM] Miller: so good
[1/19/18, 11:23:40 AM] Launchpad: such a scumbag
[1/19/18, 11:23:46 AM] Brian Katz: Why was that guy so grimy?
[1/19/18, 11:23:54 AM] Brian Katz: Was he always like that?
[1/19/18, 11:23:56 AM] Miller: just the way he is
[1/19/18, 11:23:58 AM] Miller: yes
[1/19/18, 11:24:02 AM] Miller: maybe worse?
[1/19/18, 11:24:13 AM] Brian Katz: Why‚Äôd you let him in your frat?
[1/19/18, 11:24:32 AM] Miller: i had already gotten shit for negging too many people
[1/19/18, 11:24:39 AM] Launchpad: i mean sure, like if you had a bookbag and saw a table full of bagels you'd stuff 15 in your bag too -- but hes beyond that level of grime
[1/19/18, 11:24:39 AM] Kiyoon: Dude would come hang out, and I would be missing liek 3 cans of soup
[1/19/18, 11:24:55 AM] Miller: so then i stopped fighting and we let in the rich jones and groupers and doogies of the world
[1/19/18, 11:25:04 AM] Miller: so dumb "if we dont have people its gonna end"
[1/19/18, 11:25:05 AM] Miller: well it ended anyway
[1/19/18, 11:25:09 AM] Launchpad: he would run out of money on his meal card and eat ketchup bottles in the dining hall
[1/19/18, 11:25:12 AM] Miller: would have rather gone out w/only ppl i liked
[1/19/18, 11:25:28 AM] Brian Katz: You should‚Äôve kept your standards up Miller
[1/19/18, 11:25:50 AM] Miller: the hebrew hammer fight took a lot out of me
[1/19/18, 11:26:20 AM] Miller: i think herman liked rich jones b/c he played videogames or something
[1/19/18, 11:26:25 AM] Donk: him showing up for new years party and walking in to your house smoking a stoge was pretty hilarious
[1/19/18, 11:26:37 AM] Donk: also, the hebrew hammer was a good kid, we should have let that kid in
[1/19/18, 11:26:38 AM] Miller: idk i forget how that kid ended up being brought around initially
[1/19/18, 11:26:43 AM] Miller: no fuck that kid
[1/19/18, 11:26:55 AM] Donk: much better than grouper or doogie
[1/19/18, 11:26:56 AM] Miller: oh wait nevermind
[1/19/18, 11:27:00 AM] Miller: im thinking of someone else i think
[1/19/18, 11:27:04 AM] Miller: im thinking of this kid pete
[1/19/18, 11:27:11 AM] Launchpad: our problem is we let chief in and made randy pledge with him
[1/19/18, 11:27:12 AM] Miller: who got SUPER fat btw
[1/19/18, 11:27:27 AM] Launchpad: fat pete?
[1/19/18, 11:27:34 AM] Miller: he wasnt fat
[1/19/18, 11:27:36 AM] Miller: hes now huge
[1/19/18, 11:27:41 AM] Kiyoon: who was the hebrew hammer
[1/19/18, 11:27:43 AM] Miller: he was chiefs friend
[1/19/18, 11:27:53 AM] Miller: but i didnt like him
[1/19/18, 11:27:54 AM] Miller: and i negged him
[1/19/18, 11:27:57 AM] Donk: i think his name is david burghauser or something cloes to that
[1/19/18, 11:28:00 AM] Miller: and then chief told him i negged him
[1/19/18, 11:28:00 AM] Donk: (the hebrew hammer that is)
[1/19/18, 11:28:09 AM] Miller: and so then i was like well now definitely fuck that kid
[1/19/18, 11:28:34 AM] Miller: not coincidentally the last time he was at my house
[1/19/18, 11:28:58 AM] Miller: the worst was when he called herman and herman told him he was going to my house for new yrs and then he called me and asked me if he could come and i was like yea, no
[1/19/18, 11:29:11 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[1/19/18, 11:29:37 AM] Miller: i had not spoken to him or seen him since 12mo ago the previous year new yrs
[1/19/18, 11:30:18 AM] Brian Katz: He called me that night to pick him up from the train station. I was like one who is this? Two how‚Äôd you get my number?
[1/19/18, 11:30:40 AM] Miller: hes a good lesson in the dont answer #s you dont recognize on your phone
[1/19/18, 11:30:40 AM] Launchpad: He punched me in the face when I was sleeping then ran away like a little bitch
[1/19/18, 11:30:50 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[1/19/18, 11:30:56 AM] Miller: you probably deserved it
[1/19/18, 11:31:00 AM] Miller: rambling on about bitcoin
[1/19/18, 11:31:12 AM] Kiyoon: Wait how long had you known him or hung out with him
[1/19/18, 11:31:18 AM] Donk: likely this was during the silver ranting days
[1/19/18, 11:31:43 AM] Brian Katz: That should our thing with Scotty going forward. Punching him in the face while he‚Äôs sleeping, running. Lol
[1/19/18, 11:32:24 AM] Miller: katz had like 2 glorious encounters w/him
[1/19/18, 11:32:29 AM] Miller: but he was living w/herman at the time
[1/19/18, 11:32:33 AM] Miller: and herman wasnt answering his phone
[1/19/18, 11:32:55 AM] Brian Katz: I don‚Äôt really remember, but I never hung out with him besides millers or Steve‚Äôs parties.
[1/19/18, 11:33:29 AM] Brian Katz: You know what, I think Herman gave him my number.
[1/19/18, 11:33:40 AM] Miller: herman def gave him my #
[1/19/18, 11:33:42 AM] Miller: sounds like a pattern
[1/19/18, 11:34:05 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs punch in the face while asleep worthy right there Herman.
[1/19/18, 11:34:57 AM] Launchpad: You know he's still sleeping... can someone go over to NJ to punch him in the face?
[1/19/18, 11:35:30 AM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôd have to fight my way to his apartment the raid style to do so.
[1/19/18, 11:36:09 AM] Miller: hes actually awake
[1/19/18, 12:18:23 PM] Donk: the eagles need to lose on sunday. i cant take two weeks of non-stop eagles stories

[1/19/18, 12:44:27 PM] Launchpad: If you‚Äôre on-board for Amazon‚Äôs monthly Prime membership, I‚Äôve got a bit of bad news for you on this cold January morning. The company‚Äôs bumping up pricing from $10.99 to $12.99. Not the end of the world, of course, but that comes out to about $156 a year ‚Äî a $24 increase over the old price.

Amazon has confirmed the price increase with TechCrunch and laid all of this out on its Prime page. It also handily points out if you bite the bullet and pay the $99 yearly fee all up front, pricing will stay the same. In other words, the company would really like to just lock you into that lump sum. The company settled on the yearly pricing back in 2014, when things went up by $20.
[1/19/18, 12:44:42 PM] Launchpad: Of course if you are on Prime month to month I question your sanity
[1/19/18, 12:45:08 PM] Miller: my guess is  there is a decent amount of ppl who sign up for monthly like just for xmas or w/e
[1/19/18, 12:45:17 PM] Miller: and so amazon wants to make it a little more painful for them
[1/19/18, 12:45:27 PM] Launchpad: yeah that makes sense

[1/19/18, 1:13:19 PM] Justin: The company is betting that its impact on movie performance will convince companies to hop aboard. MoviePass normally accounts for roughly 3 percent of US box office sales, but that figure has jumped to 10 percent or more when it uses its app and overall platform to influence viewing, such as The Post and The Shape of Water. In short: if MoviePass takes a share, it could do more to promote a movie and help its success.

[1/19/18, 2:15:35 PM] Donk: he might be on to something here with the little pizzas on top of pizzas

[1/19/18, 6:51:53 PM] Justin: I mean I made up the whole Clinton foundation part. But I'm sure it will be a valid talking point across internet soon enough.
[1/19/18, 6:52:13 PM] Brian Katz: Why would you do that?
[1/19/18, 6:53:02 PM] Justin: Because the clintons are evil and run sex trafficking operations out of multiple locations, everyone knows this as fact. And why would this guy do what he did and kill himself?  Now it all makes sense
[1/19/18, 6:53:19 PM] Justin: It's a cover up. They won't release the tapes.

[1/19/18, 10:00:55 PM] Scott: They did?
[1/19/18, 10:06:58 PM] Tk: Yup. They want to dump his contract. 90% of  the NBA is overpaid.
[1/19/18, 10:10:48 PM] Tk: My mistake, Horner's put up Kemba walker

[1/20/18, 1:38:08 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/20/18, 2:51:17 PM] Miller: Is this mom right to charge her 5-year-old daughter rent?
[1/20/18, 2:52:00 PM] Miller: So her mom gives her 7 dollars and then takes 5 back and someone is actually asking if she is right to do that?
[1/20/18, 2:52:19 PM] Miller: Or she could give her 0 dollars and take 0 dollars for rent
[1/20/18, 2:52:27 PM] Miller: People are so dumb
[1/20/18, 2:56:57 PM] Justin: Yeh I could care less, probably smart but maybe should give her 12$ and take 7.
[1/20/18, 2:57:26 PM] Justin: And earth around sun thing is pretty great

[1/22/18, 8:45:09 PM] Miller: Lil Pump >>>
[1/22/18, 8:46:08 PM] Scott: Chris webby

[1/23/18, 11:29:26 AM] Donk: im beginning to think that you need to add a #MAGA to your instagram profile launchpad
[1/23/18, 11:29:37 AM] Donk: or maybe a #TRUMPTRAIN instead
[1/23/18, 11:32:58 AM] Launchpad: I don't like Trump, but would you rather watch the world burn so you can say I told you so?
[1/23/18, 11:33:18 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/23/18, 11:34:41 AM] Miller: literally everything in this country is basically designed to keep poor people poor
[1/23/18, 11:35:22 AM] Donk: but walmart gave out a couple of bonuses, they should be good now
[1/23/18, 11:36:00 AM] Miller: true if people invested that entire bonus into bitcoin at 9k and then sold it at 12k they would maybe have enough $ in their checking accounts to avoid paying a monthly fee
[1/23/18, 11:43:40 AM] Launchpad: Gee I wish there was a blossoming industry that offered an alternative to banking. But since its not perfect now, we'll just stop building it and let the BofA's and JPM's treat us however they'd like
[1/23/18, 11:48:17 AM] Donk: werent you just basically promoting JPM two seconds ago?
[1/23/18, 11:48:37 AM] Launchpad: I posted an article without comment
[1/23/18, 11:48:52 AM] Donk: when you tagged herman, we all knew what the comment was lol
[1/23/18, 11:48:55 AM] Launchpad: have you ever seen me promote JPM?
[1/23/18, 11:49:27 AM] Launchpad: cause he hates them more than I do
[1/23/18, 11:50:57 AM] Miller: im not totally sure if you are referring to credit unions or blockchain here
[1/23/18, 11:51:02 AM] Miller: but if its the latter, wow
[1/23/18, 11:51:30 AM] Brian Katz: Are you guys still talking about crypto currency?
[1/23/18, 11:51:42 AM] Miller: i was talking about banc of america
[1/23/18, 11:53:39 AM] Launchpad: The blockchain is providing jobs.  Not just companies needing developers for creating new blockchain products. I mean individuals are getting paid directly from the blockchain itself for freelance work
[1/23/18, 11:54:40 AM] Miller: lol sure, the idea that the blockchain in its current form is even remotely capable as a banking substitute is probably the most insane thing you have ever said
[1/23/18, 11:54:48 AM] Miller: prove me wrong, get rid of your bank account
[1/23/18, 11:55:54 AM] Miller: i am fine w/banks not providing free checking, clearly it costs them money to offer it so charging for it in some way is fine, charging $12 for customers who are clearly not using any services is beyond obnoxious
[1/23/18, 11:56:48 AM] Launchpad: I didn't say its exactly as capable for everyone today (some people yes). My point is you like to bash the technology. Its like bashing disk drives and saying PCs are too slow they'll never amount to anything its all a  bubble
[1/23/18, 11:57:11 AM] Launchpad: Solutions are on the way
[1/23/18, 11:57:27 AM] Launchpad: and yes it is obnoxious to charge $12 a month for checking
[1/23/18, 11:57:36 AM] Miller: i never bashed the technology
[1/23/18, 12:08:31 PM] Justin: I'll bash it. It's not the future
[1/23/18, 12:08:37 PM] Justin: Btw
[1/23/18, 12:08:54 PM] Justin: https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/mbpp4p/canadas-weed-stocks-are-out-of-control?utm_source=vicenewsfb
[1/23/18, 12:12:28 PM] Justin: But isn't the point of checking accounts that it enables banks to lend?
[1/23/18, 12:13:44 PM] Miller: yes but someone w/$120 in their checking account for example, $120 in deposits for bank of america or some other large bank doesnt fucking do anything
[1/23/18, 12:14:02 PM] Miller: so to the extent they are supporting this customer w/branches, ATMs, mobile apps, bill pay, debit cards etc...
[1/23/18, 12:14:05 PM] Miller: they are losing $
[1/23/18, 12:14:18 PM] Miller: but if you run the math, if they are in theory breaking even at $1500 of balances
[1/23/18, 12:14:20 PM] Miller: that is not close to $12/mo
[1/23/18, 12:15:05 PM] Justin: What's the math say
[1/23/18, 12:15:05 PM] Miller: at 3% spread $1500 would be bringing in $4/month in net interest income
[1/23/18, 12:15:12 PM] Launchpad: You can leverage that out though.  How much is interest on a 15,000 loan?
[1/23/18, 12:15:12 PM] Justin: Got ya
[1/23/18, 12:15:35 PM] Justin: I figured he included that
[1/23/18, 12:15:42 PM] Miller: almost no bank is running > 100% loan/deposit
[1/23/18, 12:15:56 PM] Justin: Really?
[1/23/18, 12:16:03 PM] Miller: and certainly not any of the large banks
[1/23/18, 12:16:29 PM] Justin: Is that a new phenomenon?
[1/23/18, 12:16:41 PM] Justin: Like what was it in past couple decades
[1/23/18, 12:16:55 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/23/18, 12:16:56 PM] Launchpad: then what is fractional reserve banking?
[1/23/18, 12:16:59 PM] Justin: Are you saying they put their leverage elsewhere?
[1/23/18, 12:17:00 PM] Miller: need to click on picture
[1/23/18, 12:17:21 PM] Justin: As in the commercial banking side?
[1/23/18, 12:17:53 PM] Miller: the idea of "leverage" in the banking system is more about assets vs equity, not assets vs liabilities (deposits)
[1/23/18, 12:18:19 PM] Justin: What makes up equity?
[1/23/18, 12:18:53 PM] Miller: common stock, retained earnings, (pfd stock if you count total equity)
[1/23/18, 12:19:09 PM] Miller: dont mean to be a dick but this is easier for both of us if you google it
[1/23/18, 12:19:38 PM] Justin: Fair enough. I'm on lp side for a change. Would ha e asked same question

[1/23/18, 2:17:25 PM] Miller: 2/1 earnings call
[1/23/18, 2:24:52 PM] Launchpad: more likely to accept litecoin than bitcoin
[1/23/18, 2:51:42 PM] Launchpad: bubbles blowing up everywhere
[1/23/18, 2:52:25 PM] Launchpad: not sure if you're warning me or congratulating me üòÇ
[1/23/18, 3:02:23 PM] Justin: Meant more as a warning for anyone who read this
[1/23/18, 3:34:43 PM] Dan Watts: Anyone know boxer Pauly Maglnaggi? On train with him right now

[1/23/18, 4:54:47 PM] Donk: thats the worst
[1/23/18, 4:55:06 PM] Donk: fwiw, i had a situation a few years back where my isnurance company wasnt going to cover something
[1/23/18, 4:55:15 PM] Donk: so i just kept resubmitting it over and over again
[1/23/18, 4:55:24 PM] Donk: and eventually, they did cover it
[1/23/18, 4:56:04 PM] Launchpad: lol nice
[1/23/18, 4:57:06 PM] Launchpad: Cost me an extra $385. If it didn't come out of my HSA which is basically a black hole I paid into 2 years ago, Id be a lot more pissed and probably want to dispute
[1/23/18, 4:57:12 PM] Launchpad: maybe I still will
[1/23/18, 4:57:34 PM] Launchpad: but I did just pay back the dentist, they were calling me for days
[1/23/18, 4:58:10 PM] Donk: yeah, my bill was considerably more than that which is why i was so persistent in not paying it lol
[1/23/18, 6:08:38 PM] Justin: dentist wouldn't take lite coin?
[1/23/18, 6:10:21 PM] Launchpad: that part of the equation is irrelevant
[1/23/18, 6:12:04 PM] Justin: Yeh insurance companies are fucken scams
[1/23/18, 6:12:11 PM] Justin: Entire industry is a scam
[1/23/18, 6:12:34 PM] Launchpad: pretty much
[1/23/18, 6:12:59 PM] Justin: Built on denying claims and creating irresponsible cost claims for the uninsured.
[1/23/18, 6:13:33 PM] Justin: Pretty much government couldn't possibly fuck up as bad as private industry has with medical insurance.
[1/23/18, 6:14:54 PM] Launchpad: Im sure they could fuck it up just as badly
[1/23/18, 6:15:05 PM] Launchpad: but competition is healthy
[1/23/18, 6:15:08 PM] Justin: Not possible
[1/23/18, 6:16:44 PM] Justin: Competition is a Cool phrase in an economy that has pretty much 3 big players that control a large majority of market shares in almost every  single industry across board
[1/23/18, 6:24:42 PM] Launchpad: Govt is real efficient. The public just loves going to the dmv
[1/23/18, 6:25:30 PM] Launchpad: and how much does the govt control in that economy?
[1/23/18, 6:25:43 PM] Justin: very little?
[1/23/18, 6:25:50 PM] Launchpad: Are you a communist or socialist? Or just far left
[1/23/18, 6:25:51 PM] Justin: the government does create that financial control
[1/23/18, 6:25:55 PM] Justin: but thats a whole other story
[1/23/18, 6:26:06 PM] Launchpad: defense spending, VA, HHS
[1/23/18, 6:26:29 PM] Justin: how is spending control?
[1/23/18, 6:26:47 PM] Launchpad: how about this
[1/23/18, 6:26:52 PM] Launchpad: what does the govt do so well?
[1/23/18, 6:26:52 PM] Justin: thats like i saying i control coke becuase i purchase coke zero all day
[1/23/18, 6:27:28 PM] Justin: does government enable the plutocracy, absolutely
[1/23/18, 6:27:42 PM] Launchpad: free markets buddy
[1/23/18, 6:27:46 PM] Justin: but the dmv is no worse than an insurance company that denies emdical claim after medical claim
[1/23/18, 6:27:58 PM] Launchpad: its like you are telling me that you hate winning
[1/23/18, 6:28:03 PM] Justin: what free market?
[1/23/18, 6:28:17 PM] Launchpad: whats not free?
[1/23/18, 6:28:19 PM] Justin: where is this "free market"?
[1/23/18, 6:28:27 PM] Justin: idk the roads you drive on
[1/23/18, 6:28:31 PM] Justin: the high school you went to
[1/23/18, 6:28:33 PM] Justin: the college you went to
[1/23/18, 6:28:41 PM] Justin: the contract you employer has with the government
[1/23/18, 6:28:53 PM] Justin: so pretty much almost your entire life is based on the "dmv" model
[1/23/18, 6:29:01 PM] Justin: yeh its terrible
[1/23/18, 6:29:19 PM] Justin: now i ask again, show me the free amrket part
[1/23/18, 6:29:51 PM] Launchpad: public high school vs private high school
[1/23/18, 6:30:11 PM] Justin: private high school is free amrket?
[1/23/18, 6:30:17 PM] Launchpad: yeah
[1/23/18, 6:30:20 PM] Launchpad: how is it not
[1/23/18, 6:31:07 PM] Launchpad: cause its too expensive for most people?
[1/23/18, 6:32:09 PM] Justin: Fourteen states and the District of Columbia provide state-funded school vouchers to qualifying students. While each state approaches school vouchers differently, there are common questions states must address when developing their voucher programs. These include:
[1/23/18, 6:32:40 PM] Justin: not to mention the entire charter sytem which is funded by public funds
[1/23/18, 6:32:59 PM] Justin: but i cna get if you dont consider private charter schools "traditional" private schools
[1/23/18, 6:33:14 PM] Launchpad: whats your point?
[1/23/18, 6:33:26 PM] Launchpad: are you advocating for complete anarchy?
[1/23/18, 6:33:27 PM] Justin: its msotly still not free
[1/23/18, 6:35:25 PM] Justin: no im just saying language like " free market" and "competition" being associated as real outcomes of private companies, and the dmv representing the government, isn't only over simplistic but is factually incorrect
[1/23/18, 6:35:51 PM] Justin: most private companies don't benefit form competiion, they benefit from regulation
[1/23/18, 6:36:41 PM] Launchpad: obviously
[1/23/18, 6:36:59 PM] Justin: which brings us back to what would be a solid argument on your side, the economy is a sham created by socialism.  But noone actually wnats that
[1/23/18, 6:36:56 PM] Launchpad: do private companies lobby for the laws? yeah
[1/23/18, 6:37:17 PM] Justin: and you brag about the economy all day, so you dont want that either
[1/23/18, 6:37:57 PM] Justin: you prety much summon words like free market as the driving force in our eocnomy when the relaity is the drinving force is socialism itself, albeit corporate socilaism
[1/23/18, 6:38:17 PM] Launchpad: are there cheaters in this world? yes
[1/23/18, 6:38:24 PM] Launchpad: people who don't play fair?
[1/23/18, 6:38:26 PM] Launchpad: yes
[1/23/18, 6:38:29 PM] Launchpad: so fucken what
[1/23/18, 6:38:40 PM] Launchpad: Het off your ass and do something. Beat them at their own game
[1/23/18, 6:38:44 PM] Launchpad: **Get
[1/23/18, 6:38:52 PM] Justin: what does that mean..im not concerned with cheaters.  I just wnat you to admit the fre emarket doenst exist, what exists is socialistm
[1/23/18, 6:38:58 PM] Justin: so at least clal a spade a spade
[1/23/18, 6:39:03 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/23/18, 6:39:10 PM] Launchpad: call it whatever you want
[1/23/18, 6:39:19 PM] Launchpad: fine we're a socialist country
[1/23/18, 6:39:23 PM] Justin: ok were good now lol
[1/23/18, 6:39:24 PM] Launchpad: can we get back to work now?
[1/23/18, 6:39:32 PM] Justin: yeh thats all i wanted

[1/24/18, 9:09:02 AM] Donk: how many copies of could that album have sold in the first place?
[1/24/18, 9:09:21 AM] Donk: how many copies of that album could have been sold in the first place?
[1/24/18, 9:09:22 AM] Miller: wikipedia said ~150k
[1/24/18, 9:09:29 AM] Miller: now the next question
[1/24/18, 9:09:49 AM] Donk: what could 50 himself have actually made off of those sales?
[1/24/18, 9:10:04 AM] Miller: well i think he probably made almost all of it
[1/24/18, 9:10:11 AM] Miller: but the next question is how many of those 150k were purchased in bitcoin
[1/24/18, 9:10:18 AM] Miller: 1%? 5%? 10%?
[1/24/18, 9:10:42 AM] Miller: 10% seems insanely high, 1-5% seems reasonable probably borderline generous
[1/24/18, 9:11:40 AM] Donk: yeah, 1% seems reasonable
[1/24/18, 9:11:55 AM] Scott: Assuming the article is even minimally truthful...
[1/24/18, 9:12:03 AM] Miller: but even take 10% so 15k copies, at $15/pop with BTC @ $660/coin that is .02BC per album, so 15,000*.02 = 340 BTC which at 10k would be 3.4m
[1/24/18, 9:12:17 AM] Miller: which is about 1/2 what the article claims
[1/24/18, 9:12:33 AM] Scott: Falsus in uno falsus in omnibus
[1/24/18, 9:12:37 AM] Miller: more likely its < 500k
[1/24/18, 9:12:57 AM] Miller: as i would be shocked if he actually sold 15k copies that people bought using BTC
[1/24/18, 9:13:16 AM] Donk: im pretty shocked that he sold 150k albums in the first place
[1/24/18, 9:13:42 AM] Miller: it was one thing for people to use it to buy drugs online b/c it was the only option, i cannot imagine anyone realistically using it when cash is an option and buying something totally normal/legal
[1/24/18, 9:14:00 AM] Donk: esp given how difficult it was to buy the coins in the first place back then
[1/24/18, 9:14:03 AM] Miller: 124k, i was off slightly
[1/24/18, 9:14:30 AM] Miller: but i agree anything > 100k is a surprise tom e
[1/24/18, 9:15:04 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/24/18, 9:21:24 AM] Donk: yeah, at this point he should stick to acting
[1/24/18, 9:22:33 AM] Miller: reminds me more of like ricky henderson playing independent ball at 50, i dont think hes doing it for the $ i think he just cant let go
[1/24/18, 9:22:55 AM] Miller: to be fair after going about 8 years w/o a hit he finally got one last yr
[1/24/18, 9:23:03 AM] Miller: im the man single went platinum

[1/24/18, 10:55:07 AM] Launchpad: 1) 2) 5) 6) 7)
[1/24/18, 10:55:15 AM] Miller: and then answer me why anyone with a credit or debit card would willingly pay with BTC instead with no discount or incentive
[1/24/18, 10:56:46 AM] Miller: youre right, totally likely 25% of his album sales came in the form of bitcoin üòÇ
[1/24/18, 10:58:24 AM] Launchpad: Its possible that him accepting BTC 'went viral' with coinholders looking to spend their BTC
[1/24/18, 10:59:30 AM] Launchpad: i don't know i dgaf about 50

[1/24/18, 8:31:37 PM] Miller: That argument is stupid, if I win the mega millions and then go broke not gonna be like lol oh well my cost basis was only $1
[1/24/18, 8:32:38 PM] Launchpad: Its literally impossible for me to 'go broke' or 'lose money' in crypto unless I take money out of my bank account and put it in the market
[1/24/18, 8:33:08 PM] Miller: Losing unrealized gains is still losing money
[1/24/18, 8:33:08 PM] Launchpad: and its not a stupid argument because litecoin is not going anywhere
[1/24/18, 8:33:44 PM] Launchpad: am I supposed to day trade every moment?
[1/24/18, 8:33:53 PM] Miller: Did I say that?
[1/24/18, 8:34:34 PM] Miller: If you turn 1 thousand dollars into 1 million through investing no logical person doesn't care if that million goes back to a thousand

[1/24/18, 8:37:21 PM] Launchpad: and if you sell every time theres a blip in the chart you have to pay taxes
[1/24/18, 8:40:54 PM] Miller: I mean first off who cares, you have to pay taxes eventually and secondly I'm not advocating you sell, I don't care if you sell or not, I take issue with the idea you don't care what happens to the price because your cost basis is so low
[1/24/18, 8:41:56 PM] Launchpad: of course I care about the price, I just don't care about that chart herman posted
[1/24/18, 8:42:47 PM] Miller: That's fine, I don't care about that either

[1/25/18, 9:47:57 AM] Launchpad: this is why 50 made that BTC https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/277lmj/its_50_cent_ask_me_anything/
[1/25/18, 9:48:12 AM] Launchpad: he promoted it on reddit
[1/25/18, 9:50:53 AM] Miller: my question was more what would drive anyone, let alone 10-15 THOUSAND people to pay for an album with bitcoin they could just as (or more) easily pay for using regular currency
[1/25/18, 9:51:21 AM] Miller: do i believe that 50 people probably did it for the lulz or as a gimmick? sure thats within the realm of plausibility
[1/25/18, 9:51:57 AM] Launchpad: because it 2014 everyone wanted to spent their btc profits from when it went over $1100
[1/25/18, 9:52:14 AM] Miller: it was $660
[1/25/18, 9:52:17 AM] Miller: and had not moved
[1/25/18, 9:52:20 AM] Miller: when the album was released
[1/25/18, 9:52:39 AM] Miller: not to mention people would be less likely to be using it as a currency if you owned it at 600 and it went to $1k
[1/25/18, 9:52:43 AM] Miller: b/c now its an investment
[1/25/18, 9:53:13 AM] Launchpad: or you don't want to pay taxes by selling out so you spend it
[1/25/18, 9:53:42 AM] Miller: yea the taxes you avoid by spending $15 on a 50 cent album must be massive
[1/25/18, 9:53:59 AM] Miller: i wonder if that is going to be the plot of OZARKS season 2
[1/25/18, 9:54:22 AM] Miller: michael bluthe launders cartel money by using bitcoin to buy hundreds of thousands of copies of 50 cents newest album
[1/25/18, 9:54:41 AM] Launchpad: probably
[1/25/18, 9:54:53 AM] Launchpad: cause everyone buying 50 cent albums has 100 million to spend
[1/25/18, 9:55:06 AM] Launchpad: look man you missed the boat
[1/25/18, 9:55:14 AM] Launchpad: cryptos made people rich and you don't understand it
[1/25/18, 9:55:24 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/25/18, 9:55:52 AM] Miller: is it "i dont have an answer so im going to just deflect and talk about how smart i am and how much money i made on bitcoin" time already?
[1/25/18, 9:55:57 AM] Miller: where does the time go
[1/25/18, 9:55:59 AM] Launchpad: no
[1/25/18, 9:56:12 AM] Miller: you dont have an answer b/c there is no logical answer
[1/25/18, 9:56:21 AM] Launchpad: if you have the bitcoin why WOULDN"T you spend it?
[1/25/18, 9:56:23 AM] Miller: which is why its most likely bullshit that 50 made anywhere close to that much money
[1/25/18, 9:56:41 AM] Launchpad: you have bitcoin and USD, and something is for sale in BTC and USD, who cares what you use to pay for it
[1/25/18, 9:57:01 AM] Miller: so the first question is why do you have bitcoin
[1/25/18, 9:57:05 AM] Miller: most people dont accidentally have bitcoin
[1/25/18, 9:57:12 AM] Miller: they bought it to spend on silk road most likely
[1/25/18, 9:57:24 AM] Launchpad: this is verifiable if you find the address in which he accepted donations
[1/25/18, 9:57:36 AM] Miller: ill let you scour the blockchain
[1/25/18, 9:58:43 AM] Miller: how many things have you bought and paid for in bitcoin?
[1/25/18, 9:58:54 AM] Miller: i mean you have bitcoin, why WOULDNT you spend it?
[1/25/18, 10:00:30 AM] Launchpad: do you spend all your money you earn? or do you spend some and save some
[1/25/18, 10:00:49 AM] Launchpad: I wouldn't spend BTC now cause transaction fees are through the roof BTC is broken
[1/25/18, 10:00:58 AM] Miller: so how much bitcoin have you spent on buying things?
[1/25/18, 10:01:00 AM] Miller: spend some, save some
[1/25/18, 10:01:04 AM] Miller: just curious what the breakdown is
[1/25/18, 10:01:15 AM] Launchpad: but in 2014 fees weren't an issue
[1/25/18, 10:02:06 AM] Miller: no fees? thats awesome, makes it free to convert your USD to bitcoin to buy an album that you could have just bought in USD w/o fees and saved yourself 30 min
[1/25/18, 10:02:29 AM] Launchpad: i didn't do the math
[1/25/18, 10:03:18 AM] Launchpad: no one used USD to buy bitcoin only so they could buy a 50 album, they already owned btc and its fucken very easy to send to another address
[1/25/18, 10:03:22 AM] Launchpad: this isn't rocket science
[1/25/18, 10:03:31 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/25/18, 10:03:45 AM] Launchpad: maybe people got into bitcoin because they were tired of all the banking scandals???
[1/25/18, 10:04:05 AM] Miller: presumably if they already owned bitcoin it was for a specific purpose, likely one which did not include purchasing a terrible 50 cent album
[1/25/18, 10:04:09 AM] Brian Katz: He started out as a chef. I know this from celebrity fit club
[1/25/18, 10:04:16 AM] Miller: crazy
[1/25/18, 10:05:30 AM] Launchpad: Its the future of money. Plain and simple. Its better technology than current money
[1/25/18, 10:05:35 AM] Launchpad: its free market money
[1/25/18, 10:06:03 AM] Miller: and were back to square 0
[1/25/18, 10:06:26 AM] Launchpad: Im good, its your own lack of understanding that this is a problem for
[1/25/18, 10:07:09 AM] Miller: i dont care how much you love bitcoin or blockchain, the fact its so hard for you to be objective about anything remotely related to the subject is insane
[1/25/18, 10:07:11 AM] Launchpad: its everywhere now and its not going away
[1/25/18, 10:07:20 AM] Miller: great, it was nowhere in 2014
[1/25/18, 10:07:24 AM] Launchpad: you are just as biased
[1/25/18, 10:07:26 AM] Miller: and nobody is using it to buy things now
[1/25/18, 10:07:30 AM] Miller: and even less people were using it in 2014
[1/25/18, 10:07:42 AM] Launchpad: wrong
[1/25/18, 10:07:52 AM] Launchpad: more people were because fees were affordable
[1/25/18, 10:07:57 AM] Miller: the odds of 50 cent getting 25 percent of his album sales is such a hilariously absurd prospect
[1/25/18, 10:08:02 AM] Launchpad: now people only use BTC as a gateway
[1/25/18, 10:08:35 AM] Launchpad: maybe but its one you cannot disprove unless you find his BTC address
[1/25/18, 10:08:59 AM] Miller: can you disprove right now that i am 9 feet tall?
[1/25/18, 10:09:28 AM] Launchpad: Ive seen you before
[1/25/18, 10:09:32 AM] Miller: you know you can use probabilities and logic to make reasonably good guesses even if you cannot definitively prove or disprove it, that is allowed
[1/25/18, 10:09:36 AM] Miller: but not now
[1/25/18, 10:09:39 AM] Miller: i grew 3 feet
[1/25/18, 10:09:46 AM] Miller: too bad you cannot disprove that
[1/25/18, 10:09:51 AM] Miller: therefore i am now 9 feet
[1/25/18, 10:10:06 AM] Miller: and 50 cent made 19 trillion $ on bitcoin by selling 800m copies of an album nobody bought
[1/25/18, 10:10:07 AM] Miller: which is true unless you disprove it
[1/25/18, 10:10:08 AM] Launchpad: If thats what he was going for, he went to the right place on reddit
[1/25/18, 10:10:41 AM] Miller: yea male 18-35 computer literate demographic, def not the #1 demographic most likely to pirate music
[1/25/18, 10:11:32 AM] Launchpad: def not the #1 demographic most likely to own BTC
[1/25/18, 10:12:52 AM] Launchpad: Look, I understand why you personally don't care about crypto and don't think you have a need for it in your life.  But failing to recognize why anyone else would is just being tone deaf
[1/25/18, 10:13:21 AM] Launchpad: Look I think Real Housewives tv is gutter trash, but I could understand that other people might find it entertaining
[1/25/18, 10:13:29 AM] Miller: and failing to be able to use any amount of logic and reasoning when it comes to anything related to the subject is also being tone deaf
[1/25/18, 10:13:41 AM] Launchpad: no its not
[1/25/18, 10:14:00 AM] Launchpad: if i own BTC and I own USD, and someone asks what I would like to pay with, why must I always use USD???
[1/25/18, 10:14:03 AM] Miller: if i make up a fake article that says cash me outside girl made $500m by selling copies of her appearance on dr phil for bitcoin im sure you would eat that up
[1/25/18, 10:14:27 AM] Launchpad: whats the logic in NOT using BTC.  Right now the logic in not using is for spending is the broken transaction fees
[1/25/18, 10:14:41 AM] Miller: its not hard to say hey something here doesnt seem right, this math seems unlikely
[1/25/18, 10:15:03 AM] Miller: you are allowed to question things you read on the internet, especially on TMZ, especially from a known bullshitter/liar
[1/25/18, 10:15:05 AM] Miller: that is allowed
[1/25/18, 10:15:40 AM] Launchpad: Im not commenting on the total sales he made, but fact is he did an AMA on reddit where he announced he was accepting crypto
[1/25/18, 10:15:57 AM] Miller: https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.37551/title.wale-dropped-1-1-million-on-uber
[1/25/18, 10:16:09 AM] Miller: if only he had paid for those uber rides using bicoin and we could get you to defend the likelihood of this
[1/25/18, 10:16:15 AM] Launchpad: 50 Cent vs who?????
[1/25/18, 10:16:51 AM] Miller: someone on the internet says something, it must be true
[1/25/18, 10:17:07 AM] Miller: god forbid anyone pokes holes into the likelihood of that
[1/25/18, 10:17:33 AM] Miller: totally likely some guy with like $5m net worth spent $1m on uber
[1/25/18, 10:17:45 AM] Miller: totally likely he took an uber from california to NY 3x/week
[1/25/18, 10:17:45 AM] Donk: no one questions the blockchain!
[1/25/18, 10:18:10 AM] Miller: i mean a private car/driver costs what? like $10m/yr so yea spending 1m/yr on uber seems super logical and likely
[1/25/18, 10:18:51 AM] Miller: but i do not in fact have access to wales bank account or uber account, so therefore it must be true bc i cannot disporve it
[1/25/18, 10:19:00 AM] Launchpad: except no one knows who the fuck Wale is but everyone on the planet knows who 50 is
[1/25/18, 10:26:56 AM] Launchpad: if you can find the address which he used to accept payment, you can find out how much he took in
[1/25/18, 10:27:13 AM] Launchpad: if you want to disprove your theory thats all you need to do
[1/25/18, 10:29:11 AM] Miller: and if you flew to NY you could measure my height
[1/25/18, 10:29:40 AM] Launchpad: except you can probably dig up his address in minutes
[1/25/18, 10:29:54 AM] Miller: go nuts

[1/25/18, 10:31:16 AM] Launchpad: Like I said I don't know or care how much he sold, but its not impossible
[1/25/18, 10:31:27 AM] Launchpad: if he wanted to collect btc, he advertised in the right place
[1/25/18, 10:31:43 AM] Launchpad: and whatever btc he collected is now worth ~20x as much
[1/25/18, 10:31:59 AM] Launchpad: good for him
[1/25/18, 10:33:25 AM] Launchpad: maybe you guys should hire him?
[1/25/18, 10:33:37 AM] Launchpad: 50 Cent, Money Maven

[1/25/18, 10:46:35 AM] Miller: sorry i already closed it
[1/25/18, 10:46:43 AM] Miller: but you can find his blockchain address to verify it
[1/25/18, 10:46:52 AM] Miller: cant be that hard, should only take a few minutes
[1/25/18, 10:47:48 AM] Miller: too bad you missed the boat, all these rappers beating you at your own game
[1/25/18, 10:48:22 AM] Donk: who is lil uzi yachty? ive heard of lil uzi vert, and lil yachty. is this their love child?
[1/25/18, 10:48:58 AM] Miller: hes raps blockchain billionare

[1/25/18, 11:37:41 AM] Miller: btw from that reddit AMA he was selling his album for $5.50, so forget my $15 estimate he must have now sold 3x as many copies as estimated to make $8m üòÇ
[1/25/18, 11:45:47 AM] Launchpad: like I said, Im not commenting on the number of albums he sold thats not my area
[1/25/18, 11:51:09 AM] Launchpad: anyways, if you want to get rich like 50, just buy some EOS now and forget about it for a few years

[1/25/18, 12:36:50 PM] Miller: theres also financial cuckolding

[1/25/18, 1:18:41 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/25/18, 1:19:18 PM] Miller: For his forthcoming book, "Tell Me What You Want: The Science of Sexual Desire and How It Can Help Improve Your Sex Life," Lehmiller surveyed thousands of Americans and found that 58% of men and about a third of women had fantasized about cuckolding.
[1/25/18, 1:19:20 PM] Miller: lol gtfoh
[1/25/18, 1:20:16 PM] Miller: if only you could buy his book using BTC so launchpad could scramble to defend those preposterous survey results
[1/25/18, 1:23:45 PM] Launchpad: apparently you don't like to listen. No one uses BTC for transactions in 2018 because BITCOIN HAS BECOME SO POPULAR that it can't handle its own transaction volume
[1/25/18, 1:24:43 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/25/18, 1:24:55 PM] Miller: ive been scouring the blockchain and lots of people are purchasing things with bitcoin
[1/25/18, 1:25:30 PM] Miller: i mean if you have bitcoin, why wouldn't you spend it?
[1/25/18, 1:26:12 PM] Launchpad: do you even know how to look at the blockchain?
[1/25/18, 1:26:45 PM] Launchpad: its a store of value
[1/25/18, 1:35:43 PM] Launchpad: Besides I wouldn't even bother with bitcoin these days. I could always be wrong of course (I'll have to put my shirt away), but I have never been more confident about a project than I am about EOS

[1/26/18, 3:01:00 PM] Miller: im picking the hunter and the rats
[1/26/18, 3:01:40 PM] Donk: the wolves might be pretty helpful
[1/26/18, 3:02:28 PM] Scott: why the rats?
[1/26/18, 3:02:29 PM] Dan Watts: Wolves and rats I'm good
[1/26/18, 3:02:39 PM] Miller: bc theres 10k of them
[1/26/18, 3:02:59 PM] Scott: im taking the wolves and lions
[1/26/18, 3:03:12 PM] Scott: wolves + lions + snoop lion  i'm good.
[1/26/18, 3:03:31 PM] Miller: my problem with not picking the hunter is im less concerned with him helping me defend myself and more concerned with him just shooting me and killing me if i dont pick him
[1/26/18, 3:04:26 PM] Miller: hawks were a popular pick on twitter
[1/26/18, 3:04:32 PM] Launchpad: you have to send the rats after the hunter
[1/26/18, 3:04:48 PM] Scott: yeah but, lets assume the hunter isnt indiana jones
[1/26/18, 3:04:53 PM] Scott: one of those big animals will kill him no problem
[1/26/18, 3:05:00 PM] Scott: especially with that gun he has reload time
[1/26/18, 3:05:11 PM] Miller: guess it depends on the skill of the hunter
[1/26/18, 3:05:31 PM] Miller: and the scenario, i was picturing like starting on a field across from each other where he could just shoot me
[1/26/18, 3:05:31 PM] Scott: maybe
[1/26/18, 3:05:33 PM] Scott: he also has a finite amount of bullets i would assume
[1/26/18, 3:05:56 PM] Miller: na infinite bullets
[1/26/18, 3:05:58 PM] Scott: going under the assumption he's first ogoing to kill you and not hte other animals
[1/26/18, 3:05:59 PM] Scott: the toher animals are more problematic to him than you
[1/26/18, 3:06:00 PM] Miller: is the way it was presented
[1/26/18, 3:06:15 PM] Scott: even infinite
[1/26/18, 3:06:15 PM] Scott: you aren't his biggest threat at all
[1/26/18, 3:06:19 PM] Miller: but if you could sick the hawks or rats on him would be a problem
[1/26/18, 3:06:32 PM] Scott: this isn't jumanji
[1/26/18, 3:06:32 PM] Miller: 50 hawks is a lot of hawks
[1/26/18, 3:06:36 PM] Scott: true
[1/26/18, 3:07:14 PM] Scott: even though its 10k rats
[1/26/18, 3:07:14 PM] Scott: what hey gonna do?
[1/26/18, 3:07:15 PM] Scott: assumign they work together
[1/26/18, 3:07:16 PM] Miller: if you pick hawks you can hide in a tree or something
[1/26/18, 3:07:29 PM] Miller: 10k rats could fuck up anything and everything
[1/26/18, 3:09:02 PM] Miller: Eagles can fly up to 100 mph and can see an animal the size of a rabbit 1 mile away. They get up to 7.5 foot wingspan
[1/26/18, 3:09:08 PM] Miller: fuck i think im taking eagles and rats now
[1/26/18, 3:09:30 PM] Brian Katz: Gorilla bear for the win Alex
[1/26/18, 3:10:34 PM] Miller: no chance
[1/26/18, 3:10:48 PM] Miller: you would have 1-2k rats on your face in no time
[1/26/18, 3:10:52 PM] Miller: if the hawks dont get you first
[1/26/18, 3:11:13 PM] Dan Watts: Rats have to be the #1 draft pick
[1/26/18, 3:11:17 PM] Scott: hawks/eagles are goood b/c hard to kill cause always on the move
[1/26/18, 3:11:33 PM] Dan Watts: I'm not scared of a hawk sorry
[1/26/18, 3:11:33 PM] Miller: plus they can grab you and fly you away to safety
[1/26/18, 3:11:33 PM] Miller: maybe
[1/26/18, 3:11:47 PM] Miller: 5 of them would come down and scoop you up
[1/26/18, 3:11:49 PM] Brian Katz: Fuck the rats, the hawks? My gorilla eats hawks all day
[1/26/18, 3:11:51 PM] Dan Watts: Dgaf how many there are
[1/26/18, 3:11:52 PM] Miller: and then drop you on your head from 10000 ft
[1/26/18, 3:11:56 PM] Scott: lol, a hawk cant carry you
[1/26/18, 3:12:03 PM] Miller: a hawk? no
[1/26/18, 3:12:07 PM] Miller: a bunch of hawks? sure
[1/26/18, 3:12:18 PM] Kiyoon: Rats don't attack people
[1/26/18, 3:12:24 PM] Kiyoon: Why you assuming that
[1/26/18, 3:12:30 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs not lord of the rings those bitches are endangered
[1/26/18, 3:12:31 PM] Miller: Large raptors, such as Red-tailed Hawks and Great Horned Owls, can attack and kill small pets. We have received dozens of inquiries about dogs and cats weighing anywhere from 6 to 60 pounds.
[1/26/18, 3:12:41 PM] Miller: 60lbs per hawk
[1/26/18, 3:12:49 PM] Kiyoon: I go hawks and lionz
[1/26/18, 3:13:04 PM] Miller: lions gonna be blind after my rats eat their eyeballs
[1/26/18, 3:13:07 PM] Miller: who wants a blind lion?
[1/26/18, 3:13:57 PM] Kiyoon: When was the last tikme any rat attacked a live bigger animal
[1/26/18, 3:14:02 PM] Kiyoon: Or rats
[1/26/18, 3:14:09 PM] Kiyoon: They may not work together
[1/26/18, 3:14:59 PM] Brian Katz: Their tails get all tangled up. Rats are bitches

[1/26/18, 3:15:55 PM] Miller: and those are mice not rats, so theyre friendly
[1/26/18, 3:16:46 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3fLpHEHFEU now im onto this
[1/26/18, 3:16:55 PM] Miller: just saw one take down a deer solo
[1/26/18, 3:17:35 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/26/18, 3:18:34 PM] Kiyoon: Yeah and the mice aren't doing anything
[1/26/18, 3:18:44 PM] Kiyoon: Sitting there all nimbly bimbly
[1/26/18, 3:19:19 PM] Miller: you have to assume you can focus them
[1/26/18, 3:19:33 PM] Miller: otherwise the rest of the animals are obviously just going to go off and do w/e
[1/26/18, 3:21:40 PM] Brian Katz: Now look up gorilla attacks
[1/26/18, 3:22:33 PM] Miller: Your search for "blind gorilla attacks" returned 0 results
[1/26/18, 3:22:38 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/26/18, 3:23:01 PM] Miller: if it was arm wrestling or bench press ill take the goriller
[1/26/18, 3:25:51 PM] Donk: hopefully he isnt indiana jones, indiana jones was a treasure hunter, not a regular hunter, indy's probably not very helpful in this situation
[1/26/18, 3:26:14 PM] Donk: id probably go hunter and wolves
[1/26/18, 3:26:29 PM] Launchpad: or capturing the hearts and minds of the world
[1/26/18, 3:26:36 PM] Donk: unless its indiana jones, in which case i go snakes and wolves
[1/26/18, 3:33:27 PM] Kiyoon: Also, would 10k rats stop a charging lion in 100 yards?
[1/26/18, 3:34:08 PM] Miller: probably
[1/26/18, 3:34:16 PM] Miller: scratch and claw eyes out
[1/26/18, 3:34:20 PM] Miller: go inside their mouth/throat
[1/26/18, 3:34:30 PM] Miller: attack them from the inside/choke to death
[1/26/18, 3:36:44 PM] Kiyoon: Not to deter the convo but I found something hilarious today
[1/26/18, 3:36:57 PM] Kiyoon: This is about Nikki Haley having an affair with Trump
[1/26/18, 3:37:02 PM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/26/18, 3:37:27 PM] Miller: bro 10k rats would demolish jenna jameson
[1/26/18, 3:37:30 PM] Scott: also
[1/26/18, 3:37:31 PM] Scott: rats dont die
[1/26/18, 3:37:36 PM] Scott: rats and mice are hard to kill
[1/26/18, 3:38:38 PM] Kiyoon: I thought @16316620763 would like that one
[1/26/18, 3:39:09 PM] Miller: @16316620763 is busy coding a simulation in python to determine the optimal outcome of the winner of the animal question
[1/26/18, 3:39:11 PM] Donk: if mice/rats are so hard to kill, why do simple pieces of wood and a spring take so many of them out?
[1/26/18, 3:39:27 PM] Kiyoon: And could rats claw through alligator skin
[1/26/18, 3:39:55 PM] Miller: they could from the inside
[1/26/18, 3:40:36 PM] Donk: the rats would really only be helpful is you could control them to a considerable degree
[1/26/18, 3:41:18 PM] Donk: like you need to be able to direct them overwhelm one of the other bigger animals
[1/26/18, 3:41:56 PM] Miller: i mean you have to have assumption of control over all the animals in this type of situaiton
[1/26/18, 3:42:07 PM] Miller: otherwise if you pick the wolves theyre just gonna go walk away
[1/26/18, 3:42:09 PM] Miller: or eat you
[1/26/18, 3:42:23 PM] Miller: the hawks are gonna fly away
[1/26/18, 3:42:36 PM] Donk: well i know it says that they will defnd you or attack you
[1/26/18, 3:42:43 PM] Donk: which is different from total control
[1/26/18, 3:42:51 PM] Miller: i think the idea is these animals will all be using theoretical optimal fighting strategies
[1/26/18, 3:43:09 PM] Miller: i dont need to control the rats, they can do their thing
[1/26/18, 3:43:21 PM] Donk: ok, then in that case, kinda hard not to choose the rats, they can probably overwhelm the larger ones easily
[1/26/18, 3:43:50 PM] Donk: and the hawks too
[1/26/18, 3:43:51 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/26/18, 3:44:04 PM] Miller: oh shit donk is team #RatsHawks
[1/26/18, 3:44:06 PM] Miller: i like it donk
[1/26/18, 3:44:36 PM] Donk: hawks go for the eyes, rats handle the takedowns, problem solved
[1/26/18, 3:44:55 PM] Miller: rats go for the eyes
[1/26/18, 3:45:00 PM] Miller: hawks pick them up and deposit them
[1/26/18, 3:45:17 PM] Miller: not sure 50 hawks could lift a goriller
[1/26/18, 3:45:23 PM] Miller: might only be an option for the smaller animals like wolves
[1/26/18, 3:45:28 PM] Launchpad: Wisdom of the crowd right here
[1/26/18, 3:45:36 PM] Donk: nah, i figure the hawks can take the eyes out like fawkes the phoenix did the basilisk in harry potter and the chamber of secrets
[1/26/18, 3:45:39 PM] Launchpad: we will find the optimal solution!
[1/26/18, 3:51:00 PM] Brian Katz: She fucked her way to success
[1/26/18, 3:52:08 PM] Brian Katz: All you rats and birds are bitches. Team 500lb mammals rules

[1/26/18, 3:54:20 PM] Miller: or do you remember when a gorilla was defeated by an infant child?
[1/26/18, 3:54:55 PM] Brian Katz: Harambe was gunned down
[1/26/18, 3:55:00 PM] Brian Katz: Dick out
[1/26/18, 3:55:17 PM] Launchpad: Remember when a pack of wild dogs/wolves raped his open wounds?
[1/26/18, 3:55:17 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/26/18, 3:55:43 PM] Launchpad: the bird may have taken his eye but the wolves took his innocence

[1/26/18, 3:55:56 PM] Dan Watts: This shit will change your mind about rats
[1/26/18, 4:17:22 PM] Launchpad: did anyone know about this show? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_Crowd
[1/26/18, 4:17:49 PM] Miller: richard jones is in it?
[1/26/18, 4:17:49 PM] Miller: but no
[1/26/18, 4:18:07 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/26/18, 4:18:09 PM] Launchpad: Jeremy Piven
[1/26/18, 4:24:00 PM] Brian Katz: it says on animal planet that a gorilla is faster than the fastest human being on earth and can benchpress over 4600 pounds. Their bite has more psi pressure than the great white shark.
[1/26/18, 4:25:57 PM] Dan Watts: Might change to gorillas and rats

[1/26/18, 4:29:03 PM] Miller: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[1/26/18, 4:30:07 PM] Miller: Does it say what they are going to do when 10 thousand ~hulkamaniacs~ rats go wild on them?
[1/26/18, 4:30:12 PM] Dan Watts: I might fuck with trump if he didn't have a twitter and wasn't a total maniac
[1/26/18, 4:31:06 PM] Donk: or you know, if he wasnt misogynist, xenophobic, racist, etc, etc
[1/26/18, 4:32:37 PM] Dan Watts: I think too many "ists" and "ics" are ascribed to him. I think he's just an asshole
[1/26/18, 4:33:03 PM] Justin: Can you explain what a 1.5 billion dollar contribution to pension plan is?
[1/26/18, 4:33:06 PM] Donk: i mean, grab em by the pussy, shithold countries, all mexicans are racist?
[1/26/18, 4:33:15 PM] Justin: I'm just curious wtf that means.
[1/26/18, 4:33:30 PM] Donk: meant all mexicans are murders there
[1/26/18, 4:33:42 PM] Donk: you can call him an asshole, but if the shoe fits....
[1/26/18, 4:34:29 PM] Dan Watts: I don't think the shithole countries thing was racist
[1/26/18, 4:34:43 PM] Donk: no, that was xenophobic
[1/26/18, 4:34:49 PM] Dan Watts: I don't want to be in a position where I'm defending him either
[1/26/18, 4:34:54 PM] Dan Watts: Def xenophobic
[1/26/18, 4:35:13 PM] Donk: though, probably also racist given that he was ok with the immigrants from Norway
[1/26/18, 4:36:06 PM] Donk: he is also clearly pretty incompetent at the job of actually being president
[1/26/18, 4:36:06 PM] Dan Watts: Norway objectively by all measurables better country than Haiti
[1/26/18, 4:36:22 PM] Justin: It's a joke anyway. The idea that the left has some high ground over some idiot because he called a place a shithole after they repeatedly crippled its economy and overthrew its democratically elected governance.....kinda nonsensical.
[1/26/18, 4:36:45 PM] Justin: Notice no discussion in the media of any of that
[1/26/18, 4:36:55 PM] Justin: But sun outrage over using a bad word
[1/26/18, 4:37:11 PM] Justin: Such*
[1/26/18, 4:37:13 PM] Donk: which country are you saying the "left" overthrew?
[1/26/18, 4:37:19 PM] Justin: Haiti
[1/26/18, 4:37:19 PM] Donk: (not that democrats are innocent)
[1/26/18, 4:37:37 PM] Justin: And crippled its economy.
[1/26/18, 4:37:43 PM] Justin: All under Clinton
[1/26/18, 4:38:01 PM] Justin: Then under bush
[1/26/18, 4:38:06 PM] Donk: i dont think the clinton overthrew the govt of haiti
[1/26/18, 4:39:53 PM] Justin: They never do
[1/26/18, 4:40:36 PM] Donk: well either way
[1/26/18, 4:40:48 PM] Donk: what clinton did has no bearing on what trump said
[1/26/18, 4:41:10 PM] Dan Watts: Grab em by the pussy
[1/26/18, 4:41:22 PM] Dan Watts: Stick a cigar in the pussy
[1/26/18, 4:41:23 PM] Justin: Ok but Haiti is in fact an economy that has been destroyed and impoverished by American imperialism.
[1/26/18, 4:41:29 PM] Justin: So what is worse?
[1/26/18, 4:41:35 PM] Donk: i have a feeling that clinton also grabbed them by the pussy
[1/26/18, 4:41:49 PM] Donk: you are changing the disucssion here herman
[1/26/18, 4:41:57 PM] Donk: this wasnt about us fucking over haiti
[1/26/18, 4:42:07 PM] Justin: Would ou be more offended to be called a shithole country. Or lose your job to Arkansas rice farm subsidized by us govt?
[1/26/18, 4:42:25 PM] Donk: this was about how trump wanted to stop immigants from the shithold countries, but is perfectly fine with them from lily white countries
[1/26/18, 4:42:33 PM] Miller: Goalposts!
[1/26/18, 4:42:46 PM] Donk: seriously
[1/26/18, 4:42:49 PM] Justin: I get that
[1/26/18, 4:43:07 PM] Justin: But the outrage is stupid
[1/26/18, 4:43:15 PM] Donk: is it though?
[1/26/18, 4:43:33 PM] Justin: Yes
[1/26/18, 4:43:35 PM] Donk: the outrage over our president making blantant racist/xenophobic  statements is stupid?
[1/26/18, 4:43:55 PM] Justin: Yes. Words are fucken meaningless
[1/26/18, 4:43:58 PM] Donk: you would rather them say, its fine, because someone else did some bad stuff 20 years ago?
[1/26/18, 4:44:00 PM] Justin: He's an asshole. We all know that
[1/26/18, 4:44:15 PM] Justin: It's not shocking he said something fucken stupid.
[1/26/18, 4:44:20 PM] Justin: And xenophobic
[1/26/18, 4:44:57 PM] Donk: its still better for their to be outrage and discussion rather than just sitting back and sitting quietly
[1/26/18, 4:44:59 PM] Justin: What is shocking is here we have him saying something about a country that is in fact mostly true, but it's true because American foreign policy made it true
[1/26/18, 4:45:40 PM] Justin: Now clearly what isn't true is the fact that it's a shithole has nothing to do with immigration
[1/26/18, 4:46:06 PM] Justin: Sorry not what isn't true.
[1/26/18, 4:46:19 PM] Justin: Clearly the fact that it's a shothole should mean we take more immigrants from there
[1/26/18, 4:46:22 PM] Donk: thats obviously what people were upset about
[1/26/18, 4:46:26 PM] Justin: Specifically because we made it a shithole
[1/26/18, 4:46:36 PM] Donk: its that hes ok with immigants from norway but not haiti
[1/26/18, 4:46:49 PM] Justin: I get that. But what do we get from that discussion?
[1/26/18, 4:46:57 PM] Justin: Who doesn't already know trump is an asshole?
[1/26/18, 4:47:09 PM] Donk: better that people talk than not talk
[1/26/18, 4:47:22 PM] Donk: sitting quietly and doing nothing would be far worse
[1/26/18, 4:47:26 PM] Justin: So you have all this media attention and they neglect to mention anything about our role in Asian economy
[1/26/18, 4:47:30 PM] Justin: Hatian*
[1/26/18, 4:48:09 PM] Justin: Personally you might win over some trump fanatics if you start agreeing that it's a shithole and explain why.
[1/26/18, 4:48:36 PM] Justin: Probably don't, but currently every single one of them is proud he "did what we're all thinking"
[1/26/18, 4:56:03 PM] Justin: @19732079889. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7jZGsf0Gruc
[1/26/18, 4:56:12 PM] Justin: He says it much more eloquently
[1/26/18, 4:57:13 PM] Miller: This is how you end voting for Jill Stein
[1/26/18, 5:00:33 PM] Justin: By listening to intercept, or mlk?
[1/26/18, 5:01:26 PM] Miller: By ending every discussion about trump being an asshole with some Clinton bombing or doing something to some country
[1/26/18, 5:02:25 PM] Justin: I'm sorry if history is inconvienant
[1/26/18, 5:02:45 PM] Miller: Idk you don't really seem that sorry iwbh
[1/26/18, 5:02:53 PM] Justin: The point being getting outraged by racist rhetoric as opposed to racist policy is pretty dumb
[1/26/18, 5:03:17 PM] Launchpad: you get outraged about everything
[1/26/18, 5:03:28 PM] Launchpad: you're getting outraged that people aren't outraged
[1/26/18, 5:03:30 PM] Justin: Unless you are saying that all that matters is appearance?
[1/26/18, 5:03:41 PM] Miller: You did get outraged about an article using the phrase liberal dose of salt
[1/26/18, 5:03:47 PM] Justin: Lol.
[1/26/18, 5:05:08 PM] Justin: I'm actually saying I'm not outraged at what trump said
[1/26/18, 5:05:26 PM] Justin: I think haiti is in fact a shithole
[1/26/18, 5:05:37 PM] Justin: And it's because of us policy.
[1/26/18, 5:05:51 PM] Justin: But please put me in a box. You love to do that

[1/27/18, 4:44:53 PM] Brian Katz: The last few seasons of sunny were great
[1/28/18, 12:14:08 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/28/18, 12:14:21 AM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôll take the tax one
[1/28/18, 12:14:37 AM] Miller: Depends how much I invested in bitcoin
[1/28/18, 12:15:04 AM] Brian Katz: Taxes blow
[1/28/18, 12:15:30 AM] Launchpad: yeah but like $100 of bitcoin in 2009 you'd be set for life
[1/28/18, 12:15:42 AM] Miller: Sure, but I wouldn't be paying taxes because I wouldn't be working if I had 100m of profits from bitcoin
[1/28/18, 12:15:56 AM] Brian Katz: This is true
[1/28/18, 12:16:30 AM] Brian Katz: How about you invested as much as you could‚Äôve invested back in 2009
[1/28/18, 12:16:33 AM] Miller: I think we're obviously all taking whichever one is the best financial option
[1/28/18, 12:17:04 AM] Miller: I'll take the bitcoin then
[1/28/18, 12:17:24 AM] Brian Katz: Somewhere Scotty is smiling
[1/28/18, 12:17:40 AM] Miller: It was a tenth of a penny or something, 50k in there I would be beyond set
[1/28/18, 12:18:11 AM] Miller: 500b? Idk I can't do that kind of math right now
[1/28/18, 12:18:44 AM] Brian Katz: You‚Äôd be the richest man on earth? lol
[1/28/18, 12:18:45 AM] Miller: I think it's 50b
[1/28/18, 12:19:10 AM] Miller: Either way, I'd be chilling, would not be worrying about taxes
[1/28/18, 12:19:32 AM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm changing my pill
[1/28/18, 12:24:01 AM] Brian Katz: Actually I‚Äôll take the invisible yo police. I‚Äôd just take whatever I needed
[1/28/18, 12:30:20 AM] Launchpad: I think if you were as smart as Nikola Tesla you would have invested in Bitcoin in 2009 though localbitcoins or with the tor browser and you'd be invisible to police while tax exempt for life
[1/28/18, 12:31:26 AM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm taking the invisible by police as a gta type of thing where I can do whatever I want lol
[1/28/18, 12:31:55 AM] Miller: Police just gonna throw a sheet on you and then shoot you
[1/28/18, 12:32:04 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[1/28/18, 12:32:08 AM] Miller: Haven't you seen any movies with invisible men
[1/28/18, 12:32:19 AM] Brian Katz: I thought that meant tat they wouldn‚Äôt bother me at al
[1/28/18, 3:54:45 PM] Justin: If anyone is looking for a Netflix binge show "dark". It's like stranger things meets a murder mystery. It's German show and dubbing in English is worse than the room, but still worth it.
[1/28/18, 4:45:07 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/28/18, 9:30:17 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/29/18, 8:46:34 AM] Miller: im shocked chance didnt win best new artist @ the grammys
[1/29/18, 8:49:58 AM] Donk: jayz got completely shut out?
[1/29/18, 8:50:09 AM] Donk: (didnt watch any of it, just looking at the winners now)
[1/29/18, 8:50:45 AM] Miller: dont think jay won anything, sza got shut out despite having the most nominations
[1/29/18, 8:50:51 AM] Miller: i think basically bruno mars and kendrick won everything
[1/29/18, 8:51:07 AM] Miller: and then the rest of the show was spent on u2 and sting for obvious reasons
[1/29/18, 8:51:08 AM] Donk: a leonard cohen song won best rock perforamnce? lol, thats weird
[1/29/18, 8:51:37 AM] Dan Watts: Despacito should've won song of year
[1/29/18, 8:51:44 AM] Brian Katz: Could there be a more meaningless award show then the Grammies?
[1/29/18, 8:52:06 AM] Miller: MTV music awards?
[1/29/18, 8:52:08 AM] Miller: BET awards?
[1/29/18, 8:52:17 AM] Miller: nick teen choice awards?
[1/29/18, 8:52:45 AM] Brian Katz: Bet awards lol
[1/29/18, 8:54:15 AM] Brian Katz: Award shows in general are pretty stupid.
[1/29/18, 8:54:59 AM] Sean: I thought the Grammies were a big deal
[1/29/18, 8:55:01 AM] Miller: i truly dont understand how it works, gambino album good enough to be nominated for AOTY but not good enough to win best contemporary r&b or w/e the fuck that category is called
[1/29/18, 8:55:04 AM] Sean: As far as award shows go
[1/29/18, 8:55:14 AM] Miller: if the weeknd wins that why was he not nominated for AOTY?
[1/29/18, 8:55:26 AM] Miller: theres a huge lack of logical consistency there
[1/29/18, 8:56:58 AM] Brian Katz: Like how cheeses plays basketball every Sunday morning, but has never played basketball any Sunday morning. Like come on now.
[1/29/18, 10:17:11 AM] Launchpad: as well as musical diversity
[1/29/18, 1:09:21 PM] Miller: if anyone has any points on Chase UR from that chase sapphire rewards deal lmk if you want to sell them to me
[1/29/18, 1:17:58 PM] Kiyoon: why you buying points
[1/29/18, 1:19:26 PM] Miller: the value translation on this hotel is better than paying cash
[1/29/18, 1:24:50 PM] Miller: disregard cannot xfer them, i misread it
[1/29/18, 1:45:16 PM] Miller: goddamn hawaii is expensive, basically just booked a 2nd honeymoon
[1/29/18, 1:48:50 PM] Donk: Yeah, worth it though.  Where in Hawaii?
[1/29/18, 1:49:05 PM] Miller: im spending 3 nights in lanai and 3 nights in maui
[1/29/18, 1:49:25 PM] Launchpad: I hear the spam is good out there
[1/29/18, 1:49:29 PM] Donk: Nice, thatll be great
[1/29/18, 1:49:42 PM] Miller: first vacation w/o kids
[1/29/18, 1:49:47 PM] Donk: Mcdonalds swlls spam and eggs
[1/29/18, 1:49:51 PM] Miller: so def looking forward to it
[1/29/18, 1:50:42 PM] Brian Katz: When you looking to go?
[1/29/18, 1:51:13 PM] Miller: im going 6/6-6/12
[1/29/18, 1:51:41 PM] Brian Katz: You should go now, the weather sucks here lol.
[1/29/18, 1:52:07 PM] Miller: one of nicoles friends is getting married so that was initial reason for the trip
[1/29/18, 1:52:17 PM] Launchpad: cool we'll have the draft out there too
[1/29/18, 1:52:33 PM] Miller: sounds good
[1/29/18, 1:54:18 PM] Donk: Probably closer to you than alot of the possible draft cities lol
[1/29/18, 1:55:06 PM] Miller: the day LP spends $700/night on a hotel room will be the official 1st sign of the apocalypse
[1/29/18, 1:55:34 PM] Launchpad: Ill do it before cheese
[1/29/18, 1:55:42 PM] Miller: lol
[1/29/18, 1:55:43 PM] Miller: low bar
[1/29/18, 1:56:00 PM] Launchpad: theres a method to my madness
[1/29/18, 1:56:24 PM] Miller: i think everyone understands the value of not spending money
[1/29/18, 1:56:26 PM] Launchpad: its called 'Im not retiring at 65'
[1/29/18, 1:56:39 PM] Miller: its not a groundreaking or unique concept
[1/29/18, 1:56:53 PM] Launchpad: you would think...but not many people seem to really grasp the concept
[1/29/18, 1:57:59 PM] Miller: jews have been passing down these teachings for generations
[1/29/18, 1:58:27 PM] Launchpad: and yet only 1% of the population subscribes to the teachings of the jews
[1/29/18, 1:59:58 PM] Launchpad: but $700 a night for 6 nights is a bit over the top...I hope thats all inclusive
[1/29/18, 2:00:29 PM] Miller: it is not
[1/29/18, 2:00:43 PM] Miller: i do get a $200 daily resort credit which will almost certainly end with me spending more $
[1/29/18, 2:01:04 PM] Miller: and i used points for 1/2 of it which basically means that part was free
[1/29/18, 2:01:11 PM] Miller: and i got a good deal on the airfare
[1/29/18, 2:01:19 PM] Miller: so w/e
[1/29/18, 2:55:00 PM] Justin: @16195657200  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tax-overhaul-will-have-a-limited-effect-on-us-economy-moodys-says-2018-01-25?link=sfmw_tw
[1/29/18, 2:55:23 PM] Justin: More winning by trump.
[1/29/18, 2:59:04 PM] Kiyoon: All these companies are giving 1K bonuses though!!
[1/29/18, 3:01:01 PM] Miller: yes the annual xmas bonus tradition was just recently started by trump
[1/29/18, 3:01:17 PM] Kiyoon: that was sarcasm
[1/29/18, 3:03:17 PM] Justin: Yeh that is actually addressed in the article as well lol. But I mean Goldman Sachs has a lot of incentive to claim tax reform will not raise wages in the economy, can't trust those commies
[1/29/18, 3:05:10 PM] Kiyoon: all these bonuses being given out, govt taxing them at 40%
[1/29/18, 3:05:33 PM] Kiyoon: money going right back to the govt...smart plan by Trump???
[1/29/18, 3:07:54 PM] Miller: ............no
[1/29/18, 3:08:00 PM] Justin: But their former CEO declaring it 100% will raise wages, very trushworthy. That's why he left that bottom of the barrel private sector job, to take such a difficult publically held cabinet position. Everyone knows that public officials and pr reports are trustworthy economic indicators.
[1/29/18, 3:08:20 PM] Miller: probably less than 1% of the cost of the corporate tax cuts is being recouped by taxing peoples bonuses
[1/29/18, 3:08:49 PM] Justin: It's actually genius considering half of it is in stock bonuses
[1/29/18, 4:05:27 PM] Justin: Just Finished the dark on Netflix. Needs to go to the top of everyone's watch list
[1/29/18, 4:05:56 PM] Miller: above or below mindhunter
[1/29/18, 4:06:00 PM] Miller: which i also have not started
[1/29/18, 4:17:57 PM] Justin: i only watched first couple episodes of mind hunter when it was on tv, haven't finished it on netflix yet....i'd say above
[1/29/18, 4:18:13 PM] Justin: it's a complete mindfuck of a story
[1/29/18, 4:18:27 PM] Brian Katz: I liked that show a lot
[1/29/18, 4:18:27 PM] Launchpad: would that put it above or below Disjointed?
[1/29/18, 4:19:05 PM] Donk: disjointed was so bad
[1/29/18, 4:19:14 PM] Donk: couldnt make it through 2 epsidoes
[1/29/18, 4:19:15 PM] Launchpad: how much did you watch?
[1/29/18, 4:19:18 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/29/18, 4:19:19 PM] Justin: didnt watch disjointed, cant comment.  Weeds last 3 seasons did enough damage to me that i will never invest in a weed show again
[1/29/18, 4:19:30 PM] Launchpad: it actually gets better I swear
[1/29/18, 4:19:37 PM] Launchpad: 2 completely completely different shows
[1/29/18, 4:19:46 PM] Donk: it almost isnt possible for it be worse
[1/29/18, 4:19:52 PM] Launchpad: lol true
[1/29/18, 4:19:56 PM] Donk: but no, im not giving it another chance
[1/29/18, 4:20:03 PM] Donk: its dead to me
[1/29/18, 4:20:09 PM] Launchpad: its very cringeworthy bad, but it has some funny lines
[1/29/18, 4:20:30 PM] Launchpad: it was much worse in the beginning...somehow I powered through and it came somewhat enjoyable
[1/29/18, 4:20:36 PM] Justin: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856/
[1/29/18, 4:20:54 PM] Launchpad: did you watch the OA?
[1/29/18, 4:21:00 PM] Launchpad: thats a pretty good mindfuck show too
[1/29/18, 4:21:04 PM] Justin: yeh imagine the OA, but doesnt suck
[1/29/18, 4:21:04 PM] Donk: yeah, saying it becomes somewhat enjoyable doesnt really make me want to go watch anymore of it
[1/29/18, 4:21:10 PM] Launchpad: lol
[1/29/18, 4:21:12 PM] Donk: i did finish catching up on traverlers over the weekend
[1/29/18, 4:21:19 PM] Justin: thats how id best describe dark
[1/29/18, 4:21:20 PM] Donk: i hope it gets renewed for another one
[1/29/18, 4:21:36 PM] Launchpad: they gotta, they set up that huge cliffhanger
[1/29/18, 4:21:49 PM] Launchpad: they can go so many directions with that story
[1/29/18, 4:22:14 PM] Miller: lol OA was like oh this could be interesting but ended up being pretty lamew
[1/29/18, 4:22:19 PM] Justin: http://ew.com/tv/2017/12/18/the-oa-season-2-filming/
[1/29/18, 4:22:44 PM] Launchpad: it definitely got more weird towards the end but Ill watch OA S2
[1/29/18, 4:23:03 PM] Launchpad: Ash Vs Evil Dead just came to Netflix -- S3 comes out in a month
[1/29/18, 4:23:03 PM] Miller: yea im gonna end up watching it as well
[1/29/18, 4:23:11 PM] Launchpad: Ash Vs Evil Dead is awesome
[1/29/18, 4:23:45 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah it was
[1/29/18, 4:46:40 PM] Donk: i was watching the 2018 xgames a couple of nights ago and all of the sudden, the break in the middle of an event for a special musical guest, and its method man and redman doing a performance of da rockwilder
[1/29/18, 4:46:52 PM] Donk: i had to look at my phone to make sure it was in fact still 2018
[1/29/18, 4:48:52 PM] Scott: Classic song. How was it?
[1/29/18, 4:49:06 PM] Donk: terrible as you would expect in 2018

[1/29/18, 4:51:41 PM] Miller: whover runs marketing for taco bell is severely underpaid
[1/29/18, 4:51:57 PM] Launchpad: so now theres finally no reason to go to del taco
[1/29/18, 5:05:49 PM] Miller: https://twitter.com/BruhReport/status/958056416178139136 this is great
[1/29/18, 5:09:55 PM] Donk: the best part is that because hes some rich guying with a front row seat, they just escort him back to his seat with a stern talking to
[1/29/18, 5:10:10 PM] Miller: wonder how long he had been planning that
[1/29/18, 5:10:17 PM] Scott: the injustice.
[1/29/18, 5:10:58 PM] Miller: would be a travesty to be ejected for that, totally harmless and funny as hell
[1/29/18, 5:12:21 PM] Donk: i do agree with that
[1/29/18, 5:12:29 PM] Donk: however, still gotta take that shit seriously and eject people
[1/29/18, 5:12:43 PM] Donk: cant be letting whoever dresses up in warmups to come run the layup line every game
[1/29/18, 6:09:21 PM] Launchpad: Do accountants have client confidentiality agreements like doctors and attorneys?
[1/29/18, 6:09:53 PM] Scott: Unsure but they Definetely have a fiduciary obligation.

[1/30/18, 7:45:57 AM] Miller: 32% of all U.S. Tweets in 2017 mentioned Trump
[1/30/18, 7:46:00 AM] Miller: holy fuck
[1/30/18, 10:17:32 AM] Launchpad: i knew twitter sucked
[1/30/18, 10:18:41 AM] Miller: twitter is the best
[1/30/18, 10:18:52 AM] Miller: i owe at least 10% of my LXFG title to twitter
[1/30/18, 10:19:23 AM] Miller: (the other 90% goes to todd gurley)
[1/30/18, 11:25:26 AM] Miller: $450 fee, $300 on travel, question was where to make up the other 150
[1/30/18, 11:25:25 AM] Miller: i decided im gonna end up keeping this fancy chase sapphire reserve card
[1/30/18, 11:25:26 AM] Miller: if i spend 10k/yr on things they give me 3x points for (travel including LIRR and food) that is 3k points vs 1k points at amex, that would be ~$200 difference right there, however the chase points are worth ~1.5x if redeemed for travel so it actually ends up being like a $350/yr difference
[1/30/18, 11:26:09 AM] Launchpad: dude get the Uber card
[1/30/18, 11:26:50 AM] Miller: im not getting the uber card
[1/30/18, 11:26:54 AM] Launchpad: 4x on restaurants, 3x points on hotels & airlines, 2x on internet/uber purchases and no foreign tx fees
[1/30/18, 11:27:15 AM] Launchpad: also $50 in streaming service credits
[1/30/18, 11:27:21 AM] Miller: what i have learned is points are not equal
[1/30/18, 11:27:30 AM] Miller: $700/night hotel would have cost me 150k in amex points
[1/30/18, 11:27:34 AM] Miller: it cost me 35k in chase points
[1/30/18, 11:27:35 AM] Launchpad: lol i haven't learned that
[1/30/18, 11:27:50 AM] Kiyoon: Millz you also get priority pass for free
[1/30/18, 11:28:03 AM] Miller: yep
[1/30/18, 11:28:04 AM] Kiyoon: also global entry paid for
[1/30/18, 11:28:11 AM] Launchpad: in the case of the uber card, the X just means %
[1/30/18, 11:28:15 AM] Kiyoon: priority pass alone i think is worth it to have the chase card
[1/30/18, 11:28:32 AM] Miller: theres a ton of other good benefits, i just wasnt sure it was worth the $150, now that i am confident the $150 will actually be more than offset just on the benefits its a no brainer
[1/30/18, 11:28:46 AM] Miller: price protection, roadside assistance all sorts of shit
[1/30/18, 11:28:50 AM] Launchpad: for the Uber card, the X is the percentage, not the points
[1/30/18, 11:29:09 AM] Kiyoon: yeah also hard to beat the 3X points at bars restaurants
[1/30/18, 11:29:13 AM] Launchpad: 4% back on restaurants itself is massive
[1/30/18, 11:29:22 AM] Kiyoon: considering that is probably most of my purchases
[1/30/18, 11:29:35 AM] Launchpad: unless you have the Uber card üòÇ
[1/30/18, 11:29:48 AM] Miller: lets say i spend 10k on restaurants LP, so i could get $300 in points from chase or $400 in cash back from uber
[1/30/18, 11:29:57 AM] Miller: those $300 chase points are worth $450 if i use them for travel
[1/30/18, 11:30:14 AM] Launchpad: gotcha
[1/30/18, 11:30:23 AM] Launchpad: its the chase points which aren't by percent
[1/30/18, 11:30:47 AM] Miller: they are by %
[1/30/18, 11:30:52 AM] Launchpad: thats why I hate all these goddamn reward point systems. They purposely obfuscate them to confuse you and it becomes gambling
[1/30/18, 11:31:21 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/30/18, 11:31:52 AM] Miller: until i went through and actually tried to use all these points (amex, chase, bank of hawaii mastercard) i did not appreciate the difference in them
[1/30/18, 11:31:57 AM] Miller: figured points were points were points
[1/30/18, 11:33:06 AM] Kiyoon: yeah its a difference
[1/30/18, 11:33:14 AM] Kiyoon: I have ot screenshot it but check this out for delta
[1/30/18, 11:37:02 AM] Kiyoon: hmm I can't seem to find it now but when I was looking for airfare tickets to St Croix, Delta had it where you can use points+cash, and it'd be use 15K points+$145
[1/30/18, 11:37:11 AM] Kiyoon: ....that flight when i looked to pay just cash was $142
[1/30/18, 11:37:20 AM] Kiyoon: I think that's on the extreme end of points
[1/30/18, 11:37:28 AM] Kiyoon: of "using points"
[1/30/18, 11:43:10 AM] Dan Watts: Anyone remember that tall Indian kid Vik from chi phi? Anyway I may have had 4 conversations with him 10 years ago in Binghamton. Now he's an attorney and I see him in court and he acts like we were bffs at Binghamton. Very strange
[1/30/18, 11:43:31 AM] Miller: doesnt ring any bells
[1/30/18, 11:43:47 AM] Miller: rainer and howie only ppl i remember
[1/30/18, 11:44:04 AM] Miller: some say hes still being held back to this day
[1/30/18, 12:02:10 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[1/30/18, 12:15:58 PM] Miller: what is a worse response to someone asking you to do something? "sure" or "K"?
[1/30/18, 12:16:36 PM] Launchpad: k
[1/30/18, 12:18:45 PM] Donk: if you add a period after the K. it becomes even worse
[1/30/18, 12:18:59 PM] Launchpad: lol def
[1/30/18, 12:19:12 PM] Donk: i know im in the dog house if i get a "K."
[1/30/18, 12:19:20 PM] Donk: or a "Fine."

Firms say they routinely get ‚Äòlegal process‚Äô from regulators
Tether has yet to verify that it holds $2.3 billion in reserveBy¬†Matthew Leising
(Bloomberg) --¬†U.S. regulators are scrutinizing one of the world‚Äôs largestcryptocurrency¬†exchanges as questions mount over a digital token linked to its backers.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas last week to¬†virtual-currency venue Bitfinex and Tether, a company that issues a widely traded coin and claims it‚Äôs pegged to the dollar, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The firms share the same chief executive officer.
Tether‚Äôs coins have become a popular substitute for dollars on cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, with about $2.3 billion of the tokens outstanding as of Tuesday. While Tether has said all of its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve, the company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings to the public or have its accounts audited. Skeptics have questioned whether the money is really there.
‚ÄúWe routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations,‚Äù Bitfinex and Tether said Tuesday in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúIt is our policy not to comment on any such requests.‚Äù

[1/30/18, 1:22:21 PM] Miller: Surprise Bonus Payouts Spur Re-Examination of Trump‚Äôs Tax Cuts
2018-01-30 15:40:00.0 GMT


By Matt Townsend and Elena Popina
(Bloomberg) -- Just how much of this Trump tax cut will
really trickle down?
Since Republican leaders pushed through their once-in-a-
generation tax overhaul, more than 70 major U.S. companies --
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Apple Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. -- have announced either pay raises or bonuses for rank-and-
file employees, or more hiring and investment.
That‚Äôs not all that many -- there are over 3,500 publicly
traded corporations in the U.S., after all. And to some, they
amount to little more than well-timed PR stunts designed to
curry favor with the public and the president. But they‚Äôve been
enough to get some analysts rethinking just how much the $1.5
trillion package of cuts might benefit ordinary Americans and
the broader economy.
One thing‚Äôs pretty certain: This is a good moment for
workers. A tight labor market has pushed unemployment to
historic lows and many economists see wage gains just around the
corner. On top of that comes the big tax cut, which may
encourage more companies to pass some of the savings onto
employees, instead of simply reward shareholders.
‚ÄúIf the unemployment rate were 8 or 10 percent, you
wouldn‚Äôt be seeing a lot of these announcements,‚Äù said Stephen
Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
Companies would still be investing in their businesses, but the
‚Äúwage piece of it is probably driven primarily by the labor
market.‚Äù
Of course, the benefits aren‚Äôt exactly raining down and
most say it‚Äôs too early to tell if any of this will give a
meaningful boost to growth. But for some, the trickle from the
top -- a classic supply-side approach championed by Republicans
-- has been a little bigger than initially expected.
With corporate profits as a share of GDP close to the
highest levels in 70 years and labor‚Äôs share near an all-time
low, some say something had to give.
Now, after the tax rewrite pushed the corporate rate down
from 35 percent to 21 percent, executives may feel more
compelled to share the savings, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. Even before the tax cut, a number of businesses like Wal-
Mart were struggling to retain good help as an upswing in the
economy pushed the jobless rate down to 4.1 percent.
‚ÄúCompetition for customers and employees may claim part of
the potential tax benefit,‚Äù David Kostin, a strategist at
Goldman Sachs, wrote this month.
With their slew of splashy announcements, there‚Äôs no
question companies are trying hard to counter the perception
they‚Äôre only interested in rewarding shareholders and offshoring
American jobs to maximize profits.

Tweeter In Chief

It doesn‚Äôt mean companies can‚Äôt quietly do buybacks later,
but it‚Äôs likely a number of them were already thinking about pay
raises and hiring. Putting them front and center gives
corporations the chance to deliver a high-profile thank-you to
the Trump administration for the tax windfall. (Not to mention
an opportunity to get a personal shoutout from the tweeter in
chief, who will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday.)
Amherst Pierpont‚Äôs Stanley says it ultimately doesn‚Äôt
matter why companies are investing more in their workers and
businesses. The bottom line is they‚Äôre doing it, and he says
that will help economic growth top 3 percent this year -- more
bullish than any of the 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Most agree the tax overhaul will be a plus, at least in the
short term. But just how much it ultimately moves the needle is
up for debate. Since November, economists have started to slowly
inch up their projections. They currently expect the economy to
expand 2.6 percent this year and spending on plants and
equipment to rise 6 percent. It would be a welcome lift after
both growth and capex languished in recent years.
Nevertheless, the projections are well short of the ‚Äú4, 5,
even 6 percent‚Äù economic growth President Donald Trump has
repeatedly promised to deliver.

PR Panacea

‚ÄúOverall, it‚Äôs a net positive,‚Äù said Savita Subramanian,
the head of U.S. equities and quantitative strategy at Bank of
America Corp. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs a panacea, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs not
like tax reform really drove a reason for companies to spend.
The tax reform happened when the economy was also improving.
It‚Äôs hard to say how much the improvement in the economy is tax-
related versus the normal pickup in economic activity.‚Äù
One reason for the uncertainty is that while companies have
been long on hoopla, they‚Äôve been short on meaningful context or
comparisons.
For example, it‚Äôs hard to know whether Apple‚Äôs five-year,
$30 billion U.S. spending pledge is a significant increase. In
the prior five years, Apple‚Äôs capex totaled $55 billion
worldwide. (It doesn‚Äôt break out spending regionally.) Same goes
for its hiring plan. Twenty-thousand new jobs sounds like a lot,
but Apple‚Äôs global workforce has grown over twice as much since
2012. Spokesman Josh Rosenstock didn‚Äôt immediately respond to
requests for comment.
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt heard a lot of specific steps,‚Äù said Matt
Maley, a strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. Some of what we have
heard, like the one-time bonuses, are ‚Äúmore PR than the real
thing.‚Äù
Much was made of Wal-Mart‚Äôs wage bump and its $1,000 bonus
because of how many low-income Americans it employs, but
spokesman Kory Lundberg said at the time that a ‚Äúsizable group‚Äù
of its 4,700 U.S. stores already pay $11 an hour due to state
minimum-wage laws. In fact, the $1 wage hike was the retailer‚Äôs
third in as many years and ‚Äúpart of a longer-term trend‚Äù in the
industry, says David Schick, director of research for Consumer
Edge Research. Wal-Mart spokesman Blake Jackson declined to
comment.
To be fair, there‚Äôs little doubt businesses really do
prefer a staunchly pro-business administration intent on
slashing taxes and rolling back regulations. After years of
uncertainty, the rewrite not only gives companies a big
windfall, but it also provides a permanent, low-cost way for
them to repatriate trillions of dollars in untaxed overseas
profits. Business confidence, which stagnated during the Obama
years, is now sky-high.

Confidence Game

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a confidence thing,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs
Subramanian. ‚ÄúIf they were holding back on spending because they
didn‚Äôt know what the tax law is going to look like, now they
have it all clear.‚Äù
Regardless of how it plays out, the booming stock market
itself may lead CEOs to favor investment and labor over buybacks
and dividends. That, and the fact the tax cut is coming at a
time when the economy is humming along.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt expect companies to redeploy as much capital‚Äù to
shareholders, Subramanian said. ‚ÄúFor the first time I can think
of, we are having this massive stimulus occur within an
improving, and already reasonably healthy, economic backdrop.
That‚Äôs what might be a bigger driver of capital expenditures or
spending on growth.‚Äù
[1/30/18, 1:25:09 PM] Justin: http://cepr.net/blogs/beat-the-press/early-reviews-of-tax-cut-are-not-good-capital-goods-orders-fall-in-december
[1/30/18, 1:26:07 PM] Justin: if the tax rate is really a big deal for investment decisions, then corporate America should have been putting together its list of likely projects as soon as a big tax cut became a clear possibility back in September. By December, forward-looking firms should have been ready to jump as soon as they knew the tax cut would be a reality.

This means that we should have seen at least some of these orders being registered before the end of the year. The fact that there is zero evidence of any uptick suggests that investment decisions are not as sensitive to tax rates as claimed.

It is, of course, early ‚Äî maybe the January data will tell a different story. But so far, it doesn't look the Republicans have much of a case. The tax cuts definitely made the rich richer, at this point we don't have much evidence they will help anyone else.

[1/30/18, 4:04:17 PM] Miller: @16195657200 if you really want to crush your uber card
[1/30/18, 4:04:18 PM] Miller: Also, if you really want to game the system, you should have a Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Freedom, and Chase Freedom Unlimited. The Freedom card gives 5 ultimate rewards (‚ÄúUR‚Äù) points for every dollar spent in certain categories that rotate every 3 months (up to $1,500 for that 3 month period). The Unlimited card gives 1.5 UR points for all purchases. And, as you know but I‚Äôm stating for other people who may read his, the Sapphire Reserve returns 3 UR points for every purchase on dining (thankfully includes bars) or travel. It also gives a 50% boost to any UR points used to make travel purchases on UR‚Äôs website (so Reserve points are worth 4.5 points if the kicker alllies). Since UR points can be transferred between cards, this means the 1.5 points earned on any purchase on a Chase Freedom unlimted card are actually worth 2.25 if transferred to a linked Reserve card and spent on travel through the UR website. Likewise, the 5 points earned on the Freedom card for purchases in that wuarter‚Äôs cateotey are worth 7.5 points (if transferred to the Reserve card‚Äôs UR and spent on travel through Chase‚Äôs website).

Flow chat to maximize UR points (in descending order):

1) if I‚Äôm buying something in the Freedom categories and I haven‚Äôt made $1,500 in such purchases during the quarter, I use the Freedom Card (7.5 point return)

2) if (1) above doesn‚Äôt apply and the purchase dining (includes bars, Grubhub, etc) or travel (includes flights, subway, trains, buses), then I use Sapphire Reserve card (4.5 point return); and

3) if neither (1) or (2) applies, I use the Chase Freedom unlimted for all other purchases (2.25 point return)

Then, every few months (and definitely before buying tickets), I transfer the UR points from the Freedom and Freedom Unlimted cards to the Sapphire Reserve card.

This enables me to get a minim of 2.25 points on any purchase, and as much as 7.5 points.

[1/31/18, 2:07:36 PM] Justin: Well I'm assuming we're paying 36% ish
[1/31/18, 2:08:08 PM] Miller: yea i had wrong # in my head but no you should def still take the lump sum
[1/31/18, 2:08:13 PM] Justin: And at 96 a year taxed at 18%ish
[1/31/18, 2:08:49 PM] Justin: If we're 18 life expectancy of 55 years
[1/31/18, 2:09:17 PM] Justin: Which would pay out about 5 million taxes at 18% year
[1/31/18, 2:09:38 PM] Justin: Idk, itsnpretty fucken complex
[1/31/18, 2:11:02 PM] Justin: Chances are our spending habits will be excessive given upfront sum as well
[1/31/18, 2:11:34 PM] Justin: Like if we "invest" in a house for 500k.
[1/31/18, 2:11:47 PM] Donk: well now you are making it more complex
[1/31/18, 2:11:48 PM] Justin: Which most people would likely do.
[1/31/18, 2:12:02 PM] Donk: its a simple question of long term value if only invest it and dont spend it
[1/31/18, 2:12:05 PM] Justin: lol that's why I exist in this chat donk
[1/31/18, 2:12:31 PM] Donk: but yes, if you buy the whole town ice cream 5 days a week, its going to make it more difficult
[1/31/18, 2:13:29 PM] Donk: i do know that if you take the lump sum and invest it only in weed stocks and LP approved cryptos and grab your sack, you are sure to profit tremendously
[1/31/18, 2:13:35 PM] Donk: (the sack grabbing being the most important)
[1/31/18, 2:13:41 PM] Justin: Idk I think investing in a house would be pretty logical prudent, but would kill much of or compounding interest
[1/31/18, 2:13:43 PM] Miller: üöÄ
[1/31/18, 2:13:52 PM] Justin: Lol
[1/31/18, 2:14:00 PM] Justin: Hot take of the day
[1/31/18, 2:14:06 PM] Launchpad: üåï
[1/31/18, 2:14:15 PM] Miller: i mean you could also just take that 1.2m and go to texas or w/e and buy a house for 250k cash and retire
[1/31/18, 2:14:41 PM] Miller: or you could take it and put it as a down payment on a 4m shed in SF and be super poor
[1/31/18, 2:15:42 PM] Launchpad: I think most of us will go this route so we have something to complain about
[1/31/18, 2:17:48 PM] Miller: at 5% CAGR on 1.2m starting point you would have 17.5m in 55 yrs vs your 4m estimate at 4k bi-weekly
[1/31/18, 2:17:49 PM] Justin: Whatever all other suckers in that state would be payin for your healthcare and food soon enough.
[1/31/18, 2:18:27 PM] Justin: But who is to say you don't invest 50%
[1/31/18, 2:18:42 PM] Miller: 2.5% or so is the breakeven on CAGR to match the 4m
[1/31/18, 2:18:54 PM] Miller: who is to say anything? what if you die in 2 yrs and only get 200k
[1/31/18, 2:19:11 PM] Justin: Fair but if we're assuming 100% investment
[1/31/18, 2:19:20 PM] Justin: Ou can't assume 0% other way
[1/31/18, 2:19:35 PM] Miller: so at 50% its 8.8m,
[1/31/18, 2:19:40 PM] Justin: Presumably that means expenses are paid from elsewhere
[1/31/18, 2:19:55 PM] Miller: theres no reasonable argument to be made for taking the annuity unless its about self control or some sort of addiction issues
[1/31/18, 2:20:01 PM] Justin: You did the math on that?
[1/31/18, 2:20:30 PM] Miller: Two plus two is four
Minus one that's three, quick maths
[1/31/18, 2:20:36 PM] Justin: Ala 50k 52 years 50k 51 years.....
[1/31/18, 2:20:57 PM] Justin: It's factorial
[1/31/18, 2:21:24 PM] Justin: 50k at 52! Plugged into a calc
[1/31/18, 2:21:37 PM] Justin: I doubt you have that app
[1/31/18, 2:21:55 PM] Justin: Actually I take it back. You probably do lol
[1/31/18, 2:23:05 PM] Justin: But I doubt you used that
[1/31/18, 2:24:25 PM] Launchpad: I actually just trimmed some pot profits today...think we're due for a correction
[1/31/18, 2:24:34 PM] Launchpad: don't worry, it was just the shake
[1/31/18, 2:24:37 PM] Miller: was it the jill news?
[1/31/18, 2:24:46 PM] Launchpad: lolol
[1/31/18, 2:24:54 PM] Launchpad: you guys are my contrarian indicators
[1/31/18, 2:25:01 PM] Miller: BTC did correct 50% after my receptionist asked me about it
[1/31/18, 2:25:09 PM] Launchpad: hahaha
[1/31/18, 2:25:38 PM] Launchpad: my coworker said he wanted to buy btc and then after he saw it corrected he didn't want it anymore
[1/31/18, 2:25:52 PM] Launchpad: Buy high sell low I told him üòÇ
[1/31/18, 2:26:07 PM] Justin: I did come in here with that vice article arguing the market is insanely overvalued, but I also learned today that vice is a propaganda machine.
[1/31/18, 2:26:24 PM] Launchpad: lol you just learned that?
[1/31/18, 2:26:32 PM] Launchpad: you know its owned by rupert murdoch
[1/31/18, 2:26:34 PM] Justin: Had no idea. Loved vice.
[1/31/18, 2:26:43 PM] Justin: Well 10%
[1/31/18, 2:27:13 PM] Launchpad: also, Im not getting investment advice from Vice
[1/31/18, 2:27:32 PM] Justin: Why the part theyfet right is drugs
[1/31/18, 2:27:54 PM] Justin: It's just the foreign affairs part that is brutally butchered
[1/31/18, 2:28:20 PM] Justin: Draw in all hipsters by advocating for lsd usage
[1/31/18, 2:49:54 PM] Donk: i dont know if a 5-10% ownership stake by murdoch at vice means that the entire thing is untrustworthy
[1/31/18, 3:13:47 PM] Miller: #BREAKING: San Francisco will retroactively apply California‚Äôs marijuana-legalization laws to past criminal cases, District Attorney George Gasc√≥n said Wednesday.
[1/31/18, 3:14:45 PM] Justin: Nice
[1/31/18, 3:16:03 PM] Justin: And murdochs stake in company isn't what makes vice so propagandized, it's just a pretty relevant point that why would Murdoch invest 100 millions of dollars into building a "left leaning " news organization
[1/31/18, 3:16:44 PM] Justin: Vice hiring a high level obama lifer as COO while obama was in the whitehouse, that's a big part of it.
[1/31/18, 3:17:06 PM] Scott: the programming on vice is dope hto
[1/31/18, 3:17:07 PM] Scott: tho
[1/31/18, 3:17:19 PM] Justin: Yeh they talk about drugs and how cool they are.
[1/31/18, 3:17:56 PM] Justin: Also vice has a pretty gross history. Pretty much started by neo-nazi alt right douche they kicked out in 2011
[1/31/18, 3:20:36 PM] Justin: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/moderate-rebels/id1267540234?mt=2&i=1000400943284
[1/31/18, 3:34:53 PM] Donk: so they kicked that guy out
[1/31/18, 3:35:07 PM] Donk: but yet, i still havent heard you say why its untrustworthy
[1/31/18, 3:38:14 PM] Justin: yssa Mende Mastromonaco (born February 22, 1976)[1] is the President of Global Communications Strategy & Talent at A&E Networks as of December 2016.[2][3] She was previously the Chief Operating Officer of Vice Media.[4] She is also a contributing editor at Marie Claire magazine.[5] She previously served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations in the administration of President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2014.[6][7][8] She was the youngest woman to hold that position.[9] Mastromonaco had worked for Obama since 2005 when he was on the United States Senate as his Director of Scheduling.[10
[1/31/18, 3:38:37 PM] Donk: so anyone who ever worked for obama is untrustworthy?
[1/31/18, 3:38:43 PM] Justin: i know we live in a pretty insane world, but objectivity in the news is literally impossible given this background
[1/31/18, 3:38:52 PM] Donk: and one employee ruins an entire news orginatzion?
[1/31/18, 3:39:11 PM] Justin: how she get the job?
[1/31/18, 3:39:14 PM] Justin: seems strange
[1/31/18, 3:39:34 PM] Justin: guess was just random she left the whitehouse to take over a news organization as 100,s millions was poured into it
[1/31/18, 3:39:50 PM] Justin: im sure it had nothing to do with promoting specific foreign policy
[1/31/18, 3:40:36 PM] Donk: so now you are implying that obama was sending out staffers to go work at news orgs in order to influence them?
[1/31/18, 3:41:01 PM] Justin: the whitehouse was....yes
[1/31/18, 3:41:14 PM] Donk: wow, ok
[1/31/18, 3:41:15 PM] Justin: 20 years ago that would be headlines
[1/31/18, 3:41:54 PM] Donk: my follow up to this is, what news orginzations are trust worthy? and if this is enough to disqualify vice, are you sure what you consider trustworthy is actually trustworthy?
[1/31/18, 3:42:39 PM] Justin: what im saying is that the investment into vice, was done with a specific intended goal, pormoting american foreign policy agenda
[1/31/18, 3:45:30 PM] Justin: if you cant see a massive conflict of interest in a COO being a former high level Obama lifer, than i suppose we are at an impasse
[1/31/18, 3:45:49 PM] Justin: meant to say the COO of a news organization
[1/31/18, 3:46:15 PM] Justin: results aside, that objectively is a massive conflict of interest
[1/31/18, 3:46:21 PM] Donk: i dont
[1/31/18, 3:46:27 PM] Donk: i think people can work a different job after leaving one
[1/31/18, 3:46:31 PM] Donk: you arent put into a box
[1/31/18, 3:46:43 PM] Donk: or a plant/stooge/whatever of tthat person for life
[1/31/18, 3:46:53 PM] Donk: you are basically saying that this woman is nothing more than a mouthpiece
[1/31/18, 3:47:03 PM] Donk: which is rather insulting to this woman
[1/31/18, 3:47:21 PM] Justin: yes, if i worked for obama for 10 years from senate run to whitehouse, im sure id be eager to publish critical articles on his actions in the whitehouse
[1/31/18, 3:47:40 PM] Justin: im sure i wouldnt use that connetion to get exclusives and be gentle on the whitehouse
[1/31/18, 3:47:45 PM] Donk: you act like that doesnt happen
[1/31/18, 3:47:53 PM] Justin: i mean it makes sense id want to be objective and write damaging articles
[1/31/18, 3:48:26 PM] Justin: no im saying we live in a fucked up reality.....30 years ago a conflict of interest like this, as pointed out on the podcast, was headline news
[1/31/18, 3:48:29 PM] Donk: so vice under this woman never said a single negative thing about obama?
[1/31/18, 3:48:45 PM] Justin: thats hyperbole
[1/31/18, 3:48:46 PM] Donk: or any of his policies?
[1/31/18, 3:49:02 PM] Justin: what did i say, i said don't look at the results
[1/31/18, 3:49:10 PM] Justin: answer form an objective viewpoint
[1/31/18, 3:49:30 PM] Donk: im asking you that, you were the one that cliamed that vice was comprimised by this woman
[1/31/18, 3:50:08 PM] Justin: im saying vice glorified libya and is gloryifying syria.
[1/31/18, 3:50:22 PM] Justin: it's not to say much of hte MSM doesnt do the same thing
[1/31/18, 3:51:05 PM] Justin: there is a clear struggle of objetivity built into access and profits
[1/31/18, 3:51:39 PM] Justin: but to higher a former staffer is just blatantly not giving a shit
[1/31/18, 3:52:28 PM] Donk: yeah, i dont agree with your premise here, but thats fine
[1/31/18, 3:52:40 PM] Donk: so what are the trustworthy news orginizations then?
[1/31/18, 3:52:44 PM] Donk: or are there none?
[1/31/18, 3:52:57 PM] Justin: define trustworthy?
[1/31/18, 3:53:17 PM] Donk: no conflicts of interest and tells facts?
[1/31/18, 3:53:19 PM] Justin: this isnt a new phenomenon, is the NYT trustworthy?
[1/31/18, 3:53:32 PM] Donk: i dont know, you were the one calling out vice, im curious who think is legit
[1/31/18, 3:53:52 PM] Miller: TYT obviously
[1/31/18, 3:54:43 PM] Justin: tough to answer that.  Intercept does some strong foreign policy work
[1/31/18, 3:55:07 PM] Justin: tyt isnt really a news organization, i mean tehy dont publish articles
[1/31/18, 3:56:55 PM] Justin: i like the guardian news stories
[1/31/18, 3:57:19 PM] Justin: still like some of vice news stories, but wont bother to look at foreign policy stories
[1/31/18, 3:58:20 PM] Justin: while on this topic the post was a pretty good movie

[2/1/18, 9:40:45 AM] Launchpad: Lowe's To Give Hourly Employees Bonus Of Up To $1,000 -- Market Talk
Today 9:35 AM ET (Dow Jones)Print

09:35 ET - Lowe's plans to give hourly employees a one-time bonus of up to $1,000. The home improvement retailer isn't sharing how little an employee could receive under the one-time bonus offer or how many employees will receive the maximum $1,000 bonus, said a spokeswoman. Lowe's has around 260,000 hourly employees. As part of the bonus announcement Lowe's said new tax legislation would result in an additional net tax expense of around $75M in 4Q of fiscal 2017, which along with the one-time bonus, will likely reduce 4Q EPS by $0.14. Tax reform will be positive on profits during fiscal year 2018, said the company. Lowe's will give fiscal 2018 guidance during its 4Q earnings call on Feb. 28th, it said.

[2/2/18, 2:16:38 PM] Justin: I would have done subtitles. Joia couldnt pay attention though. Yes dubbing is beyond bad. It's the room bad
[2/2/18, 2:17:10 PM] Justin: And show still makes up for it. Presumably if you like subtitle I'm gonna guess that's a better route to go.

[2/2/18, 4:48:35 PM] Launchpad: what about my company? It was bootstrapped in 2010 with the founders own money. We now have about 65 people working here
[2/2/18, 4:49:08 PM] Justin: did that not happen in generations past?
[2/2/18, 4:49:19 PM] Launchpad: of course it did
[2/2/18, 4:51:08 PM] Justin: clearly the conversation is much more complicated
[2/2/18, 4:56:13 PM] Brian Katz: Nah it‚Äôs more complicated than that
[2/2/18, 4:56:51 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 4:57:15 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[2/2/18, 4:57:51 PM] Launchpad: All I know is that macro opinions are basically meaningless when you don't have skin in the game
[2/2/18, 4:58:34 PM] Justin: all i know is monkeys trade as well as hedge funds
[2/2/18, 4:59:06 PM] Miller: I mean that's just not true
[2/2/18, 4:59:07 PM] Justin: no offense to milker
[2/2/18, 4:59:09 PM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 4:59:47 PM] Brian Katz: So offense to Miller?
[2/2/18, 5:00:21 PM] Miller: No doubt monkeys throwing darts is going to outperform a long short equity hedge fund in a bull market, thinking that means anything is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how hedge funds work or the purpose they serve
[2/2/18, 5:00:28 PM] Launchpad: He's saying you milk the markets like baby goat
[2/2/18, 5:00:34 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 5:01:22 PM] Brian Katz: What the hell did you search for that? Lol
[2/2/18, 5:01:34 PM] Launchpad: it was the default option lol
[2/2/18, 5:02:06 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 5:02:07 PM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 5:03:24 PM] Justin: i thought the market only goes up?
[2/2/18, 5:03:47 PM] Miller: Did I ever say that?
[2/2/18, 5:04:07 PM] Justin: smeone else said corrections are expected, things need to cool off
[2/2/18, 5:04:12 PM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 5:04:40 PM] Launchpad: who the fuck said that
[2/2/18, 5:05:48 PM] Justin: .
[2/2/18, 5:06:34 PM] Launchpad: so whats your point again?
[2/2/18, 5:07:17 PM] Justin: its pretty simple, millers claiming hedge funds manage risk....which implies there is risk...which implies markets can do more than cool down
[2/2/18, 5:07:42 PM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 5:08:23 PM] Launchpad: sometimes markets melt down
[2/2/18, 5:08:43 PM] Launchpad: and sometimes 10 years into a bull market people keep complaining how much markets suck
[2/2/18, 5:08:43 PM] Justin: and does it matter why they melt down or up?
[2/2/18, 5:10:00 PM] Justin: well i complain about how much markets suck for that exact reason
[2/2/18, 5:10:59 PM] Brian Katz: I think it‚Äôd be cool if Herman and Scotty freaky fridayed each other.
[2/2/18, 5:11:17 PM] Justin: markets create perverse incentives on the distribution of profits and wealth from long term sustainability and  increased wages to shortsighted profit and market runups
[2/2/18, 5:11:21 PM] Launchpad: Ive been waiting the last 11 years to not have a job, sign me up
[2/2/18, 5:11:34 PM] Launchpad: Actually they fucken dont
[2/2/18, 5:12:20 PM] Launchpad: if you think you're not getting paid enough, theres only one person to blame
[2/2/18, 5:13:01 PM] Launchpad: you don't get to have a satisfying fulfilling life because you put your name on the signup sheet
[2/2/18, 5:13:29 PM] Launchpad: No one owes you a living wage
[2/2/18, 5:15:13 PM] Justin: literally your life is a function of working enough and building up enough wealth to get the oppurtunity to retire.   Everything is commodified, productivity no longer tracks with wage increases, and debt peonage in ingraned into the system in the form of student loans
[2/2/18, 5:16:23 PM] Justin: it wasnt bad enough that your productivity and wages started diverging in the late 70's, the insitutional system now puts everyone into debt and steals the future value of their labor through student loans
[2/2/18, 5:16:41 PM] Launchpad: congrats
[2/2/18, 5:16:46 PM] Justin: im not saying there is an answer
[2/2/18, 5:17:33 PM] Justin: but living your life to be able to comfortably retire seems like a rather contradictory existence , specifically when many people wont even be able to do that
[2/2/18, 5:17:52 PM] Launchpad: you have access to the cumulative knowledge base of all the worlds information at your finger tips....if you can't figure out how to use that to provide for yourself, I don't know what to tell you
[2/2/18, 5:18:11 PM] Launchpad: they make that choice
[2/2/18, 5:18:19 PM] Launchpad: its a choice
[2/2/18, 5:18:38 PM] Launchpad: if you're not putting away money for your future its your own damn fault
[2/2/18, 5:19:13 PM] Justin: as is grinding away for 35 years to be able to retire at 55.  I'm sure plenty of people save for retirement and retire comfortably and absolutely hated their jobs
[2/2/18, 5:19:39 PM] Justin: its just a really fucked up system when you think about it....I'm not saying i have a better answer
[2/2/18, 5:19:54 PM] Justin: but that answer gonna ahve to come soon with the rapid rate of AI imporvement
[2/2/18, 5:20:20 PM] Launchpad: so basically you're complaining that is hard
[2/2/18, 5:20:46 PM] Launchpad: Maybe JP Morgan Chase should send someone over to your house to wipe your ass, because they have so much money
[2/2/18, 5:21:05 PM] Launchpad: they have more then they will ever need but you still don't have anyone wiping your ass
[2/2/18, 5:21:33 PM] Launchpad: grave injustice if you ask me
[2/2/18, 5:21:37 PM] Justin: i dont think your brain is wired to udnerstand what im saying
[2/2/18, 5:21:42 PM] Justin: its not about easy hard
[2/2/18, 5:22:03 PM] Justin: its about an existential question, what is the point of life
[2/2/18, 5:22:18 PM] Launchpad: the world was a lot better when we used to just be able to kill people we didn't like and take their resources
[2/2/18, 5:22:29 PM] Justin: which we arent doing now?
[2/2/18, 5:22:40 PM] Justin: and who was it better for?
[2/2/18, 5:23:59 PM] Justin: but thats a whole other philosophical debate.  Are we inherently selfish.  We probably are, which is why capitlaism has worked so "well"
[2/2/18, 5:25:04 PM] Scott: So true
[2/2/18, 5:25:33 PM] Launchpad: so should I or should I not put away money for my retirement or should I just kill myself because life is meaningless and so is my existence
[2/2/18, 5:25:41 PM] Justin: lol
[2/2/18, 5:26:01 PM] Justin: hey im not getting trapped and ogign to prison for cyber bullying you into suicide after weed stocks fall another 80%
[2/2/18, 5:26:43 PM] Brian Katz: Everyday is unique. We get to do whatever we choose to do. So treat each day as a gift.
[2/2/18, 5:27:23 PM] Justin: thats fair, but wnot true
[2/2/18, 5:27:35 PM] Justin: there are plenty of things we cant do because we dont have the resources to do them
[2/2/18, 5:27:46 PM] Justin: which means we need to work to get the resources
[2/2/18, 5:27:54 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/2/18, 5:27:59 PM] Justin: which means we arent choosing to do whatever we want, we are forced to work for it
[2/2/18, 5:28:19 PM] Brian Katz: Sometimes the path to your goals is longer than others, but nothing is impossible to accomplish.
[2/2/18, 5:28:22 PM] Justin: im not providing a better answer
[2/2/18, 5:29:13 PM] Launchpad: I have the resources to do most things I feel like but I budget responsibly
[2/2/18, 5:29:15 PM] Brian Katz: If you want to do nothing you can. I see bums on my way to work everyday. They made their choice to do nothing.
[2/2/18, 5:29:43 PM] Justin: ok, what if you wnated to make art?  or write poems all day?
[2/2/18, 5:29:54 PM] Justin: or make music?
[2/2/18, 5:30:04 PM] Justin: what if you wnted to spend your life with a loved one?
[2/2/18, 5:30:15 PM] Launchpad: thats fucken great, but if there is no one who wants to consume your content, it offers no value to the world
[2/2/18, 5:30:19 PM] Justin: can you freely do these things?
[2/2/18, 5:30:25 PM] Brian Katz: You can go and try for that. Look at jewel or jk Rawlings
[2/2/18, 5:30:28 PM] Launchpad: yes I can
[2/2/18, 5:30:30 PM] Justin: ahh, commodification
[2/2/18, 5:30:44 PM] Justin: everything is commodified
[2/2/18, 5:30:50 PM] Justin: if it cant be sold--- its worthless
[2/2/18, 5:31:01 PM] Launchpad: why should I give you my food I earned at the job I get paid at when all you want to do is write shitty poetry that no one gives a fuck about
[2/2/18, 5:31:15 PM] Launchpad: yes your shitty poetry is worthless
[2/2/18, 5:31:15 PM] Justin: im not saying you should
[2/2/18, 5:31:29 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty give up your food
[2/2/18, 5:31:36 PM] Justin: im not providing an answer, just a check on the system that is
[2/2/18, 5:31:54 PM] Launchpad: Im being dead honest right now
[2/2/18, 5:31:55 PM] Justin: perhaps it is the best system, that doesnt take a way from the critique
[2/2/18, 5:32:05 PM] Launchpad: you should create a blog on steemit
[2/2/18, 5:32:06 PM] Launchpad: https://steemit.com/
[2/2/18, 5:32:25 PM] Launchpad: so we can commodify your writing and put a $ amount on it
[2/2/18, 5:32:30 PM] Justin: lol
[2/2/18, 5:32:57 PM] Justin: at least thats decentralized captialism
[2/2/18, 5:33:30 PM] Launchpad: I would think that you should love steemit
[2/2/18, 5:33:41 PM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/2/18, 5:34:32 PM] Justin: capitalism is brilliant, you cant argue with its effectiveness and appeal
[2/2/18, 5:34:49 PM] Justin: also much better than feudalism
[2/2/18, 5:35:51 PM] Justin: anyway all this nonsensical babel has distracted me, im out
[2/2/18, 5:36:13 PM] Brian Katz: Back to Herman‚Äôs saw gym
[2/2/18, 5:36:18 PM] Launchpad: lol

[2/2/18, 5:57:46 PM] Launchpad: this is a real response to someone I know looking for a room to rent with his GF
[2/2/18, 6:03:43 PM] Miller: You should take him up
[2/2/18, 6:03:56 PM] Miller: 1700 bucks a month tax free
[2/2/18, 10:53:35 PM] Justin: @justinherman http://thehill.com/policy/finance/371800-hostess-snack-company-gives-employees-1250-year-of-snacks-after-gop-tax-cuts#.WnPeYvceaUo.facebook
[2/2/18, 10:53:46 PM] Justin: Figured I'd post these for you from now on.

[2/3/18, 1:23:09 PM] Miller: Btw my barber today asked me about bitcoin
[2/3/18, 1:27:58 PM] Brian Katz: Did you tell him I‚Äôll have a number two, fade the back, and don‚Äôt buy bitcoin.
[2/3/18, 1:29:18 PM] Miller: üòÇ
[2/3/18, 2:03:49 PM] Justin: That Paul Ryan thing can't be real
[2/3/18, 2:04:11 PM] Justin: Lol no check. Nm
[2/3/18, 2:04:16 PM] Justin: Sadly kinda believed it
[2/3/18, 2:04:31 PM] Brian Katz: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[2/3/18, 2:04:35 PM] Brian Katz: This happened
[2/3/18, 2:06:13 PM] Launchpad: youre a weird dude
[2/3/18, 2:06:39 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm in a bachelor party chat for Lippy and it turned dark
[2/3/18, 2:20:38 PM] Miller: It's real, that's just how my app displays it, I checked
[2/3/18, 2:21:45 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/3/18, 4:08:50 PM] Justin: when he goes from head of the party to losingto a progressive that somehow won the primary bc democrats didn't want to run anyone against him, I'm sure democrats will still downplay it
[2/3/18, 4:09:16 PM] Justin: "Didn't want to run anyone against Ryan "

[2/4/18, 12:13:35 PM] Miller: Baby steps
[2/4/18, 12:13:32 PM] Miller: You don't even have a football team
[2/4/18, 12:15:47 PM] Launchpad: no shit
[2/4/18, 12:16:35 PM] Launchpad: all we needed was a new stadium and we'd have a football team and host the super bowl every 10 years, but the spanos are idiots, the citys a bunch of idiots and finally the voters are idiots
[2/4/18, 6:30:09 PM] Launchpad: Whos down money already
[2/4/18, 6:36:34 PM] Miller: I always bet the under on the anthem but didn't make any bets this year, so I'm down by virtue of not winning money
[2/4/18, 7:41:05 PM] Justin: Scared money
[2/4/18, 7:52:52 PM] Miller: Of course the one year I don't get 5 2
[2/4/18, 8:02:47 PM] Launchpad: Wont need it
[2/4/18, 8:03:18 PM] Miller: You're that confident philly scoring?
[2/4/18, 8:03:33 PM] Miller: Fair enough
[2/4/18, 8:03:36 PM] Justin: hahaha\
[2/4/18, 8:03:44 PM] Launchpad: Nope lol
[2/4/18, 8:03:52 PM] Miller: Just like launchpad drew it up
[2/4/18, 8:03:56 PM] Launchpad: Not with them going for it
[2/4/18, 8:04:29 PM] Justin: thats insane call
[2/4/18, 8:04:47 PM] Miller: Seriously
[2/4/18, 8:05:45 PM] Miller: That's the classic if this doesn't work everyone calls you a fucking idiot
[2/4/18, 8:07:56 PM] Justin: chance first time ever 2-2 wins a box
[2/4/18, 8:08:19 PM] Miller: All my usual awful numbers are in play
[2/4/18, 8:09:43 PM] Miller: Hilarious that this might come down to which QB can catch (though I maintain that Amendola pass was a little off target)
[2/4/18, 8:11:09 PM] Miller: Now it's time for typical Patriots 2nd half defensive adjustment
[2/4/18, 8:12:52 PM] Justin: i agree
[2/4/18, 8:12:56 PM] Justin: overthrown
[2/4/18, 8:13:25 PM] Justin: no penalties calle din 1st half... cant wait for the refs to start gifting pats the comeback
[2/4/18, 8:13:39 PM] Justin: gues they did have 3rd down holding call
[2/4/18, 8:14:20 PM] Miller: These blue dot auto insurance ads are fucking annoying
[2/4/18, 8:14:23 PM] Miller: Too smug
[2/4/18, 8:14:45 PM] Justin: idk i like it
[2/4/18, 8:20:55 PM] Justin: should played weekend song instead this crap
[2/4/18, 8:24:59 PM] Launchpad: I called these guys the backstreet boys and got dirty looks from all the girls in the room
[2/4/18, 9:01:57 PM] Miller: Nobody in the history of music has more songs in commercials than kanye
[2/4/18, 9:17:31 PM] Miller: @mikezoller: Man, all these Tide commercials are making me hungry.
[2/4/18, 9:21:26 PM] Dan Watts: These tide commercials have to be a Response to the pod controversy no?
[2/4/18, 9:21:38 PM] Miller: Absolutely
[2/4/18, 9:22:38 PM] Miller: Try to make it so when people think tide they think witty superbowl commercials not eating laundry detergent
[2/4/18, 9:22:47 PM] Donk: Eli and odell ftw
[2/4/18, 9:24:00 PM] Dan Watts: Not sure the most effective way
[2/4/18, 9:24:05 PM] Launchpad: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2/4/18, 9:36:30 PM] Miller: I thought the halftime show was terrible
[2/4/18, 9:50:43 PM] Scott: Agreed.
[2/4/18, 9:51:47 PM] Miller: Gtfo here with this hyundai commercial
[2/4/18, 9:51:58 PM] Miller: Hey you're trying to get into the superbowl

[2/4/18, 9:55:16 PM] James  L: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/4/18, 9:55:51 PM] Miller: This feels like an eagles turnover coming
[2/4/18, 9:56:27 PM] Miller: Lmao they're gonna call that a touch back
[2/4/18, 9:58:30 PM] Justin: that bette rbe a fcken catch
[2/4/18, 9:58:31 PM] Miller: In all seriousness he's a runner and all he needs to do is break the plane, that's stupid
[2/4/18, 9:58:45 PM] Justin: but its not turnover
[2/4/18, 9:58:48 PM] Justin: he got ti back anyway right
[2/4/18, 9:59:41 PM] Miller: it would be a turnover if he fumbled it into the end zone
[2/4/18, 9:59:56 PM] Launchpad: TD
[2/4/18, 9:59:58 PM] Justin: not if it doesnt go out of bounds
[2/4/18, 10:00:04 PM] Miller: True good point
[2/4/18, 10:00:50 PM] Miller: Oh man I actually have 8 3
[2/4/18, 10:00:55 PM] Miller: Cmon no more scores
[2/4/18, 10:01:44 PM] Miller: Obviously no chance of them stopping Brady
[2/4/18, 10:03:13 PM] Justin: wowow
[2/4/18, 10:03:24 PM] Justin: guess you need first down
[2/4/18, 10:03:27 PM] Miller: Lol now I'm fucked still
[2/4/18, 10:04:20 PM] Justin: sick thing is fg only puts em up 8
[2/4/18, 10:05:06 PM] Miller: Hopefully Pedersen grabs his nuts one final time and goes for it
[2/4/18, 10:05:24 PM] Justin: or one first down
[2/4/18, 10:09:01 PM] Miller: Lame
[2/4/18, 10:21:37 PM] Justin: nfc east eats against the patriots
[2/4/18, 10:21:54 PM] Miller: Well kept my 15 year not winning any boxes streak alive and the Patriots lost and the eagles won
[2/4/18, 10:22:07 PM] Miller: But it was a hell of an entertaining game
[2/4/18, 10:28:12 PM] Justin: damn netflix
[2/4/18, 10:28:14 PM] Justin: making moves
[2/4/18, 10:28:27 PM] Miller: Yea that's crazy

[2/5/18, 5:32:50 PM] Launchpad: tbh I kind of like watching them lick the cheese of their fingers ü§§
[2/5/18, 5:32:58 PM] Miller: really dont think the reason skinny women are not eating doritos has anything to do w/the crunching
[2/5/18, 5:33:41 PM] Miller: ive seen many bags of doritos demolished by drunken women
[2/5/18, 5:33:47 PM] Sean: I feel like a chip with no crunch isn‚Äôt a chip
[2/5/18, 5:33:54 PM] Sean: Facts
[2/5/18, 5:33:59 PM] Brian Katz: So will the chips be soggy? How will they not crunch? Who cares if they do? And why would women prefer this?
[2/5/18, 5:34:32 PM] Sean: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2/5/18, 5:35:05 PM] Brian Katz: Maybe they should try clear Doritos
[2/5/18, 5:35:26 PM] Sean: There actually is a clear Japanese potato chip
[2/5/18, 5:35:37 PM] Brian Katz: Lol no way
[2/5/18, 5:35:47 PM] Launchpad: lol
[2/5/18, 5:35:47 PM] Sean: They boil the potatoes and use the water mixed with starch and bake them to create a clear chip
[2/5/18, 5:36:14 PM] Brian Katz: Is that super low in calories or something?
[2/5/18, 5:36:30 PM] Sean: I‚Äôm assuming no, but maybe
[2/5/18, 5:36:40 PM] Launchpad: who cares you can wear it like a monocle

[2/5/18, 7:32:07 PM] Miller: @16316620763 I watched the first episode of German kids getting smacked in the head, meh
[2/5/18, 7:32:12 PM] Miller: The dubbing is awful
[2/5/18, 7:42:10 PM] Justin: the dubbing is beyond bad
[2/5/18, 7:42:31 PM] Justin: but show gets super interesting
[2/5/18, 7:42:36 PM] Justin: @lawyers At the top end, what‚Äôs happening to lawyers is a model for any occupation involving analysis, subtle interpretation, strategizing, and persuasion. The computer incursion into the legal-discovery process is well known. In cases around the country, computers are reading millions of documents and sorting them for relevance without getting tired or distracted. But that‚Äôs just the beginning. Computers are also becoming highly skilled at searching the legal literature for appropriate precedents in a given case, far more widely and thoroughly than people can do. Humans still have to identify the legal issues involved, but as Northwestern University law professor John O. McGinnis points out in a recent article, ‚ÄúSearch engines will eventually do this by themselves, and then go on to suggest the case law that is likely to prove relevant to the matter.‚Äù

Advancing even deeper into the territory of lawyerly skill, computers can already predict Supreme Court decisions better than lawyers can. As such analytical power expands in scope, computers will move nearer to the heart of what lawyers do by advising better than lawyers can on whether to sue or settle or go to trial before any court and in any type of case. Companies such as Lex Machina and Huron Legal already offer such analytical services, which are improving by the day.
[2/5/18, 7:43:47 PM] Justin: None of this means that lawyers will disappear, but it suggests that the world will need fewer of them. It‚Äôs already happening. ‚ÄúThe rise of machine intelligence is probably partly to blame for the current crisis of law schools‚Äù ‚Äî shrinking enrollments, falling tuitions ‚Äî ‚Äúand will certainly worsen that crisis,‚Äù says McGinnis. With infotech thoroughly disrupting even a field so advanced that it requires three years of graduate education and can pay extremely well, other high-skill workers ‚Äî analysts, managers ‚Äî can‚Äôt help wondering about their own futures.
[2/5/18, 7:45:37 PM] Launchpad: lets be honest here, the world has ALWAYS needed fewer lawyers @16102201963 @17189742074

[2/5/18, 7:49:20 PM] Justin: damn guy admists swag is where tis at
[2/5/18, 7:49:21 PM] Justin: The answer is becoming clear. Think about lawyers again. Average lawyers ‚Äúface a bleak future,‚Äù in McGinnis‚Äôs view. Their best chance of making a living may be ‚Äúby persuading angry and irrational clients to act in their self-interest,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMachines won‚Äôt be able to create the necessary emotional bonds to perform this important service.‚Äù In addition, a few ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù will do well by using technology to cut their costs (they won‚Äôt need many associates) and to turbocharge their ‚Äúuniquely human judgment‚Äù in highly complex cases.

[2/7/18, 4:51:13 PM] Launchpad: President Donald Trump said Wednesday the stock market's negative reaction to good news about the economy is a "big mistake," as stocks closed lower following a multiday bout of volatility.
[2/7/18, 4:52:21 PM] Launchpad: Trump had meetings scheduled Wednesday with Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, as well as Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee.

A White House official told MarketWatch Trump would get "an update on the CFTC's agenda" at his first official meeting with Giancarlo, and that the meeting had been in the works for a while. Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton testified on virtual currencies like bitcoin at a Senate hearing on Tuesday.
[2/7/18, 4:52:59 PM] Launchpad: You think my boy Giancarlo is instructing Trump to HODL??
[2/7/18, 4:56:54 PM] Launchpad: or maybe hes advising Trump to keep his off the book money in Monero?

[2/8/18, 10:38:03 AM] Launchpad: Good news -- 3 of the 19 known richest people in crypto are working on EOS
[2/8/18, 10:39:28 AM] Kiyoon: Or bad news, 16 of the 19 known richest people in crypto are not working on EOS
[2/8/18, 10:39:43 AM] Launchpad: If this bothers you, become an entrepreneur make as much money as possible, then give it all away
[2/8/18, 10:40:22 AM] Justin: woudlnt solve the problem, those people want to be poor
[2/8/18, 10:40:46 AM] Launchpad: and you don't want to want to help
[2/8/18, 10:41:34 AM] Donk: launchpad doesnt see poor people. he only sees people who have yet to grab their dicks and invest in crypto
[2/8/18, 10:42:16 AM] Launchpad: I see people complaining that poverty exists, and those people don't want to do anything about it
[2/8/18, 10:42:33 AM] Dan Watts: https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-02-06-loot-to-eat-the-new-mantra-of-venezuela-as-socialism-collapse-leads-to-mass-starvation.html
[2/8/18, 10:42:39 AM] Dan Watts: Communism only solution
[2/8/18, 10:42:47 AM] Launchpad: lol
[2/8/18, 10:43:16 AM] Donk: lol, communisim isnt why venuzela is poor right now
[2/8/18, 10:43:52 AM] Launchpad: why is Venezuela poor then?
[2/8/18, 10:43:59 AM] Donk: the oil crash
[2/8/18, 10:44:18 AM] Donk: they were far too invested in the prices in oil
[2/8/18, 10:44:33 AM] Launchpad: who the individual communist investors?
[2/8/18, 10:44:40 AM] Justin: yeh us sanctions have nothing to do with it
[2/8/18, 10:44:45 AM] Launchpad: did they all own Exxon Mobile & Chevron in their Etrade accounts?
[2/8/18, 10:45:02 AM] Justin: i mean why would a country have a difficult time trading for food when the US doesnt allow them to trade
[2/8/18, 10:45:13 AM] Donk: i didnt mean actual investments launchpad lol
[2/8/18, 10:45:23 AM] Donk: i mean the economy as a whole rlied on oil exports
[2/8/18, 10:45:48 AM] Justin: Maduro isnt chavez either
[2/8/18, 10:46:23 AM] Dan Watts: Communism is 95% the reason Venezuela is the way it is
[2/8/18, 10:46:36 AM] Justin: Really?
[2/8/18, 10:46:38 AM] Donk: wrong
[2/8/18, 10:46:39 AM] Donk: but ok
[2/8/18, 10:46:44 AM] Justin: so hows rest of latin america doing with cpaitalism?
[2/8/18, 10:46:57 AM] Launchpad: who do you think made the country so reliable on oil?
[2/8/18, 10:47:01 AM] Launchpad: the dirt farmers?
[2/8/18, 10:47:11 AM] Justin: last i saw some asshole was yelling on tv about how they were all fleeing through mexico into US
[2/8/18, 10:47:23 AM] Dan Watts: It's absolute hell there
[2/8/18, 10:47:32 AM] Justin: and what roll do sanctions play in that?
[2/8/18, 10:48:16 AM] Dan Watts: In the same way the Soviet Union was hell and Maoist China
[2/8/18, 10:48:19 AM] Justin: its like pouring gasoline all over a house and lighting the match then walking away and saying that shits burning
[2/8/18, 10:48:45 AM] Brian Katz: That would be a true statement
[2/8/18, 10:49:28 AM] Justin: I mean veneuzuela is in terirble shape right now
[2/8/18, 10:49:32 AM] Dan Watts: Communism has led to some of the worst outcomes in human history. More people died under soviet rule than the holocaust and it's still seen as some kind of ideal. Sick!
[2/8/18, 10:49:35 AM] Justin: what about libya?
[2/8/18, 10:49:37 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/18, 10:49:49 AM] Justin: hows capitalism Obama brought going there ?
[2/8/18, 10:50:04 AM] Justin: so china is a shithole?
[2/8/18, 10:50:16 AM] Justin: its gonna surpass the US very soon
[2/8/18, 10:50:44 AM] Justin: that snot to say China doesnt have issues, tehy have plenty of human right sissues
[2/8/18, 10:50:45 AM] Donk: the Soviet union was not communism
[2/8/18, 10:51:23 AM] Justin: yeh i mean its arbitray distinction to say what is and isnt communism/socilaism
[2/8/18, 10:51:42 AM] Donk: under no measure what is it really either - it was a dictatorship by committee instead
[2/8/18, 10:51:52 AM] Justin: but i can agree w watz that these places claim to be commmunist therefore they are
[2/8/18, 10:52:23 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/18, 10:52:41 AM] Justin: he means in theory
[2/8/18, 10:52:48 AM] Justin: kinda like somalia isnt a pure market eocnomy
[2/8/18, 10:52:50 AM] Donk: and the nazis called themselves democratic socialists
[2/8/18, 10:52:54 AM] Justin: even thoguh tehre is no government
[2/8/18, 10:53:37 AM] Justin: i think in the case of russia though....its fair to say its communist
[2/8/18, 10:54:05 AM] Donk: i dont
[2/8/18, 10:54:15 AM] Justin: but the word is very interesting in general
[2/8/18, 10:54:20 AM] Launchpad: so what you're saying is you hate corruption
[2/8/18, 10:54:27 AM] Launchpad: corruption and capitalism
[2/8/18, 10:54:28 AM] Justin: it actually has a very anti semtiic undertone to it as well
[2/8/18, 10:54:35 AM] Launchpad: but capitalism is especially the devil
[2/8/18, 10:54:49 AM] Launchpad: so does anti-capitalism
[2/8/18, 10:54:55 AM] Dan Watts: Cuba- where it's so great everyone wants to leave
[2/8/18, 10:54:57 AM] Justin: the great russian communists were mostly jews
[2/8/18, 10:55:08 AM] Justin: ok and mexico?
[2/8/18, 10:55:13 AM] Justin: why people leaving mexico?
[2/8/18, 10:55:22 AM] Launchpad: oh they're not communist - they just took the label
[2/8/18, 10:55:43 AM] Justin: you cant possibly think this reductively simply because the word communist agitates you
[2/8/18, 10:56:03 AM] Justin: cuba's doctors are some of the best in the world
[2/8/18, 10:56:11 AM] Launchpad: and this reducttively simple word capitalism agitates you
[2/8/18, 10:56:22 AM] Justin: now i know someone gonna send me some article where most cubans dont get access ot that healthcare........
[2/8/18, 10:56:36 AM] Justin: no it doesn't
[2/8/18, 10:57:03 AM] Justin: what is capitalism?
[2/8/18, 10:57:07 AM] Justin: is the fed capitalism?
[2/8/18, 10:57:17 AM] Justin: are roads capitalism?
[2/8/18, 10:57:45 AM] Justin: you cant characterize things simply by what you like
[2/8/18, 10:57:51 AM] Launchpad: when was the last time you went out of your way to help a poor person?
[2/8/18, 10:58:21 AM] Justin: never have
[2/8/18, 10:59:18 AM] Launchpad: Id believe it
[2/8/18, 10:59:36 AM] Launchpad: You only want other people to do things
[2/8/18, 10:59:55 AM] Justin: yes thanks for that box
[2/8/18, 11:00:07 AM] Launchpad: I might be impressed if instead of complaining you actually went to a soup kitchen and served some food
[2/8/18, 11:00:40 AM] Justin: wtf does this have to do with venezuela?
[2/8/18, 11:00:52 AM] Justin: or comunism
[2/8/18, 11:00:59 AM] Justin: please elaborate your brilliant line of thinking
[2/8/18, 11:01:08 AM] Launchpad: venezuala is a shit place with a shit government
[2/8/18, 11:01:19 AM] Justin: america is  aa shit place witha  shit government?
[2/8/18, 11:01:24 AM] Justin: wtf does that matter?
[2/8/18, 11:01:33 AM] Launchpad: I wouldn't say its a shit place
[2/8/18, 11:01:43 AM] Launchpad: San Diego is beautiful
[2/8/18, 11:01:58 AM] Justin: ok im sure areas of veneuzela ar ebeautfil, once agian wtf is you rpoint?
[2/8/18, 11:02:10 AM] Launchpad: the govt is not perfect but they are better than the venezualan and cuban governments
[2/8/18, 11:02:18 AM] Justin: why?
[2/8/18, 11:02:23 AM] Justin: because you say so
[2/8/18, 11:02:41 AM] Launchpad: my point is your complaining doesn't do anything about the condition
[2/8/18, 11:02:48 AM] Justin: im not complaining
[2/8/18, 11:02:48 AM] Launchpad: Daniel Larimer is doing more to help the poor than you
[2/8/18, 11:03:00 AM] Justin: i didnt start this conversation by saying communism= hell
[2/8/18, 11:03:03 AM] Justin: i said thats not true
[2/8/18, 11:03:07 AM] Launchpad: but hes just a rich evil capitalist
[2/8/18, 11:03:10 AM] Justin: and now somehow im the "hater"
[2/8/18, 11:03:45 AM] Justin: im advocating for perspective on things
[2/8/18, 11:04:09 AM] Launchpad: not actually helping, just perspective
[2/8/18, 11:04:55 AM] Justin: let sfollow the logic in your argument.  Everythign i say means nothing because i dont volunteeer a ta soup kitchen?
[2/8/18, 11:05:13 AM] Launchpad: its just pointless
[2/8/18, 11:05:14 AM] Justin: by that standard, have you made enoguh off crypto to retire?
[2/8/18, 11:05:23 AM] Justin: then why the fuck do i ahve to listen to you tlak about it
[2/8/18, 11:05:24 AM] Launchpad: not yet
[2/8/18, 11:05:33 AM] Justin: you clearly arent an expert if you arent a millionaire by now
[2/8/18, 11:05:40 AM] Justin: i mean its appreciated over 5k pecent

[2/8/18, 11:06:15 AM] Justin: or your all tlak
[2/8/18, 11:06:22 AM] Launchpad: lol
[2/8/18, 11:06:24 AM] Launchpad: ok buddy
[2/8/18, 11:06:25 AM] Justin: becuase alot of talk and no retirement
[2/8/18, 11:06:30 AM] Justin: so.....
[2/8/18, 11:06:39 AM] Launchpad: you wanna be a broke ass all your life fine
[2/8/18, 11:06:45 AM] Launchpad: broke and complaining
[2/8/18, 11:06:53 AM] Launchpad: ignoring every opportunity in front of you
[2/8/18, 11:07:07 AM] Justin: so like i said
[2/8/18, 11:07:09 AM] Launchpad: socialism will save us
[2/8/18, 11:07:15 AM] Launchpad: communism aint that bad
[2/8/18, 11:07:18 AM] Launchpad: capitalism sucks
[2/8/18, 11:07:19 AM] Justin: you arent rich off crypto, let some rich guy tell me about crpyto
[2/8/18, 11:07:23 AM] Launchpad: someone else solve all the problems!!!
[2/8/18, 11:07:51 AM] Justin: not at all what im saying
[2/8/18, 11:07:52 AM] Launchpad: I've still made more money off crypto than 99% of the planet
[2/8/18, 11:07:58 AM] Justin: what ims aying is there is no such thing as cpaitlaism or slcialism
[2/8/18, 11:08:07 AM] Justin: we lives in social democracies
[2/8/18, 11:08:25 AM] Justin: where the state acts of socialism are considered capitalist
[2/8/18, 11:08:51 AM] Launchpad: fine we're a socialist country
[2/8/18, 11:08:55 AM] Justin: depending on where you are.... so in europe healthcare isn't considered socialist....here it would be
[2/8/18, 11:09:00 AM] Launchpad: you win you can have your label
[2/8/18, 11:09:08 AM] Justin: so its simply a blurreled line of perspective
[2/8/18, 11:09:34 AM] Launchpad: Look what Socialism has done to this country
[2/8/18, 11:09:58 AM] Justin: https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/the-end-of-welfare-as-we-know-it/476322/
[2/8/18, 11:10:51 AM] Justin: like i said perspective.  Clinton ended welfare
[2/8/18, 11:12:00 AM] Launchpad: you know what else was really successful? TARP
[2/8/18, 11:12:10 AM] Justin: the causes of things can be analyzed.  Hence we can look at why people ar epoor in america, and in venezuela
[2/8/18, 11:12:40 AM] Brian Katz: Did you guys realize that street fighter 2 came out 27 years ago? Wow
[2/8/18, 11:12:58 AM] Justin: fair transition
[2/8/18, 11:13:01 AM] Launchpad: lol @16318489683
[2/8/18, 11:13:03 AM] Justin: im done anyway
[2/8/18, 11:13:22 AM] Launchpad: I know why I am not poor and thats enough for me
[2/8/18, 11:13:32 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs game was about world powers battling for supremacy
[2/8/18, 11:13:38 AM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/8/18, 11:13:39 AM] Launchpad: lol true
[2/8/18, 11:13:58 AM] Justin: all those back alley HJ's
[2/8/18, 11:14:01 AM] Brian Katz: What did you type in for that? Lol
[2/8/18, 11:14:06 AM] Justin: dicks
[2/8/18, 11:14:48 AM] Launchpad: no because I save and invest - the same formula thats worked for thousands of years
[2/8/18, 11:14:58 AM] Justin: thousands of years....yes
[2/8/18, 11:15:00 AM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/8/18, 11:15:05 AM] Justin: mcuh better
[2/8/18, 11:15:12 AM] Justin: should looked for dicks in mouth maybe

[2/8/18, 11:15:34 AM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/8/18, 11:16:07 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/18, 11:16:21 AM] Launchpad: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/8/18, 11:17:12 AM] Justin: let me point you to usury laws
[2/8/18, 11:17:35 AM] Justin: Exodus 22:24 (25)‚ÄîIf thou lend money to any of My people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest. Leviticus 25:36‚Äî Take thou no interest of him or increase; but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
[2/8/18, 11:18:09 AM] Justin: so stock market equals a no no
[2/8/18, 11:18:16 AM] Launchpad: good thing us jews don't have that law
[2/8/18, 11:18:28 AM] Justin: wasnt a good thing for all the dead ones
[2/8/18, 11:18:29 AM] Launchpad: that doesn't say anything about a stock market
[2/8/18, 11:19:03 AM] Justin: your trying to draw me back in here, i'm not taking this bate lol
[2/8/18, 11:19:47 AM] Launchpad: This is saying I shouldn't lend the poor money
[2/8/18, 11:19:59 AM] Justin: and no interest on returns
[2/8/18, 11:20:12 AM] Justin: so loans, investment etc
[2/8/18, 11:20:18 AM] Launchpad: no loan, no interest
[2/8/18, 11:20:31 AM] Launchpad: doesn't say investment
[2/8/18, 11:21:00 AM] Justin: lol
[2/8/18, 11:21:57 AM] Launchpad: anyways, complain all you want
[2/8/18, 11:22:00 AM] Launchpad: once I retire, Ill have a lot more free time so we can hang out
[2/8/18, 11:22:12 AM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/8/18, 11:22:16 AM] Launchpad: and Im gonna kick your ass in street fighter
[2/8/18, 11:22:34 AM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôll fuck your world up in street fighter
[2/8/18, 11:24:30 AM] Justin: mortal kombat
[2/8/18, 11:24:56 AM] Brian Katz: I can hang if you go back to MK 1 or 2
[2/8/18, 11:25:06 AM] Launchpad: nah MK10 is the best
[2/8/18, 11:25:11 AM] Launchpad: for ps4
[2/8/18, 11:25:18 AM] Justin: gettign back at this
[2/8/18, 11:25:20 AM] Justin: We're doing my homework assignment now thanks to sean .....  "Gladiator, the Dark Knight, Grandmas boy,   Shaun of the dead, Kill Bill, Zombieland "  Score each on 1-5 basis
[2/8/18, 11:25:20 AM] Brian Katz: MK 10?
[2/8/18, 11:25:28 AM] Justin: help me out here katz and lp
[2/8/18, 11:25:44 AM] Justin: do what miller did
[2/8/18, 11:26:05 AM] Justin: this format 5,4,5,3,5,4
[2/8/18, 11:26:19 AM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs unfair to rank these together because of the vastly different natures of the films
[2/8/18, 11:26:27 AM] Justin: not together
[2/8/18, 11:26:30 AM] Justin: just 1-5 each
[2/8/18, 11:26:33 AM] Brian Katz: Like grandmas boy is a 4 for a comedy
[2/8/18, 11:26:41 AM] Justin: i here ya
[2/8/18, 11:26:48 AM] Justin: didnt think about that, although its interesting point
[2/8/18, 11:26:49 AM] Brian Katz: Gladiator is a 4 in generalities
[2/8/18, 11:27:21 AM] Brian Katz: Kill bill is a 5 for me, but I‚Äôm including both volumes
[2/8/18, 11:27:22 AM] Justin: imagine you saw the movie and were goign to rottem tomatoes to rate it i guess
[2/8/18, 11:27:55 AM] Brian Katz: Kill bill vol 1/2 is a 94
[2/8/18, 11:28:12 AM] Brian Katz: Gladiator is a 83
[2/8/18, 11:28:29 AM] Justin: nah still give me 1-5 scale lol
[2/8/18, 11:28:30 AM] Brian Katz: Shaun of the dead is a 88
[2/8/18, 11:28:41 AM] Justin: i meant as if rotten tomatoes was 1-5
[2/8/18, 11:28:46 AM] Brian Katz: I can‚Äôt be handcuffed by these rules
[2/8/18, 11:28:49 AM] Justin: what would you give them on rotten tomatoes
[2/8/18, 11:29:06 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs 1-100 right?
[2/8/18, 11:29:09 AM] Justin: i mean im fully capable of lying about these numbers
[2/8/18, 11:29:19 AM] Justin: but figured it was up your alley
[2/8/18, 11:29:56 AM] Justin: althoguh if i can comment at the end i will bring up your issue
[2/8/18, 11:30:13 AM] Brian Katz: Okay so only 1-5 then?
[2/8/18, 11:30:23 AM] Justin: yeh
[2/8/18, 11:31:28 AM] Justin: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[2/8/18, 11:31:35 AM] Justin: that didnt work out well
[2/8/18, 11:33:44 AM] Brian Katz: Gladiator-5
Shaun of the dead-5 
Dark knight-5
Zombie land -4
Kill bill-gladiator-5
Grandmas boy-4
My system is as follows
1= 0-20
2=21-40
3=41-60
4= 61-80
5= 81-100
[2/8/18, 11:37:08 AM] Justin: thats fair
[2/8/18, 11:37:31 AM] Justin: solid system i think.....
[2/8/18, 12:28:58 PM] Launchpad: stocks in freefall mode today
[2/8/18, 12:39:41 PM] James  L: Zombie land is an all time fav of mine
[2/8/18, 12:39:54 PM] James  L: Have to watch it no matter what‚Äôs on
[2/8/18, 12:40:06 PM] Scott: Surprisingly a good movie
[2/8/18, 12:41:01 PM] Kiyoon: I feel like not a lot of people have seen that movie
[2/8/18, 12:41:44 PM] Miller: Made 100m
[2/8/18, 12:41:57 PM] Miller: And I venture everyone in this chat except sean has seen it
[2/8/18, 12:42:15 PM] Brian Katz: I love zombie movies and this one was great. But in the grand scheme of movies I can‚Äôt rank it as high.
[2/8/18, 12:42:42 PM] Miller: It was good, it wasn't gladiator or kill Bill good
[2/8/18, 12:43:35 PM] Kiyoon: did you guys watch it in theatres?
[2/8/18, 12:43:47 PM] Miller: I did
[2/8/18, 12:43:48 PM] Kiyoon: I actually dont remember it being in theatres, I watched it like 2 years later
[2/8/18, 12:47:47 PM] Brian Katz: I saw it in theaters
[2/8/18, 1:07:47 PM] Miller: @wojespn: Cleveland is trading Dwyane Wade to Miami, league sources tell ESPN.
[2/8/18, 1:07:49 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/18, 1:07:49 PM] Miller: Chaos

[2/8/18, 1:29:41 PM] Kiyoon: with a solid player LeBron, or DeAndre Hopkins in your case
[2/8/18, 1:32:28 PM] Scott: huh

[2/8/18, 1:43:16 PM] Brian Katz: This Sunday cheese! You ready for some free throws?
[2/8/18, 1:43:35 PM] Scott: yes queen yes.
[2/8/18, 1:44:20 PM] Brian Katz: No way a man with your Sasquatch hands can shoot 70%
[2/8/18, 1:44:31 PM] Scott: says who? you?
[2/8/18, 1:44:39 PM] Brian Katz: Yes says me
[2/8/18, 1:44:43 PM] Scott: lets see you play ball with us tho
[2/8/18, 1:44:51 PM] Brian Katz: I can‚Äôt wait
[2/8/18, 1:44:56 PM] Scott: no
[2/8/18, 1:44:57 PM] Scott: i can't wait.
[2/8/18, 1:45:25 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt seen your athletic prowess. I‚Äôm not remotely scared of it.
[2/8/18, 1:46:03 PM] Brian Katz: Are you one of the better guys there?
[2/8/18, 1:47:21 PM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[2/8/18, 1:49:15 PM] Scott: no, but everyone can play
[2/8/18, 1:49:16 PM] Scott: as can i.
[2/8/18, 1:49:25 PM] Scott: do you play?
[2/8/18, 1:51:10 PM] Brian Katz: I play with the guys at la fitness, so not really. I can play good D, board and box out.
[2/8/18, 1:51:23 PM] Brian Katz: You look like a cherry picker one way player cheese
[2/8/18, 1:51:53 PM] Brian Katz: Standing at the three point line waiting for a pass that‚Äôs never coming.
[2/8/18, 1:54:20 PM] Kiyoon: on point
[2/8/18, 1:54:43 PM] Scott: we shall see.
[2/8/18, 1:55:00 PM] Scott: im not that great by any means, but i hate being completely underestimated
[2/8/18, 1:55:17 PM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/18, 1:56:58 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs half more of the court that‚Äôs unnecessarily shaded
[2/8/18, 1:58:37 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese I lost all hope for you athletically when you beat the coverage deep and I threw to you wide open. You stopped running for reasons only known to yourself. That killed me a little inside.
[2/8/18, 1:59:13 PM] Tk: Garopollo $27.5 a yr $137 5yrs after 10gms of audition. Must be niceüòí
[2/8/18, 1:59:37 PM] Justin: more importantly, how tight you gonna guard a sweaty Cheese ?  Body Hair sticking out of his wife beater from all directions
[2/8/18, 2:00:45 PM] Brian Katz: If he‚Äôs cherry picking idk what I‚Äôll do. I don‚Äôt want my rep tainted because of that. If he plays both ways? It‚Äôll be the worst experience he‚Äôs ever had in a basketball court.
[2/8/18, 2:01:08 PM] Scott: ok shaquille o'katz.
[2/8/18, 2:02:24 PM] Brian Katz: Cheese I lost 100 lbs. I run 3k‚Äôs 3 times a week. I play at la fitness with much better guys than you play with. I‚Äôm not going to get tired guarding you like you‚Äôre hoping.
[2/8/18, 2:03:21 PM] Kiyoon: are you guys playing 1V1?
[2/8/18, 2:03:49 PM] Scott: im not disputing that you are in good physical shape, thats not all of it tho
[2/8/18, 2:03:52 PM] Brian Katz: I assume we‚Äôre playing a team game, considering cheese has like 20 guys that share this court.
[2/8/18, 2:04:06 PM] Kiyoon: ahhh you're going to go play with his boys
[2/8/18, 2:04:18 PM] Kiyoon: wait so are the free throws happenin
[2/8/18, 2:04:19 PM] Brian Katz: You trying to call me Katz Diesel?
[2/8/18, 2:04:37 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah I‚Äôm sure everyone warms up
[2/8/18, 2:05:06 PM] Brian Katz: As long as cheese doesn‚Äôt have some Jason kidd type of pre shot ritual we should be good.
[2/8/18, 2:13:53 PM] Kiyoon: I had a ritual for FTs so I can't make fun of cheese if he pulls kisses to his family
[2/8/18, 2:14:53 PM] Kiyoon: I'll give Cheese credit he was an ok shooter

[2/9/18, 11:23:35 AM] Scott: unbelievable
[2/9/18, 11:23:48 AM] Scott: can't be real
[2/9/18, 11:24:02 AM] Brian Katz: You know what? I‚Äôve decided I want to be black. Let‚Äôs see how this goes for me.
[2/9/18, 11:24:27 AM] Miller: yea shes obviously trolling, if the equating being anti-incest to being islamaphobic didnt give it away then the black or gay comment should have
[2/9/18, 11:24:52 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/9/18, 11:25:25 AM] Brian Katz: Lol I forgot about that bitch. Maybe it might work out for me.

[2/9/18, 11:45:22 AM] Scott: wow uber settled case with waymo for $72B or 34% of the company's equity
[2/9/18, 11:49:15 AM] Miller: LOL
[2/9/18, 11:49:32 AM] Justin: wow reading about that now
[2/9/18, 11:49:34 AM] Miller: missing a decimal point there, no big deal
[2/9/18, 11:49:44 AM] Miller: try .34% of their equity
[2/9/18, 11:49:45 AM] Scott: you're right
[2/9/18, 11:49:46 AM] Scott: my bad
[2/9/18, 11:49:46 AM] Scott: lol
[2/9/18, 11:49:52 AM] Scott: hahahaha i just realized that
[2/9/18, 11:50:10 AM] Launchpad: hahahaha
[2/9/18, 11:50:17 AM] Miller: and its 245m not 72B
[2/9/18, 11:50:27 AM] Justin: lol
[2/9/18, 11:50:30 AM] Launchpad: you just killed his lawyer boner
[2/9/18, 11:50:34 AM] Miller: but otherwise you nailed it
[2/9/18, 11:50:34 AM] Justin: cheese fake news
[2/9/18, 11:50:36 AM] Scott: lol
[2/9/18, 11:50:42 AM] Scott: the legal update i have fucked it up
[2/9/18, 11:50:53 AM] Scott: BREAKING: Uber To Pay $72B To Settle Waymo Trade Secret Case

Waymo and Uber have reached a settlement of their self-driving car trade secret fight a third of the way through trial, with Uber agreeing to give Waymo 0.34 percent of Uber equity, valued at about $72 billion.
[2/9/18, 11:50:58 AM] Justin: pretty fucked up though, so they pretty much stole some companies propritory tech
[2/9/18, 11:51:03 AM] Scott: so yeah
[2/9/18, 11:51:08 AM] Scott: its about 245 million right
[2/9/18, 11:51:41 AM] Justin: which they will eventually use to eliminate all the uber drivers
[2/9/18, 11:51:58 AM] Miller: cant wait
[2/9/18, 11:52:02 AM] Miller: im over cab drivers
[2/9/18, 11:52:29 AM] Justin: but if you can just own a self drivning car that parks itself and picks you up?
[2/9/18, 11:52:44 AM] Launchpad: cant wait that labor will free up to do other things
[2/9/18, 11:52:54 AM] Justin: lol yeh, sure it will
[2/9/18, 11:53:05 AM] Miller: yea mass exodus of cab drivers into blockchain developers seems lilely
[2/9/18, 11:53:13 AM] Launchpad: technology has been eliminating jobs since the beginning of time
[2/9/18, 11:53:19 AM] Justin: labor was super free to do other things. thats why 40k cab drivers turned into 200k in nyc
[2/9/18, 11:53:26 AM] Justin: at below the median income line
[2/9/18, 11:53:33 AM] Justin: oppurtunities everywhere
[2/9/18, 11:53:49 AM] Miller: doubt cab drivers in nyc are below the median income level
[2/9/18, 11:54:28 AM] Justin: https://www.democracynow.org/2018/2/7/nyc_taxi_driver_kills_himself_at
[2/9/18, 11:54:31 AM] Launchpad: stop being so anti-technology
[2/9/18, 11:54:44 AM] Justin: i wasnt anti technology, your comment was shit
[2/9/18, 11:54:52 AM] Miller: lots of investment bankers kill themselves
[2/9/18, 11:54:55 AM] Justin: just poitning out that relaity
[2/9/18, 11:54:56 AM] Miller: are they below the median income levels?
[2/9/18, 11:55:17 AM] Launchpad: lolol
[2/9/18, 11:55:28 AM] Justin: well for one, my comment is more directed at uber drivers
[2/9/18, 11:55:33 AM] Justin: but im sure cheeese might know this answer
[2/9/18, 11:55:40 AM] Justin: what is median income of uber driver in nyc
[2/9/18, 11:55:46 AM] Launchpad: tech is coming for bankers too, that should make you happy
[2/9/18, 11:55:50 AM] Miller: tough, so few uber drivers are full time uber
[2/9/18, 11:56:15 AM] Justin: once again, if it replaces the abnkers, my answer wont be " that will free up labor rto be more productive"
[2/9/18, 11:56:16 AM] Miller: but considering yellow cab drivers make ~70k/yr or something full time and they were switching to uber i would assume it is more
[2/9/18, 11:57:16 AM] Scott: it isn't more
[2/9/18, 11:57:28 AM] Launchpad: maybe we should bring back the buggy manufacturing jobs
[2/9/18, 11:57:29 AM] Justin: well yellow cabs was 30k in 2010 miller in nyc
[2/9/18, 11:57:34 AM] Miller: then they should go back to yellow cabs
[2/9/18, 11:57:34 AM] Justin: so tehres that
[2/9/18, 11:57:40 AM] Scott: its hard to say though, tbh, so few are "full time", some work a lot more than 40 hours, and a huge percentage work less than 10 hours a week
[2/9/18, 11:57:55 AM] Justin: so those working 40 hours, any idea on hourly wages?
[2/9/18, 11:58:09 AM] Scott: there are a lot of drivers who work less than 10 hours which would bring it down
[2/9/18, 11:58:14 AM] Scott: again, not sure
[2/9/18, 11:58:15 AM] Justin: median income in nyc is above this fyi
[2/9/18, 11:58:21 AM] Scott: some drivers only do airport runs
[2/9/18, 11:58:22 AM] Scott: maybe 1 an hour
[2/9/18, 11:58:25 AM] Scott: some do short routes
[2/9/18, 11:58:32 AM] Scott: then you ahve the uber pool v. regular uber
[2/9/18, 11:58:37 AM] Scott: it honestly completely depends
[2/9/18, 11:58:50 AM] Scott: also you have variability with price increase due to sruge pricing etc
[2/9/18, 11:59:03 AM] Justin: yeh but average would take care of priceing surges
[2/9/18, 11:59:19 AM] Scott: i'll tell you this
[2/9/18, 11:59:27 AM] Scott: the majority of uber drivers i rep make between $30k and $60k
[2/9/18, 11:59:35 AM] Justin: ok thats all i needed to know
[2/9/18, 11:59:38 AM] Scott: and the ones on teh higher end work more than 40 hours per week to get there
[2/9/18, 11:59:40 AM] Scott: expenses are high
[2/9/18, 11:59:49 AM] Scott: especially those that rent commercial leases weekly
[2/9/18, 11:59:59 AM] Scott: some uber drivers pay upwards of $800/wk for their cars
[2/9/18, 12:00:08 PM] Scott: so thats why they make so little alot
[2/9/18, 12:00:10 PM] Scott: alot fo them
[2/9/18, 12:00:22 PM] Justin: so do you think 30-60 is take home or before expenses?
[2/9/18, 12:00:37 PM] Scott: before
[2/9/18, 12:00:48 PM] Justin: ok so here we are, cheese made my argument for me
[2/9/18, 12:00:58 PM] Justin: thank you for info, honestly cant find that online
[2/9/18, 12:01:07 PM] Justin: wapo article headline is uber is great and people making 90k plus
[2/9/18, 12:01:24 PM] Scott: to make a real living on uber the best way to do it, is to get upfront investment and network with other drivers and add them under your company and then collect from tehre
[2/9/18, 12:01:35 PM] Scott: some are making 90k plus
[2/9/18, 12:01:41 PM] Scott: but it certainly cant be take home
[2/9/18, 12:01:46 PM] Justin: meanwhile  uber ceo is giving bezos a handjob in the back of some random uber
[2/9/18, 12:01:49 PM] Donk: yeah, cant say you make 30 to 60k driving uber but then say its before expenses
[2/9/18, 12:02:26 PM] Justin: what you mena by this?
[2/9/18, 12:04:05 PM] Justin: also this kinda got away form main point that uber pretty much told some dudes to start a company by stealing technology from their current employer and uber then purchased that company
[2/9/18, 12:04:39 PM] Justin: they got some swag
[2/9/18, 12:06:08 PM] Donk: and basically got a slap on the wrist for it
[2/9/18, 12:06:28 PM] Donk: similar to how Samsung stole a shit ton of stuff from the iphone when making the first galaxy phones, and then fought in court ofr years
[2/9/18, 12:06:39 PM] Donk: paid a reliatively small penalty for it
[2/9/18, 12:06:44 PM] Donk: but keeps all of the gained market share
[2/9/18, 12:09:36 PM] Miller: Uber Pay New York / Uber Driver Earnings in NYC
Below, we explore how much money Uber drivers make in New York City.

Who qualifies as an ‚Äòaverage‚Äô driver? And what kind of variables are being taken into account when assembling salary estimates?

How much is an Uber driver‚Äôs salary in New York?
At IDWU, we estimate that Uber drivers in New York make approximately $80,839 per year (take a look at our entire list of Uber pay estimates by city for more salary estimates).

Average Uber Driver Hours
An average Uber driver in NYC works approximately 30 hours per week.

The average trip for an Uber driver pays out $25.91, and drivers reportedly complete about 2 full trips per hour (equating to a total hourly wage of $51.82).

Since an average Uber driver works about 30 hours per week, the total amount for New York City comes out to $1554 per week ‚Äî meaning that a full year‚Äôs salary for an Uber driver in New York is approximately $80,839.
[2/9/18, 12:11:31 PM] Scott: that is a high
[2/9/18, 12:11:38 PM] Scott: and certainly not inclusive of expenses
[2/9/18, 12:12:44 PM] Miller: https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/uber-study/
[2/9/18, 12:12:48 PM] Miller: says $30/hr for NYC
[2/9/18, 12:13:05 PM] Miller: idk how much expenses are - one article estimates 10% for gas/car maintenance
[2/9/18, 12:13:35 PM] Scott: that can't be when the majority of uber drivers rent from Tower or other commercial lenders and they pay at least $300 plus per week for their car
[2/9/18, 12:13:43 PM] Justin: You dont see the problem with any this data?
[2/9/18, 12:13:50 PM] Scott: that's just cost of rental alone
[2/9/18, 12:13:59 PM] Scott: and frnakly its much higher most i have encountered is like $500
[2/9/18, 12:14:09 PM] Justin: Uber survey reveals the wages of uber drivers. ü§î
[2/9/18, 12:14:15 PM] Miller: so cheese if you buy a car can i deduct that from your income?
[2/9/18, 12:14:23 PM] Miller: can i deduct my car insurance from my income?
[2/9/18, 12:14:28 PM] Justin: Fake Science at its best
[2/9/18, 12:14:35 PM] Scott: its part of the tools of the trade
[2/9/18, 12:14:39 PM] Scott: adn teh costs of thier busines
[2/9/18, 12:14:44 PM] Miller: its also a car
[2/9/18, 12:14:49 PM] Miller: something 90% of the country has anyway
[2/9/18, 12:14:54 PM] Scott: really?
[2/9/18, 12:14:55 PM] Scott: yeah no.
[2/9/18, 12:14:57 PM] Scott: not in teh 5 boroughs
[2/9/18, 12:14:58 PM] Justin: Miller you realize the car requirements in NYC?
[2/9/18, 12:15:01 PM] Scott: alot of ppl dont have cars
[2/9/18, 12:15:06 PM] Justin: It's not like nj
[2/9/18, 12:15:09 PM] Scott: they also need certain requirements
[2/9/18, 12:15:18 PM] Scott: like within certain year make and model
[2/9/18, 12:15:19 PM] Scott: etc.
[2/9/18, 12:15:20 PM] Justin: I'm sure cheese can expand
[2/9/18, 12:15:21 PM] Donk: yeah, you def have to factor in the cost of the car, esp if you are renting specifically to drive uber
[2/9/18, 12:15:47 PM] Justin: Think it's something like car has to be within past 5 years. Has to apply for tlc
[2/9/18, 12:15:59 PM] Justin: It's fucken expensive to drive uber in NYC
[2/9/18, 12:16:13 PM] Justin: And your insurance rate as a driver is insane
[2/9/18, 12:16:46 PM] Justin: Now a solid lp argument to that would be that's NYC regulations fault
[2/9/18, 12:16:57 PM] Scott: most of these ppl pumped gas at gas stations and had lesser menial jobs, they certianly weren't driving around vehicles that uber would say are okay to drive in
[2/9/18, 12:17:02 PM] Scott: they had to get those cars just to be uber drivers
[2/9/18, 12:17:30 PM] Scott: hence the employment law term "tools of the trade" and part of alot of the similar suits as mine aroundt he coutnry
[2/9/18, 12:17:47 PM] Scott: i.e. should they have been called an emmployee, argument cna be made that the employer pays tools of the trade i.e. for the car, such as a chef with knives
[2/9/18, 12:18:16 PM] Miller: wait i just did the math, you guys are right
[2/9/18, 12:18:38 PM] Miller: if i rent a lambo at $28k/month, i will lose ~150k/yr driving with uber
[2/9/18, 12:18:47 PM] Justin: Lol.
[2/9/18, 12:18:49 PM] Scott: you're a moron.
[2/9/18, 12:18:57 PM] Miller: also if i rent a penthouse in NYC for $25k/month my job becomes a lot less profitable
[2/9/18, 12:19:11 PM] Miller: this is all groundbreaking stuff guys
[2/9/18, 12:19:25 PM] Justin: Uber did the math as well. Their drivers make 90 k. They even published an article you mimicked like a good puppy
[2/9/18, 12:19:40 PM] Miller: investment banking is actually a negative income job when you factor in all the suits and watches you need to buy
[2/9/18, 12:20:09 PM] Justin: Meanwhile cheese literally deals with 100's of NYC uber drivers. Admitted it's difficult to assess what is full time driver and gave a fair estimate
[2/9/18, 12:20:19 PM] Miller: lets examine me today, do i count my car or insurance against my income? no i do not
[2/9/18, 12:20:26 PM] Justin: Lol
[2/9/18, 12:20:26 PM] Miller: now tomorrow if i start driving for uber all of a sudden its an expense?
[2/9/18, 12:20:34 PM] Miller: (NOT counting gas or depreciation/maintenance)
[2/9/18, 12:20:40 PM] Justin: Your car insurance isn't 400% higher because your job
[2/9/18, 12:20:52 PM] Miller: is an uber driver? i have no idea
[2/9/18, 12:20:53 PM] Justin: It's insane you would t count it
[2/9/18, 12:20:59 PM] Miller: if so then yes the increase in insurance expense would count
[2/9/18, 12:21:05 PM] Justin: Of course it is.
[2/9/18, 12:21:15 PM] Donk: now what if you dont own a car, but rent one to drive for uber?
[2/9/18, 12:22:02 PM] Justin: Idk the number by once again cheese might
[2/9/18, 12:22:08 PM] Miller: then the job probably makes a lot less economic sense
[2/9/18, 12:22:16 PM] Miller: similar to if i wanted to rent out a place on airbnb for $
[2/9/18, 12:22:20 PM] Justin: Yeh which most drivers dont realize
[2/9/18, 12:22:20 PM] Miller: but i had to buy the place first
[2/9/18, 12:22:28 PM] Justin: Which is the brilliance of the gig economy
[2/9/18, 12:22:48 PM] Justin: Also need to pay ss and Medicaire. So that's 16% on top of income tax
[2/9/18, 12:23:00 PM] Justin: Your employer pays 8% of that
[2/9/18, 12:23:42 PM] Justin: So off the bat they lose 8% hourly wage, although good accountant can bring that down
[2/9/18, 1:36:24 PM] Justin: in case anyone was wondering...women have shitty taste in movies
[2/9/18, 1:36:30 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/9/18, 1:37:07 PM] Miller: 2 of those are hermans so no surprise there

[2/9/18, 1:56:25 PM] Brian Katz: Who‚Äôs briana?
[2/9/18, 1:56:45 PM] Justin: Joias coworker

[2/9/18, 1:59:17 PM] Justin: every movie got a 5 rotten tomatoes user score slol
[2/9/18, 2:12:21 PM] Dan Watts: 2 movies from the late 90s: early 2000s that I like- vanilla sky and the beach are shat on rotten tomatoes
[2/9/18, 2:13:50 PM] Brian Katz: The beach and vanilla sky are both whack
[2/9/18, 2:14:04 PM] Justin: lol
[2/9/18, 2:14:33 PM] Justin: yeh, at the bottom of leo movies, and i dont think i made it thru vanilla sky
[2/9/18, 2:14:46 PM] Miller: vanilla sky was awesome
[2/9/18, 2:15:00 PM] Brian Katz: This is not the case
[2/9/18, 2:16:18 PM] Scott: Vanilla sky was great.
[2/9/18, 2:16:37 PM] Brian Katz: This is also not the case.
[2/9/18, 2:49:24 PM] Donk: Love vanilla sky
[2/9/18, 2:49:50 PM] Dan Watts: The Yay's have it
[2/9/18, 2:50:07 PM] Donk: Gotta love any movie that opens with a radiohead song

[2/9/18, 2:50:21 PM] Brian Katz: You need to look at yourself in the mirror, and really think about all you‚Äôve done up until this point.
[2/9/18, 2:51:58 PM] Brian Katz: Damn donk get off Cheese‚Äôs nuts
[2/9/18, 2:52:14 PM] Donk: What are your feelings on almost famous or jerry mcguire?
[2/9/18, 2:53:29 PM] Brian Katz: I enjoyed both of those movies
[2/9/18, 2:53:39 PM] Launchpad: Cliffhanger
[2/9/18, 2:53:47 PM] Brian Katz: That movie is bomb
[2/9/18, 2:53:50 PM] Launchpad: now thats an underrated movie
[2/9/18, 2:54:11 PM] Brian Katz: Demotion man too
[2/9/18, 2:54:14 PM] Donk: Hmm, this surprises me given your hate of vanilla sky
[2/9/18, 2:54:23 PM] Brian Katz: Demolition *
[2/9/18, 2:54:34 PM] Donk: I think cliffhanger is accurately rated as a fun action movie
[2/9/18, 2:54:44 PM] Brian Katz: What do those three movies have in common?
[2/9/18, 2:54:55 PM] Donk: Director
[2/9/18, 2:55:30 PM] Donk: And writer

[2/9/18, 3:08:35 PM] Dan Watts: Except that chart is not in accordance with the majority of this chat
[2/9/18, 3:08:37 PM] Scott: chart was created on opposite day.  movie is pretty good.
[2/9/18, 3:08:40 PM] Dan Watts: I think it 4-2

I can't wait to plan and go on even more with you this year!  It brightens my heart to say that I've found the best travel partner, someone I can enjoy all the miles with, someone who'll help pack my clothes in a foreign country, someone who'll remember to keep my passport safe when I forget üòâ.  I love you so very much, to the moon and back!

[2/11/18, 8:27:07 PM] Miller: Dubbing really annoying me
[2/11/18, 8:27:24 PM] Donk: I didnt find it all that distracting
[2/11/18, 8:27:41 PM] Donk: It was better than subtitles i think
[2/11/18, 8:29:21 PM] Miller: It's odd I have both on and the words are slightly different from the subtitles
[2/11/18, 8:32:18 PM] Donk: Ha, that is strange. Probably produced separately

[2/12/18, 8:47:32 AM] Miller: When people meet me in-person they‚Äôre usually surprised that I‚Äôm 6-feet tall. While shooting the final scene on the beach in Jamaica, the crew dug a hole in the sand for me to stand in next to Buddha to exaggerate our height differences.
[2/12/18, 8:47:34 AM] Miller: lmao
[2/12/18, 8:49:57 AM] Donk: i was shocked by how much they basically make fun of midget mac for being a midgit
[2/12/18, 8:50:12 AM] Donk: they def wouldnt have gotten away with that today
[2/12/18, 8:51:16 AM] Donk: also, they did that guy so dirty, during the moments where they show the guys being interviewed, they also set the camera up so that it only shows him from like the mouth up to show him as even shorter
[2/12/18, 8:54:23 AM] Miller: that guy will live in infamy on the outro of all of me (top 5 joe budden song)
[2/12/18, 8:54:24 AM] Miller: Just sayin', it's always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep
Thinkin' I'm on the last chapter
No tit for tat, I ain't equipped for that
Back in New York, chit chat with a Midget Mack
As I get older...I keep gettin' sick of rap
Wanna call it quits, but a nigga can't picture that...

[2/12/18, 10:59:42 AM] Miller: nope
[2/12/18, 10:59:48 AM] Donk: but its because they adjusted the tax tables
[2/12/18, 11:00:45 AM] Launchpad: because my last paycheck was up pretty significantly
[2/12/18, 11:00:49 AM] Launchpad: like 12%
[2/12/18, 11:01:00 AM] Launchpad: not sure if this is the new normal or a fluke
[2/12/18, 11:01:58 AM] Donk: mine wasnt nearly that much
[2/12/18, 11:02:06 AM] Kiyoon: yeah mine was like 3-4%
[2/12/18, 11:02:15 AM] Kiyoon: 12% would be nice
[2/12/18, 11:02:17 AM] Donk: yeah, same
[2/12/18, 11:02:35 AM] Kiyoon: do you get paid biweekly?
[2/12/18, 11:02:45 AM] Launchpad: yeah
[2/12/18, 11:02:47 AM] Donk: bi-monthly
[2/12/18, 11:02:56 AM] Launchpad: lol yeah that
[2/12/18, 11:03:01 AM] Kiyoon: lol my bad
[2/12/18, 11:03:07 AM] Donk: no, you may be right
[2/12/18, 11:03:08 AM] Launchpad: technically every 2 weeks
[2/12/18, 11:03:10 AM] Launchpad: 26 a year
[2/12/18, 11:03:14 AM] Miller: bi-weekly can mean both
[2/12/18, 11:03:19 AM] Donk: thats bi-weekly
[2/12/18, 11:03:21 AM] Kiyoon: thats confusing
[2/12/18, 11:03:26 AM] Donk: bi-weekly = 26 pay periods
[2/12/18, 11:03:27 AM] Launchpad: Thank You Donald ü§§ü§§ü§§
[2/12/18, 11:03:32 AM] Donk: bi-monthly - 24 pay periods
[2/12/18, 11:03:42 AM] Miller: bi-weekly has a weird double meaning that is both 2x/week and once every other week
[2/12/18, 11:04:44 AM] Launchpad: 12 percent on my check is pretty significant
[2/12/18, 11:05:09 AM] Donk: i wonder if they did a catch up for you
[2/12/18, 11:05:22 AM] Launchpad: I think I reduced some of HSA contributions but thats only a small part of that 12%
[2/12/18, 11:05:27 AM] Kiyoon: so you're immediately putting that in Crypto right
[2/12/18, 11:06:22 AM] Launchpad: EOS üìàüìàüìà
[2/12/18, 11:07:43 AM] Launchpad: kind of hoping this is the new normal
[2/12/18, 1:06:02 PM] Justin: might want to look into this The new law means that the W-4 you filled out however many years ago may need to be recalibrated. The IRS came out with new withholding tables on Jan. 11 that reflect changes such as the elimination of personal exemptions in the new tax law, but has yet to release an updated withholding calculator or a revised W-4 form. Additionally, the new tables don't reflect all the changes that may affect a taxpayer next year, so they're a somewhat of a blunt tool.

If workers leave their W-4 as is, they could wind up withholding too little, which can bring penalties, or they may get a smaller-than-expected refund next year. Workers in higher tax brackets who receive large bonuses could see a higher tax bill next season if they don't tweak W-4s, since one of the ways employers can set the withholding rate on "supplemental income" such as bonuses in the new law is to use a flat rate of 22 percent.
[2/12/18, 1:06:26 PM] Justin: but might not effect you, may really only effect families
[2/12/18, 1:09:24 PM] Launchpad: üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2/12/18, 1:10:03 PM] Launchpad: in other news, I know how yall hate Uber around here
[2/12/18, 1:10:07 PM] Launchpad: https://steemit.com/eos/@ofthefuture/eos-reinventing-legecy-application-for-drivers-riders-developers-and-entreprenuers
[2/12/18, 1:10:43 PM] Miller: i dont think thats a "around here" thing pretty sure everyone hates uber
[2/12/18, 1:10:56 PM] Launchpad: I dont
[2/12/18, 1:11:31 PM] Miller: its a generic everyone, not meant to mean 100% of people on a literal basis, if that was the case the word "everyone" would be almost useless
[2/12/18, 1:12:29 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RpmwqaxrwA
[2/12/18, 1:13:00 PM] Miller: "some people still like uber"
[2/12/18, 1:13:10 PM] Scott: most people hate uber
[2/12/18, 1:13:17 PM] Scott: i just so happen to dislike them a bit more than most
[2/12/18, 1:13:47 PM] Donk: i have no feelings on uber, positive or negative
[2/12/18, 1:14:42 PM] Miller: that surprises me
[2/12/18, 1:15:04 PM] Donk: i dont think i have ever called an uber on my own
[2/12/18, 1:16:24 PM] Miller: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber#Criticism i mean i cannot find a defensible thing about the company
[2/12/18, 1:17:21 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/12/18, 1:17:36 PM] Launchpad: maybe thats why I like them lol
[2/12/18, 1:18:31 PM] Donk: well, alot of those are pretty damning if true
[2/12/18, 1:19:13 PM] Donk: i knew about the theft of the google self driving car research and the generally assholeness of the management
[2/12/18, 1:19:31 PM] Scott: its pretty amazing how they do business
[2/12/18, 1:19:36 PM] Donk: but some of these are pretty straight up evil, like the calling of rides on other services and then cancling them to frustrate their drivers
[2/12/18, 1:19:39 PM] Scott: honestly, juno isn't much better
[2/12/18, 1:19:41 PM] Donk: thats pretty evil genius
[2/12/18, 1:19:55 PM] Miller: they started out with good intentions, but yes
[2/12/18, 1:20:03 PM] Miller: and im sure lyft is bad also
[2/12/18, 1:20:08 PM] Miller: but need to get around somehow
[2/12/18, 1:20:12 PM] Scott: juno was better intentioned
[2/12/18, 1:20:15 PM] Scott: but they are terrible
[2/12/18, 1:20:23 PM] Scott: and lyft is pretty bad, but not as bad as uber
[2/12/18, 1:20:29 PM] Scott: at least htey permitted and didn't discourage tipping
[2/12/18, 1:20:34 PM] Miller: and i still use uber if need be, not gonna spite myself to that extent
[2/12/18, 1:20:43 PM] Miller: but still think company is a POS
[2/12/18, 1:20:49 PM] Scott: if i use uber, i cash tip
[2/12/18, 1:23:28 PM] Kiyoon: do drivers not get their full tip?
[2/12/18, 1:23:56 PM] Scott: ugh
[2/12/18, 1:24:04 PM] Scott: they weren't
[2/12/18, 1:24:36 PM] Scott: at first when uber came out they discouraged tipping saying that it was supposed to be a seamless, cash-free transaction, and that tipping was not including and they told the drivers in training that htey were not allowed to accept cash tips unless htey rejected them 3 times
[2/12/18, 1:24:40 PM] Donk: the problem with cash tips is having to have cash on you
[2/12/18, 1:24:59 PM] Scott: then, uber allows tipping, and they then fuck around with the taxes, black car fund, etc. so basically while you coudl tip, the drivers were getting fucked there
[2/12/18, 1:25:23 PM] Scott: and it hasn't been conclusively determined if they steal on tips, i'd say probably not, the violation on that under ny labor and employment law, even if independent contractors is outrageous
[2/12/18, 1:25:24 PM] Launchpad: I personally like the no tipping aspect
[2/12/18, 1:25:32 PM] Scott: but i'd say the theft on other things evens it out.
[2/12/18, 1:25:44 PM] Launchpad: would rather have higher prices and no tips
[2/12/18, 1:26:11 PM] Donk: i hate when you are picking up take out and they give you the reciept to sign and it has the tip line
[2/12/18, 1:26:24 PM] Donk: because no tipping should be nessecary on take out orders
[2/12/18, 1:26:39 PM] Donk: but then the person is standing there wathcing you write zero and its awkward lol
[2/12/18, 1:26:49 PM] Launchpad: whats even worse is the Square app which starts the tipping at like 15%
[2/12/18, 1:26:50 PM] Scott: if they want to make it seamless they should have a standard gratuity percentage included and allow ppl to appeal it shoudl they not find it suitable
[2/12/18, 1:27:12 PM] Donk: haha, yeah that is the worst
[2/12/18, 1:27:55 PM] Miller: i generally tip on takeout (less) but my thinking is some employee there had to spend the time to get it together or w/e and that is time they did not get to use either serving a table or delivering food or whatnot
[2/12/18, 1:28:12 PM] Miller: and 10% on ~$30-50 a couple times a month is not going to change my life
[2/12/18, 1:28:17 PM] Miller: its a slippery slope though for sure
[2/12/18, 1:28:43 PM] Launchpad: I almost always tip on takeout
[2/12/18, 1:28:44 PM] Donk: yeah, but the employees who are putting it together are rarely the waitresses
[2/12/18, 1:28:54 PM] Donk: and they are paid a full wage, not the waiter/waitress rate
[2/12/18, 1:28:57 PM] Brian Katz: I don‚Äôt tip on takeout
[2/12/18, 1:29:37 PM] Miller: i guess it depends, like i would tip at millers ale house takeout or something but if i picked up a pizza or chinese food im not  tipping
[2/12/18, 1:29:43 PM] Miller: actually i think i figured it out
[2/12/18, 1:29:51 PM] Donk: whats the logic on that?
[2/12/18, 1:29:55 PM] Launchpad: you think @16316620763 agrees with that?
[2/12/18, 1:29:56 PM] Miller: if the place offers delivery (pizza or chinese) and i forego the delivery im not tipping
[2/12/18, 1:30:10 PM] Miller: if the place does not offer delivery (bww, millers ale hours or w/e) then i will tip
[2/12/18, 1:30:11 PM] Brian Katz: If I‚Äôm not being served I‚Äôm not tipping
[2/12/18, 1:30:28 PM] Miller: not saying it makes any sense but a man has to have a system
[2/12/18, 1:30:45 PM] Donk: thats fair, cant argue with that
[2/12/18, 1:31:03 PM] Donk: similar to putting the dvd case ontop of the dvd player
[2/12/18, 1:31:22 PM] Launchpad: lol
[2/12/18, 1:31:22 PM] Donk: (something kids these days will never know about sadly)
[2/12/18, 1:31:26 PM] Justin: at justin thinks were currently passing laws that allow resturants to keep tips, so in the end all this logic dissappears
[2/12/18, 1:31:38 PM] Justin: and people gonna need to reevaluate
[2/12/18, 1:31:54 PM] Donk: the waiter/waitress wage is ridiculous
[2/12/18, 1:31:57 PM] Donk: and hasnt changed in like 30 years
[2/12/18, 1:32:03 PM] Miller: so no more tipping the chef, the hostess, the busboy, the bartender and the waiter?
[2/12/18, 1:32:12 PM] Miller: gonna save you a lot of $
[2/12/18, 1:32:15 PM] Donk: we should just handle it like europe - pay them a real wage, raise prices, and forgo tipping totally
[2/12/18, 1:32:55 PM] Miller: too logical, ppl are dumb and would complain about the higher prices, combined with the cultural issue b/c then people would instinctively still tip on top of it
[2/12/18, 1:32:58 PM] Launchpad: which is why I liked when Uber did it
[2/12/18, 1:33:35 PM] Justin: good luck getting that past the lobby
[2/12/18, 1:33:48 PM] Justin: they literlaly just figured out a way to steal tips and pay under mimmum wage
[2/12/18, 1:34:07 PM] Brian Katz: Agreed
[2/12/18, 1:34:43 PM] Justin: minues the rasining prices and real wage
[2/12/18, 1:34:51 PM] Launchpad: https://www.facebook.com/bodybuildersagainsttipping/
[2/12/18, 1:35:24 PM] Miller: cannot believe that is still going, thats like the oldest troll site in the world
[2/12/18, 1:36:49 PM] Launchpad: I recognize my privilege as a middle class white man in America, so I typically always leave at least $1 for takeout
[2/12/18, 1:37:36 PM] Launchpad: because if I don't talk about my privilege while giving away my money then I'm just part of the patriarchy
[2/12/18, 1:41:12 PM] Justin: pretty much
[2/12/18, 1:41:57 PM] Justin: one day you will figure this all out
[2/12/18, 1:43:24 PM] Justin: like becuase you like bitcoin, doesnt imply your an antisocial and anti capitalist
[2/12/18, 1:43:48 PM] Justin: notice how i can distinguish the two
[2/12/18, 1:55:23 PM] Launchpad: That's where I think you're wrong
[2/12/18, 2:12:53 PM] Justin: im not talking about your perception of it exists or doesnt exist, i fully get you will never change your mind here.  I mean for someone that doesn't think something exists, you have a firm viewpoint on what others mean when they accept it does exist.  It be like me redefining and classifying your overall opinion on everything because you invest in cypto.  Like if you invest in crypto you must keep your money under your mattress and not in E CORP, because if you believe in the fundamental transformation of this technology there is no way you would support an economic system which represses it
[2/12/18, 2:14:30 PM] Justin: Crypto and banking arent mutually exclusive, wow, that's mind bottling

[2/12/18, 2:29:27 PM] Launchpad: the 'invisible hand is holding me down' schtick is getting old
[2/12/18, 2:30:16 PM] Donk: you are incapoable of understanding this entire concept
[2/12/18, 2:30:26 PM] Donk: id say just give up at this point
[2/12/18, 2:30:29 PM] Launchpad: I understand it, but what can I do about it?
[2/12/18, 2:30:47 PM] Donk: stop taking it as a personal attack anytime says the word privilidge?

[2/12/18, 2:32:57 PM] Launchpad: Ill get outraged if I feel like it
[2/12/18, 2:35:36 PM] Launchpad: I never said that privilege doesn't exist. I say 'it exits, get over it'

[2/12/18, 8:23:32 PM] Scott: What happened
[2/12/18, 8:24:33 PM] Miller: They were running in my bedroom and Evan knocked Ryan over and he went headfirst into our dresser which meant face first into one of the metal knobs on the drawers
[2/12/18, 8:24:53 PM] Scott: How bad ?
[2/12/18, 8:25:31 PM] Miller: Don't know yet

[2/13/18, 10:08:12 AM] Launchpad: lets be real here....a 2 is several standard deviations away from average on the attractive scale. She was not a 2 not even close
[2/13/18, 10:08:30 AM] Launchpad: I wont even have this conversation if you put here anywhere lower than a 4
[2/13/18, 10:11:44 AM] Kiyoon: She was probably borderline 4
[2/13/18, 10:13:27 AM] Brian Katz: I heard she was a 2/3 at best. I‚Äôm just stating the facts from what the other gentleman have said that were in the trip.

[2/13/18, 10:17:21 AM] Brian Katz: She‚Äôs a black out 5 you‚Äôre saying?
[2/13/18, 10:17:24 AM] Donk: in the light of the day, not so much
[2/13/18, 10:17:37 AM] Launchpad: if anything the 5 is cause she was sloppy drunkish
[2/13/18, 10:17:45 AM] Launchpad: 23 year old girl drunk
[2/13/18, 10:18:38 AM] Launchpad: and I saw her facebook pictures -- she was cutish but got a little chubby
[2/13/18, 10:18:51 AM] Brian Katz: Present pics
[2/13/18, 10:19:58 AM] Launchpad: im not friends with her I tried searching
[2/13/18, 10:20:06 AM] Launchpad: ill let you know if she pops up again
[2/13/18, 10:20:22 AM] Launchpad: but these guys are haters and thats nothing new
[2/13/18, 10:21:12 AM] Miller: i honestly dont remember what she looks like at all
[2/13/18, 10:21:48 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/13/18, 10:22:03 AM] Miller: its been 2 years and i was blacked out drunk
[2/13/18, 10:23:23 AM] Dan Watts: http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/02/13/philippines-duterte-orders-female-communist-fighters-shot-in-genitals-reports-say.html
[2/13/18, 10:31:26 AM] Launchpad: basically your testimony means nothing
[2/13/18, 10:33:05 AM] Miller: i would agree w/that
[2/13/18, 10:33:27 AM] Miller: i also gave you the highest grade though so not sure you want my testimony getting dismissed
[2/13/18, 10:35:06 AM] Launchpad: lol
[2/13/18, 10:36:25 AM] Brian Katz: Clearly a 4
[2/13/18, 10:38:15 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/13/18, 10:38:48 AM] Launchpad: first of all that testimony is wrong
[2/13/18, 10:38:53 AM] Launchpad: she left well before the draft
[2/13/18, 10:39:03 AM] Launchpad: we woke up got breakfast and she was gone
[2/13/18, 10:39:20 AM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm hearing a different story
[2/13/18, 10:39:20 AM] Launchpad: already containing falsities
[2/13/18, 10:39:40 AM] Launchpad: and she bled cause I have a monster dong and sometimes that happens
[2/13/18, 10:40:02 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/13/18, 10:40:19 AM] Launchpad: and also you already know steves a hater
[2/13/18, 10:40:21 AM] Brian Katz: Probably because she was on her period
[2/13/18, 10:40:31 AM] Brian Katz: But not a liar
[2/13/18, 10:40:39 AM] Launchpad: I bring them early
[2/13/18, 10:41:00 AM] Launchpad: he lied about her not leaving during the draft
[2/13/18, 10:41:15 AM] Launchpad: "she wouldn't leave during our draft"
[2/13/18, 10:41:39 AM] Launchpad: Hey does anyone remember some random girl hanging out during our draft? No? Oh wait, it didn't happen
[2/13/18, 10:42:18 AM] Kiyoon: she did leave before the draft
[2/13/18, 10:42:31 AM] Launchpad: well before the draft
[2/13/18, 10:42:42 AM] Launchpad: we got breakfast and she never came back upstairs
[2/13/18, 10:43:21 AM] Kiyoon: pretty gentlemanly of you to get breakfast with her
[2/13/18, 10:43:30 AM] Brian Katz: Steve‚Äôs not a 100% on the where about dog this women during the draft. He does believe her to be locked away in your room, bleeding all over your sheets.
[2/13/18, 10:43:31 AM] Launchpad: i was hungry
[2/13/18, 10:43:57 AM] Brian Katz: About‚Äôs of*
[2/13/18, 10:44:01 AM] Launchpad: sounds like his whole story is no longer credible
[2/13/18, 10:44:57 AM] Kiyoon: we'll just go with the running average of 3.375
[2/13/18, 10:45:03 AM] Launchpad: lol
[2/13/18, 10:45:09 AM] Brian Katz: What about Sean‚Äôs estimation of this women? That has to be taken into account.
[2/13/18, 10:45:19 AM] Kiyoon: thats in there
[2/13/18, 10:45:30 AM] Kiyoon: however....Scotty was the only one that got laid that weekend
[2/13/18, 10:45:32 AM] Kiyoon: so boom
[2/13/18, 10:45:43 AM] Brian Katz: How many of you were single?
[2/13/18, 10:45:47 AM] Launchpad: üôå
[2/13/18, 10:46:01 AM] Kiyoon: I think Steve and Watts
[2/13/18, 10:46:13 AM] Kiyoon: and Sean
[2/13/18, 10:46:14 AM] Launchpad: not only that, first girl I banged after a 6+ relationship
[2/13/18, 10:46:25 AM] Kiyoon: well actually Sean banged too, I think
[2/13/18, 10:46:27 AM] Brian Katz: Steve did spend one whole night taking care of Kiyoon
[2/13/18, 10:46:38 AM] Kiyoon: this is also a true statement
[2/13/18, 10:47:01 AM] Brian Katz: Steve should be taken out if the equation
[2/13/18, 10:47:06 AM] Kiyoon: surprised he wasnt hitting on the nurses at the hospital
[2/13/18, 10:47:07 AM] Brian Katz: Sean got his
[2/13/18, 10:47:20 AM] Brian Katz: So rally Watts was the only fail? What happened?
[2/13/18, 10:47:24 AM] Kiyoon: Steve was in love with the bottle service girl
[2/13/18, 10:47:25 AM] Launchpad: within half an hour of getting to the apt
[2/13/18, 10:47:40 AM] Launchpad: fools gold
[2/13/18, 10:47:52 AM] Kiyoon: hahah exactly
[2/13/18, 10:47:55 AM] Kiyoon: she was pretty hot though
[2/13/18, 10:47:58 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs how Sean rolls then lol. Gets it out of the early so he could chill.
[2/13/18, 10:48:30 AM] Launchpad: lol its a good strategy
[2/13/18, 10:48:47 AM] Brian Katz: I see no holes in it.
[2/13/18, 10:53:34 AM] Dan Watts: I was dating this Colombian chick at the time and even though we weren't exclusive I was not motivated as usual
[2/13/18, 10:55:11 AM] Launchpad: and I ditched the bitch I was recently seeing so now I am regaining my motivation
[2/13/18, 10:57:58 AM] Miller: so you admit you had a gf
[2/13/18, 10:58:20 AM] Launchpad: no i was just demotivated
[2/13/18, 10:58:30 AM] Launchpad: to bang other girls on the side
[2/13/18, 11:00:35 AM] Scott: Got bagels.
[2/13/18, 11:01:01 AM] Launchpad: we sad down and ate breakfast
[2/13/18, 11:01:08 AM] Launchpad: **sat
[2/13/18, 11:01:20 AM] Donk: sad because she was a 4?
[2/13/18, 11:01:43 AM] Launchpad: lol I knew someone was going to call that out
[2/13/18, 11:01:54 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/13/18, 11:03:10 AM] Launchpad: please
[2/13/18, 11:03:17 AM] Launchpad: another married guy
[2/13/18, 11:03:30 AM] Brian Katz: He wasn‚Äôt married at that time
[2/13/18, 11:04:14 AM] Brian Katz: Can anyone besides Scotty verify anything above a 3 for this girl?
[2/13/18, 11:05:10 AM] Brian Katz: You have Sean, Fienberg, and Steve all sayyng the same thing.
[2/13/18, 11:05:26 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/13/18, 11:07:32 AM] Brian Katz: Herman will plead the fif apparently lol
[2/13/18, 11:08:02 AM] Justin: we gotta stop harping back to two years ago. Fberg's wedding watts banged a girl in lp's room and locked him out. I believe that is far more savage.
[2/13/18, 11:08:05 AM] Miller: my testimony has been stricken from the record
[2/13/18, 11:08:17 AM] Justin: And much more prevalent
[2/13/18, 11:08:56 AM] Brian Katz: This all goes back to my meme Herman. Scotty says it doesn‚Äôt apply
[2/13/18, 11:09:10 AM] Brian Katz: So I brought up the Montreal incident
[2/13/18, 11:09:29 AM] Kiyoon: Who did Watts bang at Feinbergs wedding
[2/13/18, 11:09:33 AM] Kiyoon: and where di yuo sleep LP??
[2/13/18, 11:09:42 AM] Brian Katz: At the foot of the bed
[2/13/18, 11:10:34 AM] Justin: Think miller couldn't sleep over sound of lp crying in hallway and let him in his room
[2/13/18, 11:12:53 AM] Launchpad: not quite
[2/13/18, 11:16:40 AM] Launchpad: and I told him he could use the room cause im a good friend like that

[2/14/18, 11:12:10 AM] Launchpad: You think you could just read a book and be successful at shooting free throws? Only the privileged few, born with elite free throw shooting ability, can ever shoot free throws the way free throws were meant to be thrown
[2/14/18, 11:12:42 AM] Brian Katz: Lol trolling Herman with a free throw book
[2/14/18, 11:14:38 AM] Justin: lol ok how long you wnat to read that before you bet me a bitcoin that you cant shoot 70% free throws
[2/14/18, 11:15:10 AM] Justin: ill give you as long as you need to read it at a 4th grade reading level
[2/14/18, 11:16:09 AM] Miller: i honestly believe w/3-6mo of practice and reading that book anyone in this chat could shoot 70% FTs
[2/14/18, 11:16:43 AM] Justin: 69% in college basketball, so i doubt it
[2/14/18, 11:17:00 AM] Launchpad: did they read the book?
[2/14/18, 11:17:08 AM] Justin: well played
[2/14/18, 11:17:10 AM] Miller: are FTs in practice the same as a game?
[2/14/18, 11:17:12 AM] Miller: is there pressure?
[2/14/18, 11:17:17 AM] Miller: are they tired?
[2/14/18, 11:17:43 AM] Donk: i doubt 50% of us would end up hitting that many
[2/14/18, 11:17:55 AM] Miller: well you wont b/c you wont do what i  said
[2/14/18, 11:18:01 AM] Miller: but there is nothing stopping you
[2/14/18, 11:18:20 AM] Miller: if you learn the motion and practice it, it is really not hards
[2/14/18, 11:18:34 AM] Miller: just muscle memory and repetition
[2/14/18, 11:18:58 AM] Kiyoon: the repetition and muscle memory would take years
[2/14/18, 11:19:06 AM] Miller: lol gtfo here
[2/14/18, 11:19:21 AM] Miller: if you want to set the world record of shooting 2300 FTs in a row then sure
[2/14/18, 11:19:38 AM] Miller: shooting 70% in a gym w/nobody around does not take years of practice
[2/14/18, 11:19:41 AM] Kiyoon: so how long do you think it would take Scotty to get to 70%?
[2/14/18, 11:19:46 AM] Miller: i said 3-6mo
[2/14/18, 11:19:52 AM] Kiyoon: no shot
[2/14/18, 11:20:00 AM] Miller: well its impossible to find out
[2/14/18, 11:20:10 AM] Kiyoon: Scotty do this for us so we can make a bet
[2/14/18, 11:20:20 AM] Miller: if he learned the proper form/technique and then shot 100 FTs a day absolutely doable
[2/14/18, 11:20:39 AM] Kiyoon: and I think that would take a couple of years
[2/14/18, 11:20:49 AM] Miller: lol you vastly over-estimate how difficult shooting a FT is
[2/14/18, 11:21:12 AM] Kiyoon: I dont event hink you can shoot 70% in 3 months
[2/14/18, 11:21:17 AM] Kiyoon: after reading that book
[2/14/18, 11:21:31 AM] Miller: if i had a place to practice and time to practice i easily could
[2/14/18, 11:21:39 AM] Miller: i could probably roll out of bed and shoot 60%
[2/14/18, 11:22:13 AM] Kiyoon: yeah man, and people that play basketball on the reg takes a year to go up 10%
[2/14/18, 11:23:18 AM] Miller: im not talking about hitting a 7-10 split or driving a golf ball 300yds, there is nothing stopping anyone w/some practice to be as good as they want at shooting FTs
[2/14/18, 11:23:35 AM] Miller: theres tons of middle and HS kids who can shoot 85%+
[2/14/18, 11:23:46 AM] Miller: im sure some of the girls @15165329107 coached could
[2/14/18, 11:24:55 AM] Launchpad: my brother hit a 7-10 split last week
[2/14/18, 11:25:18 AM] Miller: I can give some advice as to what I did to improve my free throws and how that may help in your quest for 100 consecutive. Just to give you a measure, I left high school shooting 27% from the free throw line. Yes, you read correctly, 27%. I'm 6'5" and played center while in high school.

After being recruited, my future college coach told me that if I wanted to play my freshman year I needed to get that above 65%. By the time my freshman season started I was shooting 84% (from preseason averages) and would regularly shoot over 90% when shooting 100 FT at the end of practice.

My method:

Main thing I needed to change was to stop treating my free throw shot as "unique" from my other shooting attempts during the game. Instead, I shot my FTs just like I shoot my jumpers in a game. For me that was simply one dribble and shoot.
When practicing FTs I always made sure to do them after doing some other drill, be that running, shooting, dribbling, etc. That way you get used to shooting FTs when your legs are tired, arms are tired, mind is tired, or anything of the sort.
While practicing, every FT must be as if its the first meaning, don't make one FT and then just keep your legs stationary while someone passes you back the ball. Re-set every single time so that you get used to having to find your optimum set up.
Fix your form! This will not only help you shoot FTs but will also help your jumper. Add arc to your shot; that's probably the best thing most can do for their game - simply improve the chance the ball will go through the basket. The higher the arc, the larger the area the ball must be within in order to go through the hoop...physics.
Spread your fingers out as much as you can. I had a bad habit of keeping my fingers really close together which didn't give me much control of the ball. Spread fingers also force your hand to "flick" your wrist better in turn leading to better ball rotation on the shot.
Don't forget about the basics: bend legs, hands in cookie jar, etc.
So how will this help with consecutive FT makes? Muscle memory and stamina. I'm out of college now and haven't practice free throws in god knows how long yet I continue to shoot a high percentage whenever I play any sort of league. After reading your post (yesterday) I went to the gym and shot 100 FTs to see how I would fare: 92/100. I didn't keep track of how many in a row (I missed my first 3) but I'm fairly certain I was over 40 in a row before my last miss which ironically enough was at the hundredth FT (lack of focus I guess).
[2/14/18, 11:25:24 AM] Kiyoon: right but thats the whole point, if you don't have solid form its not easy to break out of it
[2/14/18, 11:25:31 AM] Kiyoon: you're talking about changing your entire shot
[2/14/18, 11:25:39 AM] Miller: wow this completely random un-known became a 90% FT shooter
[2/14/18, 11:25:40 AM] Miller: amazing
[2/14/18, 11:25:57 AM] Miller: but youre talking about people who have no form or shots
[2/14/18, 11:26:04 AM] Miller: so there is nothing to un-learn
[2/14/18, 11:26:07 AM] Miller: this is not markelle fultz
[2/14/18, 11:26:17 AM] Brian Katz: But there is pressure. I‚Äôll be standing there recording the rest
[2/14/18, 11:26:41 AM] Kiyoon: wow so you took one random completely unknown shooter and applied it to the rest of the population
[2/14/18, 11:26:43 AM] Brian Katz: Results
[2/14/18, 11:27:16 AM] Miller: make it worth my time kiyoon, 10k says i can shoot 70% plus by year end on 100 FTs
[2/14/18, 11:27:49 AM] Kiyoon: yeah unfortunately i don't have 10K lying around
[2/14/18, 11:27:52 AM] Brian Katz: Damn make the bet
[2/14/18, 11:28:09 AM] Kiyoon: #privledge
[2/14/18, 11:28:14 AM] Kiyoon: totally butchered that
[2/14/18, 11:28:14 AM] Miller: gonna get all that sweet wedding cash
[2/14/18, 11:28:22 AM] Kiyoon: haha this is true...
[2/14/18, 11:28:24 AM] Brian Katz: Avenge your ankle Kiyoon!! Take millers $$$
[2/14/18, 11:30:06 AM] Kiyoon: and I gave you 3 months, not years end
[2/14/18, 11:30:19 AM] Brian Katz: Do it Kiyoon
[2/14/18, 11:30:28 AM] Kiyoon: $20 bucks Miller, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT
[2/14/18, 11:30:41 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z23phgx6y1U lmao this nerd hit $5200 in a row and you dont think you can shoot 70%
[2/14/18, 11:30:51 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs only 9,980 less than he suggested
[2/14/18, 11:31:04 AM] Launchpad: so much hating on the idea of self improvement
[2/14/18, 11:31:27 AM] Kiyoon: i'm not hating on self improvement I think it will take a decent amount of time
[2/14/18, 11:31:28 AM] Launchpad: Corallary: We will all die the same exact loser we were born
[2/14/18, 11:31:29 AM] Kiyoon: not 3 months
[2/14/18, 11:31:41 AM] Miller: i could do it in 3mo
[2/14/18, 11:31:52 AM] Miller: but for someone who has not played in the past i would say maybe 6mo
[2/14/18, 11:32:48 AM] Launchpad: What happens if I follow all the suggestions in the book but after 3-6 months I go from 30% to 60%. Is that considered a failed experiment?
[2/14/18, 11:33:24 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzYh4CGAbCU lol this 60 y/o nerd hits 209 3s in a row
[2/14/18, 11:33:47 AM] Miller: its not like okay ill give you 6mo to dunk
[2/14/18, 11:33:50 AM] Miller: clearly that is not happening
[2/14/18, 11:34:21 AM] Miller: shooting in a practice no pressure environment is just a mechanical repeatable motion, anyone can learn it or improve w/practice
[2/14/18, 11:34:30 AM] Donk: his name is Fred "Free Throw" Newman, you dont get that nickname by being an average shooter
[2/14/18, 11:34:34 AM] Donk: except in this case there would be pressure
[2/14/18, 11:34:41 AM] Donk: to hit the 70% and win the cash
[2/14/18, 11:35:01 AM] Donk: you dont think LP is going to be sweating bullets shooting ft's with 10k on the line?
[2/14/18, 11:35:26 AM] Brian Katz: I agree with you Scotty. You  can accomplish any goal you set for yourself, as long as you put the work in.
[2/14/18, 11:35:50 AM] Miller: well my original statement had nothing to do w/a bet or $
[2/14/18, 11:35:51 AM] Donk: i mean, that is fundamentally untrue
[2/14/18, 11:36:04 AM] Miller: yea neither of you are dunking a basketball
[2/14/18, 11:36:10 AM] Donk: you can set a goal of winning a superbowl, and no matter what you do at this point, its not happening
[2/14/18, 11:36:10 AM] Miller: no matter how many jumpsoles you buy
[2/14/18, 11:40:27 AM] Brian Katz: Not true, I be a part of the team in a different capacity.
[2/14/18, 11:41:41 AM] Brian Katz: I can‚Äôt improve my vertical?
[2/14/18, 11:41:57 AM] Miller: not by enough to dunk, no
[2/14/18, 11:42:14 AM] Donk: fine, you can set a goal to be a starting superbowl winning qb
[2/14/18, 11:42:17 AM] Donk: you happy now ckatz?
[2/14/18, 11:43:53 AM] Miller: and unlike any of those things that are made impossible by genetics, bring good-great at shooting FTs is accessible to anyone
[2/14/18, 11:44:37 AM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs a much more attainable goal for sure.
[2/14/18, 11:46:18 AM] Brian Katz: Lots of other factors in become a super bowl winning qb. Like Trent dilfer is one but Dan Marino isn‚Äôt.
[2/14/18, 11:46:22 AM] Kiyoon: to a degree yes but it doesn't take 3-6 months
[2/14/18, 11:46:36 AM] Kiyoon: let me ask, back in HS, since there are so many 85% FT shooters
[2/14/18, 11:46:39 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs more of a team girl
[2/14/18, 11:46:43 AM] Brian Katz: Goal*
[2/14/18, 11:46:58 AM] Kiyoon: at the end of the practice we all always shot 20 free throws
[2/14/18, 11:47:20 AM] Kiyoon: none of us frmo the beginning of the season improved by more than like 5%
[2/14/18, 11:47:21 AM] Kiyoon: why is that?
[2/14/18, 11:47:57 AM] Kiyoon: and thats not the only time we shot free throws, we'd randomly have drills
[2/14/18, 11:48:26 AM] Miller: bad form or technique? tired from practice? lack of caring or effort? impossibly bad genetics?
[2/14/18, 11:48:27 AM] Miller: who can say
[2/14/18, 11:49:00 AM] Kiyoon: so why wouldnt you apply that to you
[2/14/18, 11:49:28 AM] Kiyoon: Millers got the best genetics there is
[2/14/18, 11:49:33 AM] Kiyoon: THE BEST
[2/14/18, 11:50:23 AM] Miller: solidly average genetics
[2/14/18, 11:50:31 AM] Miller: but even w/bad genetics you can be a 70% FT shooter
[2/14/18, 11:50:44 AM] Miller: you would need impossibly bad genetics to not be able to get good at shooting FTs
[2/14/18, 11:51:03 AM] Miller: are you missing your hands? that would make things more difficult
[2/14/18, 11:53:26 AM] Launchpad: I think even with bad genetics you can still get laid. We should have @16102201963 read the Mystery Method and send him out into the world
[2/14/18, 11:54:02 AM] Scott: @16195657200 i'm doing completely fine getting laid.  i peacock with the best of them.
[2/14/18, 11:54:16 AM] Launchpad: ü§£
[2/14/18, 11:56:43 AM] Miller: @16313981203 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFF6_5hyokU a buzzfeed writer who shoots 37% w/1mo of training shoots 70%+
[2/14/18, 11:57:06 AM] Miller: amazing, incredible, impossible? maybe
[2/14/18, 11:57:40 AM] Miller: is this a hoax? elaborate video editing? did he get steph curry to wear a human mrs doubtfire suit of him for the cameras to fake it? who can say
[2/14/18, 12:01:23 PM] Kiyoon: so he went from 37/100 to 50/100 in 1 day?
[2/14/18, 12:01:27 PM] Kiyoon: seems like a pretty terible baseline
[2/14/18, 12:05:52 PM] Miller: you think going from 37 to 50 is some huge jump?
[2/14/18, 12:06:47 PM] Miller: damnit he's onto us, he found out you are actually play for the chinese national team and just pretended to be bad and pretended to work at buzzfeed to make this video so i could use it, abort mission
[2/14/18, 12:06:56 PM] Miller: wrong chat
[2/14/18, 12:06:57 PM] Miller: disregard
[2/14/18, 12:42:46 PM] Donk: uncovered some fraud today at one of our clients, that was a fun convo telling them that they had about 15k stolen
[2/14/18, 12:43:11 PM] Miller: insurance cover that?
[2/14/18, 12:43:28 PM] Miller: kiyoon almost had 10k stolen
[2/14/18, 12:43:45 PM] Donk: well, it was their office person who was processing their payroll putting through fake expense reimbursements over the last two years
[2/14/18, 12:44:09 PM] Donk: and to be fair, the exec director probalby should have been reviewing the payroll reports over that time period and clearly hadnt been
[2/14/18, 12:44:45 PM] Donk: i dont know what they are going to to do, likely they try to recoup the money from her first before pressing charges
[2/14/18, 1:07:30 PM] Justin: briefly dated a girl who worked at some non for profit, similar situation. Except some women had laundered couple hundred thousand disappeared and the girl that exposed her got acid thrown in her face a week after.
[2/14/18, 1:09:26 PM] Miller: was this in europe?
[2/14/18, 1:09:56 PM] Justin: Lol nah here
[2/14/18, 1:10:12 PM] Miller: damn didnt know we had acid attacks here
[2/14/18, 1:10:25 PM] Brian Katz: You‚Äôre thinking of Batman. That‚Äôs two-face‚Äôs origin.
[2/14/18, 1:10:28 PM] Justin: Had literally just happened at the time
[2/14/18, 1:10:30 PM] Justin: Lol

[2/14/18, 1:49:00 PM] Miller: finished dark, my new biggest complaint was i got super confused who everyone was towards the end
[2/14/18, 1:49:38 PM] Miller: it was good, i didnt like it as much as herman did
[2/14/18, 1:49:40 PM] Donk: that was probably the toughest part of the show
[2/14/18, 1:49:57 PM] Donk: i agree with hermans enthusiasm, i really liked it
[2/14/18, 1:50:38 PM] Donk: did you watch it alone? i found wathcing it with liz helped on that front to have another pair of eyes trying to remember who was who
[2/14/18, 1:52:38 PM] Miller: i did watch it alone
[2/14/18, 1:52:53 PM] Miller: i wish it had like that amazon fire feature where it lists the characters on screen
[2/14/18, 1:53:40 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/14/18, 1:53:45 PM] Miller: would have been very helpful for a show like this
[2/14/18, 1:54:59 PM] Donk: true, that would have been nice
[2/14/18, 1:56:43 PM] Miller: somewhat spoilers so dont click if you dont want to see it but for herman/donk - this was the best line in the show https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/24/24-dark-finale-1.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg
[2/14/18, 1:56:55 PM] Miller: also captures my confusion
[2/14/18, 1:57:24 PM] Donk: ha, yeah, i kept yelling something simliar at him for episodes
[2/14/18, 1:59:00 PM] Donk: at one point i also remember thinking how white the show was, and then i remembered that germany is like 99% white people
[2/14/18, 1:59:21 PM] Brian Katz: That would have helped with game of thrones

[2/14/18, 10:00:37 PM] Justin: I mean my professor in class today wasnt showing us her project where they are scraping twitter accounts to detect fraud.
[2/14/18, 10:01:04 PM] Justin: In literally the snap program. But hey, I guess government is incapable of detecting fraud.
[2/14/18, 10:04:12 PM] Justin: Also ...
[2/14/18, 10:04:40 PM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/14/18, 10:06:17 PM] Justin: So yeh I suppose if you have never actually read anything about the program and the fraud rate it's interesting. Good starting place would be this podcast https://m.soundcloud.com/citationsneeded/episode-26-the-welfare-dog

[2/15/18, 8:38:28 AM] Miller: https://twitter.com/brendankoerner/status/915205018088853504 i found this twitter thread interesting
[2/15/18, 8:38:35 AM] Miller: On February 14, 1969 there had already been 11 planes hijackings that year.
By the end of the year, the number was something like 82.
[2/15/18, 8:38:42 AM] Miller: This was considered an impossible problem to solve. There was simply no way to prevent a person from walking onto a plane with a gun and hijacking it.
[2/15/18, 9:27:41 AM] Brian Katz: To be fair, that didn‚Äôt solve plane hijackings.
[2/15/18, 9:28:56 AM] Donk: speaking of plane hijackings, this movie is dope: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Thunderbolt_(film)
[2/15/18, 9:29:59 AM] Donk: its based on a true story of plane heading to israel that got hijacked, and the ensuing israeli rescue operation
[2/15/18, 9:30:39 AM] Miller: there has been like 3 in the last 30 years, a far cry from 80/yr
[2/15/18, 9:31:27 AM] Miller: i think if we could reduce mass shootings from 100+/yr to 1 every 10 years we would all consider that a win
[2/15/18, 9:32:23 AM] Donk: ive pretty much resigned myself to realizing that this not getting fixed anytime soon
[2/15/18, 9:32:32 AM] Donk: certainly not with a republican president/senate/house
[2/15/18, 9:32:43 AM] Donk: and even if it was democratic, still unlikely
[2/15/18, 9:32:47 AM] Brian Katz: True
[2/15/18, 9:33:02 AM] Miller: of course, but just thought the parallel was interesting, i had no idea hijackings were ever that big of a problem
[2/15/18, 9:33:13 AM] Miller: and it is a good retort to the "there is nothing we can do" crowd
[2/15/18, 9:33:21 AM] Donk: thats true
[2/15/18, 9:34:06 AM] Miller: and just shows its always all about $, as soon as it became a financial problem for the airlines they figured out a way to fix it real quick
[2/15/18, 9:34:34 AM] Launchpad: https://patriot1tech.com
[2/15/18, 9:34:47 AM] Donk: the ironic part is that these shootings likely make money vs cost money
[2/15/18, 9:34:59 AM] Donk: shooting happens, people clamor for gun control, more guns are sold
[2/15/18, 9:35:26 AM] Launchpad: Technology -> better gun detection
[2/15/18, 9:35:27 AM] Miller: but yes sadly nothing is going to get done, we are all numb to this b/c by next week this will be forgotten and there will be another shooting somewhere, cant imagine why any one would spur any change at this point if the last 40-50 havent
[2/15/18, 9:35:30 AM] Miller: eat arbys
[2/15/18, 9:35:48 AM] Donk: on a side note, the gun industry has tanked since trump became president - without people worrying that obama was goignt ot take their guns away, sales dropped considerably when he was elected
[2/15/18, 9:36:11 AM] Miller: im sure the stocks also ran up into the election on the assumption HRC was going to win
[2/15/18, 9:37:30 AM] Launchpad: You can vote with your dollars to capitalize companies that are working on the latest technology for detecting weapons
[2/15/18, 9:37:34 AM] Launchpad: https://patriot1tech.com
[2/15/18, 9:37:59 AM] Miller: concealed weapons are not really a problem
[2/15/18, 9:38:11 AM] Miller: nobody is concealing an AR15
[2/15/18, 9:38:51 AM] Launchpad: Vegas shooter
[2/15/18, 9:39:04 AM] Miller: you dont need technology, you just need to find ways to make it less accessible in general and not accessible for people w/any kinds of red flags
[2/15/18, 9:39:16 AM] Miller: if the entire country had gun laws like NY would be a good start
[2/15/18, 9:39:39 AM] Brian Katz: I just don‚Äôt get the appeal of these school shootings? Like why walk into a school and start to blow everyone away? That kid was 19 had his whole life ahead of him. Instead he decided to end 17 other lives, wound many others, and destroy his own.
[2/15/18, 9:39:49 AM] Miller: mental illness
[2/15/18, 9:40:11 AM] Miller: without having mental illness you or i can't understand the rationale behind it
[2/15/18, 9:40:37 AM] Brian Katz: Maybe it‚Äôs the tide pods?
[2/15/18, 9:41:01 AM] Miller: wish that kid had eaten a few tide pods first
[2/15/18, 9:44:15 AM] Miller: https://twitter.com/BryanDawsonUSA/status/963906669242658816 this guy lays out a bunch of logical/reasonable steps could take that would at least seem like a good start

[2/15/18, 9:48:53 AM] Brian Katz: Holy shit, that two year old blew away his mom?
[2/15/18, 9:49:32 AM] Miller: toddlers shooting adults/themselves sadly not that uncommon
[2/15/18, 9:49:41 AM] Brian Katz: Really?
[2/15/18, 9:49:45 AM] Miller: they dont know what they are doing and tons of idiots leave loaded guns around
[2/15/18, 9:50:40 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs just insane. I have guns at my crib, and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable just having them lying around. Especially if they were loaded.
[2/15/18, 9:51:45 AM] Miller: Each day in the United States, an average of 3.5 people under the age of 18 are shot to death and another 15.5 are treated in a hospital emergency department for a gunshot wound. Between 2012 and 2014, an average of 1,287 children and adolescents died each year as a result of gun violence, making firearms second only to motor vehicle crashes as a cause of injury-related deaths. Another 5,790 were treated for gunshot injuries in U.S. hospitals.

Here's another way to look at it: In the United States, a gun is the cause of death in more than 1 in 10 deaths of people under the age of 18.
[2/15/18, 9:52:24 AM] Miller: Among children under 12, 150 are killed with guns each year and another 279 are treated in hospital emergency rooms for non-fatal injuries
[2/15/18, 9:53:09 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/15/18, 9:53:16 AM] Miller: and thats toddlers shooting adults
[2/15/18, 9:53:41 AM] Miller: ~1x/week on avg
[2/15/18, 9:53:45 AM] Miller: over last few years
[2/15/18, 9:59:47 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/15/18, 10:03:58 AM] Kiyoon: I actually have heard that
[2/15/18, 10:04:10 AM] Miller: cardio makes you fat? lol
[2/15/18, 10:04:10 AM] Miller: okay
[2/15/18, 10:04:19 AM] Kiyoon: not necessarily fat, it somehow decreases your ability to burn fat
[2/15/18, 10:04:24 AM] Miller: ive heard its impossible to get better at shooting FTs
[2/15/18, 10:04:34 AM] Miller: you need to start taking into account the sources of your informations
[2/15/18, 10:04:49 AM] Kiyoon: It was from a personal trainer
[2/15/18, 10:05:05 AM] Kiyoon: I mean I didn't believe her
[2/15/18, 10:05:05 AM] Kiyoon: lol
[2/15/18, 10:05:08 AM] Miller: hold on gimmie 5 minutes on the internet and ill be a personal trainer also
[2/15/18, 10:05:17 AM] Miller: im also a certified nutritionist btw
[2/15/18, 10:05:23 AM] Kiyoon: you are not
[2/15/18, 10:05:35 AM] Miller: i am considering there is no such thing as a certified nutritionist
[2/15/18, 10:05:56 AM] Miller: cardio burns calories, less calories less fat, less = more visible abs
[2/15/18, 10:06:03 AM] Miller: therefore cardio does in fact lead to abs
[2/15/18, 10:07:11 AM] Miller: (not the most efficient or remotely the best course of action but i would not buy anything or listen to anyone telling you it makes you fatter)
[2/15/18, 10:12:21 AM] Launchpad: Excessive cardio ends up burning burns muscle
[2/15/18, 10:12:46 AM] Launchpad: I would not say it makes you 'fatter' but it does distract from the goal of cutting
[2/15/18, 10:13:17 AM] Launchpad: marathon runners are not cut
[2/15/18, 10:13:17 AM] Miller: any kind of excessive caloric deficit is going to burn muscle
[2/15/18, 10:13:41 AM] Miller: generically saying cardio makes you fat is incredibly misleading and stupdid
[2/15/18, 10:14:33 AM] Launchpad: yeah I wouldn't say that
[2/15/18, 10:15:11 AM] Miller: bc you are not trying to sell a supplement w/clickbait

[2/15/18, 10:17:04 AM] Miller: i would say steve is not going to change his team name to that
[2/15/18, 10:17:28 AM] Miller: considering his like 8-1 record post-name change this season my guess is he sticks w/this one
[2/15/18, 10:21:51 AM] Launchpad: and he actually has a good name already
[2/15/18, 10:21:50 AM] Launchpad: lol
[2/15/18, 10:22:41 AM] Miller: my only complaint is i just realized yesterday it is donk*y*marius not donkmarius
[2/15/18, 10:22:46 AM] Miller: why is he adding a y in there
[2/15/18, 10:23:05 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/15/18, 10:34:47 AM] Donk: because of the y in demaryius, but yeah, doesnt make sense when you say it outloud
[2/15/18, 10:35:43 AM] Launchpad: donky lips
[2/15/18, 10:35:48 AM] Miller: but the y in demaryius comes at the end, after the R, if he named it donkmaryius i would be fine w/that
[2/15/18, 10:37:50 AM] Donk: its still better than cookin the competition so there is that
[2/15/18, 10:38:21 AM] Launchpad: Alvin and the Equipmunks better than that
[2/15/18, 10:47:33 AM] Justin: just a little aside excessive cardio doesnt end up burning muscle excessive long distance cardio does
[2/15/18, 10:48:05 AM] Justin: and as usual everything miller said
[2/15/18, 10:48:33 AM] Miller: excessive cardio could lead to excessive caloric deficit which is going to burn muscle
[2/15/18, 10:48:49 AM] Miller: granted not "easy" to burn 3-4k calories/day from cardio
[2/15/18, 10:48:50 AM] Justin: excessive lifting weights can lead to that as well
[2/15/18, 10:49:01 AM] Justin: so tis relative
[2/15/18, 10:49:08 AM] Miller: excessive anything that leads to a big caloric deficit
[2/15/18, 10:50:08 AM] Justin: so sprinting 20x 100 feet a day everyday is probably excessive, but will probbaly help you gain muscle
[2/15/18, 10:50:39 AM] Miller: too many variables
[2/15/18, 10:50:50 AM] Miller: if you arent eating you are going to be losing muscle
[2/15/18, 10:50:55 AM] Justin: fair
[2/15/18, 10:51:07 AM] Miller: if you are running a 500 calorie deficit and spring 20x a day you are finer
[2/15/18, 10:52:35 AM] Justin: https://www.t-nation.com/training/sprinting-for-muscle
[2/15/18, 10:53:01 AM] Justin: seems pretty tied to lifting in order to really work to delveop muscle
[2/15/18, 10:53:03 AM] Donk: is T-nation the offical site for T-levels?
[2/15/18, 10:53:28 AM] Justin: followed by brazilliannuts.com
[2/15/18, 10:53:33 AM] Justin: dont go there
[2/15/18, 10:54:27 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/15/18, 11:03:13 AM] Launchpad: its not rocket science - lifting weights raises T levels
[2/15/18, 11:08:52 AM] Justin: No it's not rocket science it's just bio mechanical science.
[2/15/18, 11:09:28 AM] Justin: A science literally 99% of people don't understand, so actually pretty similar to rocket science in that regard.

[2/15/18, 11:16:03 AM] Justin: Lol

[2/15/18, 11:26:36 AM] Justin: I mean if you want to ignore the entire premise and thesis, sure
[2/15/18, 11:28:02 AM] Justin: unless when you meant bio-mechanical science is easy lifting weights increases your t levels which have no effect on muscle growth, so thats why i bring up t levels
[2/15/18, 11:28:45 AM] Justin: makes you sweat as well, is your goal to sweat?
[2/15/18, 11:29:54 AM] Launchpad: to have lots and lots of sex

[2/15/18, 11:38:19 AM] Donk: you know that i have watched entourage too many times when i know not just exactly what you are talking about, but when he is walking angrily away, that chain hang low song is playing as background music

[2/15/18, 1:48:38 PM] Donk: come on herm, we all know that white people cant be terrorists
[2/15/18, 1:48:43 PM] Donk: they are "mentally sick" and need help
[2/15/18, 1:49:22 PM] Miller: white people stopped being terrorists when they stopped bombing things and started shooting places up

[2/15/18, 2:03:59 PM] Brian Katz: False
[2/15/18, 2:04:25 PM] Brian Katz: Every time you contact me for a trade, it‚Äôs a waste of my time.
[2/15/18, 2:05:21 PM] Brian Katz: No one wants Emmanuel Sanders bro.
[2/15/18, 2:06:41 PM] Scott: thats unfortunate
[2/15/18, 2:06:52 PM] Miller: in addition anytime i contact him for a trade it is also a waste of time
[2/15/18, 2:07:45 PM] Brian Katz: So what you‚Äôre saying is that cheese is a complete waste of time?
[2/15/18, 3:27:19 PM] Justin: I recently had a pleasant cheese trade experience. And he's hungry for more.

[2/15/18, 3:35:57 PM] Justin: Although in fairness I have no idea about her body weight and trolling issues
[2/15/18, 3:36:07 PM] Justin: Thought that was Lena Dunham
[2/15/18, 3:36:30 PM] Miller: idk much about her but my understanding from southpark was like 90% of her comedy revolves around her being "fat"
[2/15/18, 3:36:56 PM] Donk: get over it, women are funny now
[2/15/18, 3:37:33 PM] Launchpad: lol is that what you think ?
[2/15/18, 3:37:43 PM] Donk: i did watch one of her specials, i remember it being funny, but no bit was memorable enough to rember it
[2/15/18, 3:37:44 PM] Launchpad: that I don't find women funny?
[2/15/18, 3:37:49 PM] Donk: no,t hat was the joke from south park lol

[2/15/18, 3:51:47 PM] Scott: 5' w/ heels?
[2/15/18, 3:51:58 PM] Miller: no he has flats on

[2/15/18, 3:53:01 PM] Miller: 5'10
[2/15/18, 3:53:15 PM] Miller: my guess was 6" heels? idk if that is crazy or not
[2/15/18, 3:53:18 PM] Donk: those are some stripper heels then if they are 6in plus
[2/15/18, 3:53:33 PM] Miller: really? figured for celebrity red carpet 6 was "normal"
[2/15/18, 3:53:38 PM] Miller: so maybe she is a couple inches shorter
[2/15/18, 3:54:05 PM] Donk: id say poor bruno, but hes rich and famous, so im sure hes ok with his lack of height
[2/15/18, 3:54:31 PM] Miller: yea i would trade my height for his wealth
[2/15/18, 3:55:37 PM] Launchpad: what if that height included a tiny dong
[2/15/18, 3:55:38 PM] Donk: being that short would suck so much for general admission events/concerts
[2/15/18, 3:55:55 PM] Miller: how tiny we talking?
[2/15/18, 3:56:49 PM] Launchpad: lol i have no idea....something proportional to being 5' tall

[2/15/18, 3:57:17 PM] Miller: well i was trying to figure out if he meant small for a normal person or like micropenis small
[2/15/18, 3:57:26 PM] Miller: b/c the latter is a dealbreaker

[2/15/18, 5:54:25 PM] Miller: not an option anymore w/the kids but in general valentines day was the worst night to go out to eat, so dumb, just go out literally any other night
[2/15/18, 5:54:40 PM] Miller: that is pretty impressive
[2/15/18, 5:54:58 PM] Miller: outside of a digorno or maybe like a dominos medium pizza when i am drunk i dont think i have ever eaten a pizza by myself
[2/15/18, 5:55:13 PM] Launchpad: it was a small & a flatbread, but it was 8 slices
[2/15/18, 5:55:46 PM] Launchpad: probably similar size to dominos medium or large
[2/15/18, 5:56:03 PM] Miller: im convinced dominos is like 80% air

[2/16/18, 2:54:45 PM] Launchpad: _Wall Street's Top CEOs Take Home $126 Million for 2017_

Wall Street CEOs are getting paid the big bucks again.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. said Friday that they gave their CEOs raises for 2017, meaning all five large U.S. banks with significant trading and investment-banking operations have done so.

The chief executives of the banks, which include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., and Morgan Stanley, were paid on average $25.3 million for their work last year, up 17% from 2016, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For the group as a whole, combined total compensation of about $126 million is the highest annual tally since before the financial crisis.

The gains mark the fifth consecutive year in which pay rose for Wall Street's top CEOs. In 2017, the increases reflected stronger profits for banks driven by a growing economy, rising employment, loosening regulations under President Donald Trump and an improving interest-rate backdrop for lending.

[2/21/18, 8:32:21 AM] Donk: man, florida is a fucked up place
[2/21/18, 8:34:01 AM] Donk: so they had a bunch of the students from that school show up to a state senate or legistrator meeting becuase they are going to have a vote on whether or not to have a DISCUSSION on a possible AR-15 and assualt rifle ban, they open with a prayer for the fallen students, and then proceed to vote down having a DISCUSSION 71 to 36 (or something like that)
[2/21/18, 9:04:58 AM] Kiyoon: I think thats just most of America
[2/21/18, 9:11:07 AM] Donk: depending on the state, but a lot of it
[2/21/18, 9:12:50 AM] Donk: but given that this just happened in florida, and that a bunch of the students were there, and they opened with a paryer about it, and then overwhelming vote to not even have a discussion seems particularly florida like to me
[2/21/18, 10:08:47 AM] Miller: https://www.someecards.com/entertainment/celebrities/jay-z-tip-bar-tab
[2/21/18, 10:08:59 AM] Miller: jayz leaves $11k tip for waitress and ppl are mad about it
[2/21/18, 10:09:19 AM] Miller: (also the tip was calculated automatically, as if he is going to come up w/a # like $11,100)
[2/21/18, 10:10:06 AM] Donk: heres the issue with tipping: presumably you are tipping because someone is serving you
[2/21/18, 10:10:22 AM] Donk: but does it take any more work to serve a 1k bottle of champagne than it does a 100.00 bottle?
[2/21/18, 10:10:44 AM] Donk: but one deserves 10 times the tip just because that bottle is more expensive?
[2/21/18, 10:11:22 AM] Miller: which is why, idk for sure b/c i dont drink fancy wine, but i think people "adjust" their tips if they order fancy bottles of wine w/dinner
[2/21/18, 10:11:40 AM] Miller: in the case of a club its just all done automatically so w/e
[2/21/18, 10:12:05 AM] Miller: this might be my favorite line from the article "However, many pointed out that because Jay Z owns Ace of Spades, it is likely that he didn't pay for the bottles and merely just tipped the server."
[2/21/18, 10:12:11 AM] Miller: yea, that is how that works
[2/21/18, 10:12:28 AM] Miller: im gonna buy some shares of arizona iced tea and then just walk into a bodega and take it for free, they will understand
[2/21/18, 10:13:06 AM] Donk: i did have a bodega once try to charge me 1.50 for a can of arizona clearly marked as .99 cents
[2/21/18, 10:13:11 AM] Donk: i was tight
[2/21/18, 10:13:27 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/21/18, 10:14:46 AM] Brian Katz: Did you buy the Arizona at 1.50?
[2/21/18, 10:14:57 AM] Donk: no, i left in protest lol
[2/21/18, 10:15:21 AM] Donk: this was many years ago when i was more principled over 50 cents
[2/21/18, 10:15:41 AM] Miller: rent is expensive, it doesnt make sense why a deli in north dakota should sell something for the same price as nyc
[2/21/18, 10:45:21 AM] Launchpad: theres this pizza place in Yorktown, the owner is a notoriously cheap fuck --> he would sharpie a 1 on the can to make the Arizonas $1.99
[2/21/18, 10:55:18 AM] Donk: see, that i at least can respect
[2/21/18, 10:55:31 AM] Donk: better to mark it with the sharpie, than to pull a surprise at the register
[2/21/18, 10:55:53 AM] Brian Katz: At that point just sell Snapple.

[2/21/18, 11:25:42 AM] Launchpad: no meat cheese
[2/21/18, 11:25:45 AM] Scott: And once again thanks for your inability to resist posting pictures with my ex wife in it
[2/21/18, 11:25:46 AM] Scott: Or I think it is her
[2/21/18, 11:27:32 AM] Miller: i dont think you can be triggered if you cant even tell if it is her
[2/21/18, 11:27:59 AM] Miller: "wow thanks for being considerate and cropping out this woman next to me who may or may not be my ex-wife"

[2/22/18, 7:47:53 AM] Miller: then he starts going into how great a game it was
[2/22/18, 7:48:43 AM] Miller: i quickly cut him off and told him nobody watched it or cares
[2/22/18, 7:49:03 AM] Miller: as americans we do not care about 
1. womens sports
2. hockey
3. the olympics
[2/22/18, 7:49:14 AM] Miller: so combining all 3 of those into 1? lol FOH
[2/22/18, 8:52:34 AM] Brian Katz: Damn, he got double played. You reveled in his misery, and you had no horse in the race.
[2/22/18, 9:29:35 AM] Scott: We watch the summer Olympics
[2/22/18, 9:29:47 AM] Brian Katz: No we don‚Äôt
[2/22/18, 9:31:15 AM] Donk: americans on a whole do watch both the winter and summer olympics
[2/22/18, 9:31:38 AM] Donk: it leads the ratings every night basically
[2/22/18, 9:32:06 AM] Donk: and generally by far at that
[2/22/18, 9:33:12 AM] Miller: its on on for a month and not 1 person has said a word about it in this chat
[2/22/18, 9:33:25 AM] Miller: not 1 of my non-canadian co-workers has said a word about it
[2/22/18, 9:33:27 AM] Donk: its been on for 2 weeks
[2/22/18, 9:33:39 AM] Donk: and ive been watching alot, i talk about it with people at work alot
[2/22/18, 9:35:02 AM] Donk: the other issue with the winter olympics is that most of the good stuff happens in the first week
[2/22/18, 9:35:18 AM] Donk: the second week is mainly figure skating
[2/22/18, 9:36:22 AM] Brian Katz: Apparently Donk watched The Olympics and no one else.
[2/22/18, 9:36:28 AM] Miller: tonya harding was the last memorable us winter olympics moment
[2/22/18, 9:36:40 AM] Miller: and before that it was USA vs Russia hockey
[2/22/18, 9:36:53 AM] Brian Katz: Then the miracle on ice, which none of us were alive for.
[2/22/18, 9:38:12 AM] Kiyoon: I stand with Donk

[2/22/18, 9:44:06 AM] Brian Katz: ESPN?
[2/22/18, 9:46:52 AM] Kiyoon: nbc
[2/22/18, 9:47:09 AM] Scott: About to argue an appeal. Wish me luck. Lol
[2/22/18, 9:48:41 AM] Donk: I mean, the national tv ratings show that people do in fact watch the olympics, thats a real fact not a "people arent talking about it in my office" fact
[2/22/18, 9:53:24 AM] Miller: i have no doubt the same people that drive NCIS, CSI, and the big bang theory to the top of the ratings are now watching the olympics
[2/22/18, 9:54:20 AM] Launchpad: They ‚ô•Ô∏è mens figure skating ‚õ∏
[2/22/18, 10:02:54 AM] Donk: the snowboarding is the best part of the winter olympics - halfpipe and slopestyle
[2/22/18, 10:03:36 AM] Donk: speed skating/skeleton/biathalon/curling all pretty good too
[2/22/18, 10:04:12 AM] Miller: nothing more exhilarating than watching people play shuffleboard on ice
[2/22/18, 10:04:31 AM] Miller: is curling like the gym teacher of olympic sports?
[2/22/18, 10:04:40 AM] Miller: like well i cant skate and i dont have any actual skills sooooo
[2/22/18, 10:14:29 AM] Justin: Worst part about olympics is scripted shows not running new episodes for 3 weeks
[2/22/18, 10:15:05 AM] Justin: Well other than the olympics itself being trash.
[2/22/18, 10:15:55 AM] Donk: Haters going to hate.  I enjoy watching obscure sports for two weeks every 4 years
[2/22/18, 10:17:30 AM] Justin: "Sports"
[2/22/18, 10:17:55 AM] Donk: Well, yes, some should be classified as athletic activities
[2/22/18, 10:17:56 AM] Miller: you dont think skiing 50ft then shooting a rifle for no reason is a sport?
[2/22/18, 10:17:56 AM] Miller: blasphemy

[2/23/18, 6:01:01 PM] Scott: and ahve you rescheduled once before?
[2/23/18, 6:01:25 PM] Miller: I have postponed already and depending on what day it is next week I might have work obligations
[2/23/18, 6:02:00 PM] Scott: you may need to appear, but when you get there, you say why you can't go (creating a better excuse for it then i presume you are coming up with now), and you'll get out
[2/23/18, 6:02:13 PM] Miller: No I literally cannot appear
[2/23/18, 6:02:19 PM] Miller: I have meetings at that time
[2/23/18, 6:02:27 PM] Scott: lol, the court could give a shit about that
[2/23/18, 6:02:41 PM] Scott: if they call you in on monday and you get put in the jury panel
[2/23/18, 6:02:54 PM] Scott: teh attorneys will tell you how long they expect it to be, and will ask if you have any conflicts in that period of time
[2/23/18, 6:02:59 PM] Scott: if you do you say it and they should let you go
[2/23/18, 6:03:04 PM] Miller: Either way I'm not going so the question was do I tell them I can't go or just ignore it
[2/23/18, 6:03:07 PM] Scott: but you should make it sound more "emergency" or "serious" than you are
[2/23/18, 6:03:15 PM] Scott: tell them
[2/23/18, 6:03:18 PM] Miller: K
[2/23/18, 6:03:21 PM] Scott: bad advice from anyone who says to ignore it
[2/23/18, 6:03:54 PM] Scott: tell who is the question...do you have a hotline to call in to in the morning to see if you were selected?
[2/23/18, 6:03:54 PM] Scott: and will that give you a live person/
[2/23/18, 6:03:55 PM] Scott: ?
[2/23/18, 6:04:15 PM] Miller: I have a hot line to call the night before
[2/23/18, 6:04:32 PM] Miller: There's a phone number and email address for them listed if there is an issue I think
[2/23/18, 6:04:48 PM] Miller: So Monday is like 0 to 145
[2/23/18, 6:04:53 PM] Miller: I'm 450
[2/23/18, 6:05:01 PM] Miller: So I'm assuming I will be called Wednesday
[2/23/18, 6:05:24 PM] Miller: Which would be fine but Thursday I have to be at work
[2/23/18, 6:05:51 PM] Scott: you're not in a bad position
[2/23/18, 6:05:56 PM] Scott: b/c in theory they may call you and say we don't need oyu
[2/23/18, 6:06:12 PM] Miller: That would be ideal
[2/23/18, 6:06:38 PM] Scott: depending on (1) if the pools there satisfy the jury's needed to be selected; and/or (2) if cases get adjourned out or there are no more jury pools needed
[2/23/18, 6:07:01 PM] Scott: problem you may have is that jury duty is nearly mandatory in appearance
[2/23/18, 6:07:14 PM] Scott: so getting ahead of it may help, but your excuse may not be availing at all
[2/23/18, 6:07:25 PM] Scott: best case scenario boviously you dont get called or you aren't needed
[2/23/18, 6:07:33 PM] Miller: I mean that's fine, the FBI gonna knock down my door?
[2/23/18, 6:07:47 PM] Miller: I'm not skipping bail on a murder charge
[2/23/18, 6:07:48 PM] Scott: i agree with you, i'm just saying.
[2/23/18, 6:08:08 PM] Miller: What would have happened if I had thrown this letter out accidentally or not gotten it?
[2/23/18, 6:08:17 PM] Miller: Would I be dragged away in handcuffs?
[2/23/18, 6:09:29 PM] Scott: i'm gonna ignore you now.
[2/23/18, 6:10:05 PM] Miller: If I do get in trouble for this I'll just say you're my lawyer and you told me to ignore it
[2/23/18, 6:10:06 PM] Scott: but yes, you asked a question, i told you what's up...and that's all i got on that.
[2/23/18, 6:10:15 PM] Scott: haha

[2/27/18, 3:30:24 PM] Justin: im just googling it now, seems like its being reported both ways
[2/27/18, 3:36:22 PM] Justin: i take issue with the bullshit narrative more, like the fox news segment my friend posted the other day that liberals are offended by the word "man".  As if these same assholes spreading this nonsense, wouldn't be offended/ policing  half the fucken words coming out of my mouth.  Then there is the narrative that somehow being correctly dismissive of these liberal "over-reactionaries" policing language, somehow justifies dismissing the idea that racism is still rampant.  Like "look they wont even let us make cool running jokes.  Liberals think everything is racist, they're so dumb."

[3/2/18, 11:25:58 AM] Dan Watts: Pretty sure I paid 50 euro both times but it may have been 75. They were both thicc but well proportioned
[3/2/18, 11:26:18 AM] Launchpad: lol you def paid $50
[3/2/18, 11:26:37 AM] Launchpad: they were the thick girls thats why they didn't try to upsell you
[3/2/18, 11:27:08 AM] Launchpad: that girl from the first night -- I only had 90 Euros so she took it anyway
[3/2/18, 11:27:10 AM] Dan Watts: They were just happy for the company. I appreciated that. Gratitude gets you a long way
[3/2/18, 11:27:18 AM] Launchpad: lol
[3/2/18, 11:27:59 AM] Launchpad: so I did the math -- at $90 bucks a pop, I could bang that chick once a day for 32,850 euros a year
[3/2/18, 11:28:12 AM] Launchpad: SIGN ME THE FUCK UP
[3/2/18, 11:29:31 AM] Miller: you would spend 60k pretax money to bang a hooker once a day?
[3/2/18, 11:29:32 AM] Miller: wut
[3/2/18, 11:30:02 AM] Launchpad: thats how hot she was
[3/2/18, 11:30:50 AM] Launchpad: only problem is once a day wont be enough
[3/2/18, 11:30:56 AM] Donk: wont pay for 300.00 bottle service, will pay 32k for hookers?
[3/2/18, 11:32:04 AM] Launchpad: 1 share of bottle service == 3 lays with supermodel
[3/2/18, 11:32:28 AM] Miller: bottle service is not $300 per person stop it
[3/2/18, 11:32:42 AM] Launchpad: it was in Vegas
[3/2/18, 11:32:46 AM] Miller: never
[3/2/18, 11:33:04 AM] Miller: and 1 night of bottle service = 4-5 hours
[3/2/18, 11:33:04 AM] Launchpad: when we went for your bachelor party we spent about 300 a night on bottles
[3/2/18, 11:33:07 AM] Miller: hooker = 6-15 min
[3/2/18, 11:33:30 AM] Launchpad: 1 bottle actually costs: $30
[3/2/18, 11:33:37 AM] Miller: banging a chick is actually free
[3/2/18, 11:33:57 AM] Launchpad: so is hanging out in a club once your inside
[3/2/18, 11:34:47 AM] Launchpad: just because you go out it doesn't mean the goal is to get as drunk as possible like a 19 year old
[3/2/18, 11:38:01 AM] Miller: im gonna pull my CC statements to dispute your $300/person claim
[3/2/18, 11:38:14 AM] Miller: but i thought it was $30?
[3/2/18, 11:38:17 AM] Miller: now its free?
[3/2/18, 11:38:46 AM] Launchpad: Ive been to Vegas like 15 times and the most expensive trip by far was the one with 4 nights of bottle service
[3/2/18, 11:39:06 AM] Launchpad: $30 is what the bottle of grey goose costs to the club that they are turning around and selling for $1000
[3/2/18, 11:39:26 AM] Miller: and $0 is what it costs to bang a chick who is turning around and selling it to you for 90 euros

[3/2/18, 11:49:25 AM] Miller: whats that? it didnt happen?
[3/2/18, 11:49:29 AM] Miller: i, for one, am shocked
[3/2/18, 11:49:29 AM] Miller: SHOCKED
[3/2/18, 11:49:43 AM] Miller: oh well, def will happen this weekend for sure
[3/2/18, 11:49:51 AM] Miller: #cheeseday2.0
[3/2/18, 11:54:35 AM] Scott: I have played basketball every week. Katz knows he is invited.
[3/2/18, 11:55:21 AM] Dan Watts: Cheese stays in the streets
[3/2/18, 11:55:35 AM] Dan Watts: Katz knows where to find him
[3/2/18, 11:56:24 AM] Brian Katz: I had a wedding last week, and the week before his gym was closed.

[3/2/18, 1:55:34 PM] Launchpad: I blew a fuse in my car and the charger doesn't work, so I haven't been using my bluetooth device -- I just keep on local radio.  FM Radio hasn't changed one bit -- its like listening to a 67 minute CD on repeat
[3/2/18, 1:56:54 PM] Launchpad: I hear Arcade Fire's Creature Comfort at least once a day
[3/2/18, 1:57:38 PM] Donk: ha
[3/2/18, 1:57:47 PM] Donk: while not the best arcade fire song, its certianly enjoyable
[3/2/18, 1:58:17 PM] Donk: but once a day is actually pretty good repeat wise
[3/2/18, 1:58:24 PM] Launchpad: its catchy -- there are worse things out there
[3/2/18, 1:58:26 PM] Donk: the pop stations only play like 20 songs on repeat all day
[3/2/18, 1:58:50 PM] Donk: but sateltite radio, not much better, all of the stations only have 4 hours worth of songs that just repeat
[3/2/18, 1:59:01 PM] Launchpad: but its like why are they playing this song over and over...did it just come out?? Nope....last summer üò¢
[3/2/18, 1:59:30 PM] Donk: yeah, i do agree that it is strange that that particular song is on the radio all the time now (i hear it a bunch also)
[3/2/18, 1:59:46 PM] Donk: but it wasnt the lead single for the album, so maybe its just catch up
[3/2/18, 1:59:48 PM] Donk: catching up
[3/2/18, 2:00:06 PM] Miller: rockstar by post malone came out in september and is on every channel 900x/a day now
[3/2/18, 2:03:59 PM] Launchpad: who the fuck even listens to FM radio anyway

[3/2/18, 5:58:51 PM] Miller: Been on a train for 90 min already
[3/2/18, 6:09:18 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs not getting fixed. They made my train go back to Jamaica
[3/2/18, 6:09:59 PM] Miller: To be expected, it is raining
[3/2/18, 6:10:43 PM] Brian Katz: A utility pole fell on the tracks at Westbury. They want everyone to get off at Jamaica and take a Babylon train
[3/2/18, 6:12:07 PM] Miller: Seems like a totally reasonable solution
[3/2/18, 6:12:27 PM] Miller: Probably can just walk home from there

[3/2/18, 7:28:23 PM] Launchpad: lol
[3/2/18, 7:28:44 PM] Launchpad: its technically libel because it insinuates that they DID sell AR-15s

[3/2/18, 7:30:35 PM] Miller: Sure email is a good start
[3/2/18, 7:30:39 PM] Dan Watts: Also- jerry Seinfeld is a recognized comedian so the question becomes would a reasonable person think it's a joke
[3/2/18, 7:30:48 PM] Miller: But they could have just quote tweeted him and replied
[3/2/18, 7:30:51 PM] Launchpad: they're already getting replaced with smart contracts
[3/2/18, 7:30:55 PM] Dan Watts: Law is still in the 19th century, it's a joke
[3/2/18, 7:31:06 PM] Miller: That account is not run by Seinfeld
[3/2/18, 7:31:33 PM] Dan Watts: Even worse bc that guy is prob broke
[3/2/18, 7:31:56 PM] Miller: Not broke enough to succumb to their pressure and delete the tweet
[3/2/18, 7:32:08 PM] Miller: First they came for my guns
[3/2/18, 7:32:13 PM] Dan Watts: @16102201963 must be advising him
[3/2/18, 7:32:14 PM] Miller: Then they came for my tweets
[3/2/18, 7:32:41 PM] Launchpad: At first I thought the C&D came from the Seinfeld camp
[3/2/18, 7:32:56 PM] Miller: I'd fight it in court
[3/2/18, 7:33:15 PM] Miller: Not 1 person with an iq above 20 would think olive garden ever solid AR15s
[3/2/18, 7:33:22 PM] Miller: Therefore it's clearly a joke
[3/2/18, 7:34:03 PM] Dan Watts: My buddy Dave created a non dairy product called NuMoo. And Bartlett Dairy one of the largest regional diary manufacturers has a product called NooMoo and sent him a cease and desist
[3/2/18, 7:34:22 PM] Dan Watts: Even though they're totally different things
[3/2/18, 7:34:27 PM] Miller: Brands are so dumb, like Wendy's and taco bell are the only companies who understand social media and the rest are all incompetent
[3/2/18, 7:34:55 PM] Dan Watts: Big corps don't play games
[3/2/18, 7:34:56 PM] Launchpad: what was it?
[3/2/18, 7:35:05 PM] Dan Watts: NooMoo is actually milk
[3/2/18, 7:35:08 PM] Miller: Should have changed the name to NotNooMoo that way nobody could get confused
[3/2/18, 7:35:18 PM] Dan Watts: numoo was made of almond or cashew milk
[3/2/18, 7:35:29 PM] Miller: They're both forms of milk
[3/2/18, 7:35:33 PM] Miller: They're kind of similar
[3/2/18, 7:35:34 PM] Launchpad: If they DONT protect their trademarks that can be brought up in court when they finally do
[3/2/18, 7:35:45 PM] Launchpad: yeah I would say thats VERY similar
[3/2/18, 7:35:52 PM] Launchpad: its not like milk & plumbing supplies
[3/2/18, 7:36:18 PM] Dan Watts: There's only so many things you can rhyme with moo ok
[3/2/18, 7:36:55 PM] Dan Watts: Anyway they ceased and desisted

[3/3/18, 8:59:25 AM] Scott: What's way money?
[3/3/18, 9:00:44 AM] Miller: The median profit for driving for either of the two large ride-hailing apps is just $13.37 an hour ‚Äî or about $107 for an eight-hour shift, according to a working paper from MILLER‚Äôs Center for Madeup and Nonsensical Research.
[3/3/18, 9:01:27 AM] Miller: Of course you know I cannot provide any details or information about the study so you will just have to take my word for it

[3/3/18, 9:37:31 AM] Donk: I just went over the tappan zee to go to tbe palisades mall. Its so windy they banned trucks on the bridge and as a result there are hundreds of trucks in the mall lots waiting for it to open back up

[3/3/18, 10:26:33 AM] Miller: Sorry should have rephrased it

[3/3/18, 10:27:08 AM] Miller: Now all the blogs can get their click bait headlines
[3/3/18, 10:37:49 AM] Sean: I‚Äôm sure the big city Uber drivers can but that takes into account the rest of the country where it isn‚Äôt popular
[3/3/18, 11:00:12 AM] Brian Katz: Fred was telling me his dad just chillled at the airport, and only responded to large fares
[3/3/18, 11:11:44 AM] Dan Watts: Lmao

[3/3/18, 8:41:23 PM] Justin: trust that over Uber paying for the study and publishing results, which has been linked to here before
[3/3/18, 8:46:22 PM] Miller: Joe is lucky he isn't in the 30% who make negative money, unless he also found golf lessons that charge negative money

[3/5/18, 10:26:39 AM] Scott: not much, especially cause its one page.  what i do know is that the little taxi companies that pickup at the trains etc are really pissed at uber and lyft and have tried to keep them out of LI.  i know that until recently you couldn't get an uber in westhampton and now you can, and you still cant get further out in suffolk, i.e. east hampton etc.  the little companies are doing everything they can to keep them away.
[3/5/18, 10:27:16 AM] Miller: its fucked up as part of the deal they made the uber prices in WH are just as bad as the local taxis
[3/5/18, 10:27:44 AM] Scott: that was part of that deal? i think it pre-dated that

If your kid comes home and says some other kid at school called them a name. Is it wrong to feed them insults to call the other child?
[3/5/18, 11:16:27 AM] Miller: depends

[3/5/18, 2:20:32 PM] Miller: distant 4th maybe 5th best QB
[3/5/18, 2:26:53 PM] Miller: Mayfield seems destined for the jets @ 6
[3/5/18, 2:26:57 PM] Miller: just a guess
[3/5/18, 2:27:55 PM] Donk: depends on cousins, but yeah
[3/5/18, 2:28:17 PM] Miller: 40/40/5/5 broncos/vikings/jets/cardinals
[3/5/18, 2:29:01 PM] Donk: 10% someone else?
[3/5/18, 2:29:44 PM] Miller: lol touche
[3/5/18, 2:29:50 PM] Miller: 45/45/5/5
[3/5/18, 2:30:14 PM] Donk: i think the jets are the darkhorse with the vikings being the favorite
[3/5/18, 2:30:27 PM] Donk: for some reason, i dont think him and elway will get along
[3/5/18, 2:30:59 PM] Miller: i think the $ will be similar and cant imagine why you would choose the jets over those other 2 teams who are both playoff ready
[3/5/18, 2:31:29 PM] Donk: jets can offer more than the vikings i think
[3/5/18, 2:31:49 PM] Miller: yea they can i just dont think they will
[3/5/18, 2:31:49 PM] Donk: and, could be for other reasons, like not wanting to live in minnesota over nj/ny
[3/5/18, 2:32:07 PM] Miller: if the jets offer him 150m gtd over 3 years with 90m next year then sure
[3/5/18, 2:32:32 PM] Donk: man, is it good to be cousins right now
[3/5/18, 2:33:08 PM] Donk: and thats after hes made like 50mil+ the past two years
[3/5/18, 2:34:05 PM] Miller: yea i was gonna say it was probably pretty good to be cousins already
[3/5/18, 2:49:29 PM] Miller: so im pretty sure of the "flat earth" idiots 90% of them are trolls who they think are trolling other people but are really just trolling other trolls
[3/5/18, 2:51:36 PM] Launchpad: lol
[3/5/18, 3:09:49 PM] Miller: https://www.maxmyinterest.com/ interesting idea

[3/5/18, 4:12:07 PM] Donk: i saw annihilation over the weekend
[3/5/18, 4:12:27 PM] Donk: very enjoyable, very interesting movie
[3/5/18, 4:14:43 PM] Miller: heard surprisingly good things, its coming out on international netflix in a couple of days i think so im gonna check it out
[3/5/18, 4:18:36 PM] Donk: yeah, i saw that too, but it looked liked the type of movie that would be best on the big screen (plus had some AMC giftcards sitting around)
[3/5/18, 4:19:41 PM] Brian Katz: The main guy looks exactly like Dennis from it‚Äôs always sunny

[3/5/18, 4:22:22 PM] Brian Katz: It may be based off Ken for all we know
[3/5/18, 4:23:01 PM] Miller: that guy had a very donk-like cadence too him
[3/5/18, 4:24:11 PM] Brian Katz: I can‚Äôt lie, if dink was found out to be a serial killer, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked.

[3/5/18, 4:31:58 PM] Donk: though maybe if i was like a poisoner or something, i could handle that. drop the poison in a drink and get out of there before anyone is the wiser....
[3/5/18, 4:33:00 PM] Miller: what about killing someone, decapitating them, and then having sexual relations with that severed head? is that out?

[3/6/18, 7:27:20 PM] Justin: if were gonna get real on the tariffs, i'm not saying i'm a fan of these tariffs.  But the idea that the US has no power over global trade, is outright bullshit.  Congress can't even vote to import pharmaceuticals for medicaid, CNN doesn't seem to care.  The US subsidizes Monsanto, cor-pro-farmers, big coal, and oil corporations  to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, yet no one talks about the trade inequity resulting from that.  Yet god forbid tariffs get passed on steel, the press and market loses their shit and Goldman goes a man down(oh no!). It's quintessential Orwellian new speak

[3/9/18, 7:37:33 PM] Miller: They're coming
[3/9/18, 7:43:35 PM] Tk: Decent moves so far. Especially when they are still holding their #1 n #4 picks.
[3/9/18, 8:51:29 PM] Justin: Yeh but taking smelling salt and bleeding all over gym every other workout to hit 5 pound personal records isn‚Äôt that impressive. It‚Äôs more you‚Äôre an asshole.
[3/9/18, 9:29:25 PM] Brian Katz: Oh for sure you‚Äôre an asshole

[3/10/18, 11:48:36 AM] Miller: Easiest fix possible
[3/10/18, 11:49:07 AM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs a temporary tattoo
[3/10/18, 11:49:12 AM] Miller: Ah
[3/10/18, 11:49:15 AM] Miller: Even easier
[3/10/18, 11:49:57 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah no big whoop. I appreciated it though, as it lead me to filling up my morning with this.
[3/10/18, 11:52:28 AM] Brian Katz: I wonder if someone will report our debate, and get this thread deleted.
[3/10/18, 11:53:11 AM] Miller: It was Principe in the living room with the laptop

[3/11/18, 1:03:37 PM] Dan Watts: Holy shit
[3/11/18, 1:04:50 PM] Brian Katz: They believe it was her ex boyfriend. Who has obviously fled town.
[3/11/18, 1:06:10 PM] Dan Watts: Just reading about it
[3/11/18, 1:06:20 PM] Dan Watts: He booked an international flight
[3/11/18, 1:06:38 PM] Brian Katz: Mr. world wide
[3/11/18, 1:07:06 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs crazy though. Has anything like ever happened there before?
[3/11/18, 1:07:14 PM] Brian Katz: That*
[3/11/18, 1:07:43 PM] Miller: Some guy shot up a post office there
[3/11/18, 1:07:51 PM] Dan Watts: A few years back some Serbian basketball player punched a student at a bar and killed the kid then fled to Serbia
[3/11/18, 1:08:04 PM] Miller: Oh yea
[3/11/18, 1:08:15 PM] Brian Katz: That sounds like more of an accident.
[3/11/18, 1:08:17 PM] Kiyoon: He's alive
[3/11/18, 1:08:21 PM] Miller: Did he die or was he in a coma?
[3/11/18, 1:08:28 PM] Kiyoon: But permanent brain damage
[3/11/18, 1:08:45 PM] Kiyoon: That kid was in one of my finance classes
[3/11/18, 1:09:15 PM] Brian Katz: After the fact?
[3/11/18, 1:09:25 PM] Kiyoon: No before
[3/11/18, 1:10:29 PM] Miller: Did you just ask if kiyoon was taking the same classes as a kid with brain damage?
[3/11/18, 1:10:42 PM] Brian Katz: It was a bad joke
[3/11/18, 1:11:16 PM] Launchpad: Great joke lol

[3/12/18, 4:46:34 PM] Tk: That girl that got murdered was in the nursing program w my gf's sister.  So was the bf(suspect) 
The family of the guy received a VM/text stating "iv done something horrible, brought shame to the family". They contacted one of the housemate's to check on him. That is what they discovered the body of the girl, strangulation. 
Dude had dual citizenship ship US n Nicaragua n left before they found the body.
[3/12/18, 4:46:39 PM] Tk: Jamie's sister knew both of them really well. She had been to their house, n like most ppl, they are shocked that he would be capable of the crime. Supposedly he was a normal nice guy.
[3/12/18, 4:46:39 PM] Tk: As for that dude that was in a coma from way back. He did recover from the coma n still managed to get his CPA some years after. I actually met him at a party some years back. Only noticeable  thing from the injury was slurring in his speech.
[3/12/18, 5:07:55 PM] Justin: Countdown until trump gets wind of it?

[3/14/18, 11:11:19 AM] Miller: no, so this house will not be done until nov/dec
[3/14/18, 11:11:26 AM] Miller: and i dont want to sell it until after i move out of this house so i will have some (hopefully short) period of overlap
[3/14/18, 11:11:44 AM] Miller: so gonna have to figure out wtf to do timing wise later
[3/14/18, 11:12:18 AM] Donk: ah, new construction?
[3/14/18, 11:12:53 AM] Miller: yea, was kind of my only option b/c tall ceilings in the basement was on my list of things i needed and all the original basements are all 6-7ft tops
[3/14/18, 11:13:56 AM] Donk: ha, gotta have room for those beer pong shot arcs
[3/14/18, 11:14:07 AM] Miller: exactly
[3/14/18, 11:28:56 AM] Brian Katz: Congrats miller! Sad to see the old house go. So many good times there. If you need help moving anything just ask.
[3/14/18, 11:29:44 AM] Miller: thanks man, yea lots of memories
[3/14/18, 11:30:15 AM] Miller: def 150% hiring movers so cannot imagine will need any help (though i do need your assistance on 1 trip out to westhampton at some point)
[3/14/18, 11:32:29 AM] Brian Katz: Sure, what we moving?

[3/14/18, 4:19:16 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/news/california-teacher-injures-three-pupils-131503194.html
[3/14/18, 4:19:21 PM] Justin: impossible to see this coming
[3/14/18, 4:20:54 PM] Justin: None of the students were seriously injured and lessons resumed after the incident, according to police.....becuase yeh I mean clearly the lesson on gun safety had to be finished after that
[3/14/18, 4:24:24 PM] Fberg: Shame those kids didn‚Äôt leave the classroom in protest today. Seems like the March out coincided nicely
[3/14/18, 4:38:34 PM] Launchpad: what the fuck is wrong with people https://nypost.com/2018/03/13/dog-dies-after-united-flight-attendant-forces-it-into-overhead-bin/
[3/14/18, 5:30:14 PM] Donk: at first i felt like the passenger was equally to blame
[3/14/18, 5:30:18 PM] Donk: because they allowed the dog to be shoved in there
[3/14/18, 5:31:12 PM] Donk: then i saw that united had 18 pets dies on their planes this year compared to 8 for all other us airlines combined
[3/14/18, 5:32:10 PM] Launchpad: who are they hiring to work there? Former prison guards?
[3/14/18, 5:32:11 PM] Fberg: i didnt realize animals were stored in the overhead
[3/14/18, 5:32:20 PM] Launchpad: they're not
[3/14/18, 5:32:38 PM] Launchpad: there is a cabin under the plane for larger animals
[3/14/18, 5:33:05 PM] Launchpad: This should be criminal negligence
[3/14/18, 5:34:53 PM] Scott: Lolz.
[3/14/18, 5:35:10 PM] Scott: Terrible situation. Should be criminal tho.
[3/14/18, 5:35:29 PM] Fberg: they have already claimed full responsibility, $$$$
[3/14/18, 5:36:06 PM] Launchpad: did the dog suffocate from lack of oxygen? heatstroke?
[3/14/18, 5:36:21 PM] Brian Katz: Lack of oxygen
[3/14/18, 5:36:41 PM] Launchpad: what kind of dumbass airline employee would not know that you shouldn't do that
[3/14/18, 5:37:33 PM] Fberg: feel like there shouldnt be any animals in the cabin
[3/14/18, 5:37:39 PM] Brian Katz: The one that made the passenger do that. Also if it was my dog, I would‚Äôve told that person to go fuck themselves.
[3/14/18, 5:38:06 PM] Brian Katz: It was a small dog probably.
[3/14/18, 5:38:07 PM] Launchpad: I would have at least checked up on the dog a few times to make sure he was ok
[3/14/18, 5:38:33 PM] Launchpad: there are plenty of small animals that travel and go by unnoticed
[3/14/18, 5:38:58 PM] Miller: i mean kind of but wtf you gonna say when the guy is saying do this or you are getting removed from the plane?
[3/14/18, 5:39:01 PM] Fberg: i just dont want to be stuck in a tiny cabin with a dog barking for 5 hours
[3/14/18, 5:39:20 PM] Launchpad: I dont want to be stuck in a cabin with a child crying for 5 hours
[3/14/18, 5:39:28 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôd tell the guy to go fuck himself
[3/14/18, 5:39:35 PM] Miller: also a decent amount of pets die in the "safe" under-the-plane storage
[3/14/18, 5:39:51 PM] Launchpad: and dogs bark when they are alone and couped up and ignored -- not just for fucks sake Ill bark for 5 hours
[3/14/18, 5:40:11 PM] Miller: thats fine but i think a lot of people would listen to the person who is in charge in that situation so i dont blame the people for doing that, obviously if the guy is telling you to you would assume it is safe
[3/14/18, 5:40:41 PM] Launchpad: exactly
[3/14/18, 5:40:48 PM] Brian Katz: If it was a bag sure. But I‚Äôm not putting a living thing in the overhead compartment
[3/14/18, 5:40:53 PM] Launchpad: you would think that maybe there was a precedence
[3/14/18, 5:40:58 PM] Miller: im not gonna victim blame here
[3/14/18, 5:41:02 PM] Miller: shitty situation
[3/14/18, 5:41:24 PM] Fberg: just incase, id still rather all animals be in the luggage part of the plane
[3/14/18, 5:41:29 PM] Miller: the media missed this one from today also

NEW: United Airlines says it accidentally sent a dog to Japan instead of Kansas. The family moving from Oregon went to pick up their dog and were given a Great Dane instead of their German Shepard. Unclear when the dog will arrive back in the US.
[3/14/18, 5:41:55 PM] Launchpad: you were saying @16312353198
[3/14/18, 5:42:03 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs terrible
[3/14/18, 5:42:23 PM] Fberg: missing dog, not dead
[3/14/18, 5:42:29 PM] Launchpad: if I ever traveled with Baxter hes coming with me under my seat
[3/14/18, 5:42:35 PM] Launchpad: give it time...
[3/14/18, 5:42:46 PM] Miller: honestly just dont travel via airplane w/your pets
[3/14/18, 5:42:49 PM] Miller: leave them home or go by car
[3/14/18, 5:42:55 PM] Fberg: alright you convinced me, no animals on planes at all
[3/14/18, 5:43:25 PM] Miller: presumably everyone saw the story of the lunatic who tried to bring a therapy peacock on a plane a month ago?
[3/14/18, 5:43:28 PM] Miller: fuck these people
[3/14/18, 5:43:36 PM] Miller: if you cannot fly w/o your therapy peacock then find another means of travel
[3/14/18, 5:44:22 PM] Fberg: they have hundreds of pills to fix that problem
[3/14/18, 5:45:06 PM] Launchpad: cant remember didnt that person call the airline ahead of time and they said it was ok?
[3/14/18, 5:45:15 PM] Miller: they claimed that yes
[3/14/18, 5:45:58 PM] Miller: or the story recently about the woman who tried flying with her hamster and the flight attendent told her to flush it down the toilet lol
[3/14/18, 5:46:31 PM] Launchpad: that was insane too
[3/14/18, 5:46:38 PM] Launchpad: hide it in your bra maybe?
[3/14/18, 5:46:39 PM] Miller: im sorry but if you would kill your pet b/c someone tells you to instead of making other arrangements you do not have a leg to stand on about being distraught
[3/14/18, 5:46:47 PM] Miller: call a friend to pick it up?
[3/14/18, 5:46:53 PM] Miller: call the animal society?
[3/14/18, 5:46:58 PM] Miller: do literally anything else?
[3/14/18, 5:48:06 PM] Launchpad: People are conditioned by 'authority'
[3/14/18, 5:48:18 PM] Fberg: should just start a pet airline
[3/14/18, 5:48:50 PM] Fberg: people will pay insane money for their pets
[3/14/18, 5:49:29 PM] Miller: i have the business plan for you @16312353198
[3/14/18, 5:49:35 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/14/18, 5:51:31 PM] Fberg: more like pet delivery service
[3/14/18, 5:51:42 PM] Fberg: with accomodations

[3/14/18, 10:00:41 PM] Miller: Yea lol almost no chance that's real
[3/14/18, 10:01:24 PM] Brian Katz: There‚Äôs a video, where the guy cuts the can open too.
[3/15/18, 6:25:29 AM] Miller: So juju, Drake, Travis Scott and Kim Dotcom were all playing fortnite together last night and streaming it? What a time to be alive
[3/15/18, 7:26:43 AM] Fberg: Glad I‚Äôve heard of at least Drake on that list
[3/15/18, 7:28:35 AM] Miller: You're unfamiliar with the 21 year old WR on the steelers?
[3/15/18, 7:36:41 AM] Fberg: Thought those were all rappers
[3/15/18, 7:37:04 AM] Fberg: Musicians?
[3/15/18, 7:37:27 AM] Miller: na just drake and travis
[3/15/18, 7:38:09 AM] Fberg: What‚Äôs a Kim Dotcom
[3/15/18, 7:38:12 AM] Miller: kim dotcom was the founder of megaupload (and later mega.co), really fascinating guy/story, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Dotcom
[3/15/18, 7:38:50 AM] Fberg: Not a cool rap name but def thought it could have been
[3/15/18, 7:39:00 AM] Miller: https://www.wired.com/2012/10/ff-kim-dotcom/ this is a better story on him
[3/15/18, 7:39:41 AM] Fberg: If he throws a ‚Äúlil‚Äù in front I think he‚Äôs got a name that works
[3/15/18, 10:06:33 AM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZla1ttZHaw&feature=youtu.be jimmy tatro cameo!
[3/15/18, 10:06:59 AM] Miller: (also new LD song/video)
[3/15/18, 10:10:32 AM] Donk: finished jessica jones, season def got better as it went along
[3/15/18, 10:10:42 AM] Miller: last 30 seconds are great
[3/15/18, 10:17:50 AM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/15/18, 10:23:03 AM] Launchpad: Kim Dotcom at one point was the top ranked Call of Duty player in the world
[3/15/18, 10:23:28 AM] Launchpad: dude is living about the best life you could imagine as a big giant fat guy
[3/15/18, 10:24:20 AM] Donk: hes living a pretty damn good life regardless fat or skinny
[3/15/18, 10:28:28 AM] Launchpad: lol
[3/15/18, 10:28:32 AM] Launchpad: true
[3/16/18, 10:22:58 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/16/18, 10:23:46 AM] Scott: Lol
[3/16/18, 10:26:18 AM] Fberg: that entire family is fucked up, after watching the Menendez story on FX, these trump kids must be totally fucked up as well
[3/16/18, 11:39:20 AM] Scott: how was that anyway?
[3/16/18, 11:39:21 AM] Scott: never saw it
[3/16/18, 11:40:25 AM] Fberg: its an interesting take on the menendez brothers side of the story, not much positive on the prosecutors side
[3/16/18, 11:40:43 AM] Fberg: boys were emotionally and physically abused by both mom and dad
[3/16/18, 11:40:46 AM] Donk: i gave up after 2 episdoes
[3/16/18, 11:42:27 AM] Fberg: very interesting in the sense that the menendez case took place right after the botched OJ trial, so this show made it seem like the prosecutors office was willing to do anything to get the brothers convicted out of fear that the DA office would continue to look incompetent
[3/16/18, 11:43:10 AM] Fberg: regardless, the FX show was entirely the defense side of the story
[3/16/18, 11:43:17 AM] Donk: the OJ show on FX was much better than the menedez one
[3/16/18, 11:44:47 AM] Fberg: the OJ one was better but the menendez show was worth a watch
[3/16/18, 11:45:17 AM] Fberg: ironically though i can't stand law and order show itself or SVU, basically any of them
[3/16/18, 12:02:48 PM] Fberg: https://twitter.com/FieldYates/status/974590393856688128
[3/16/18, 12:40:40 PM] Justin: The Waco show was kinda similar like that
[3/16/18, 1:23:20 PM] Fberg: was the Waco one any good?
[3/16/18, 2:57:55 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/16/18, 2:57:56 PM] Miller: im here for it
[3/16/18, 2:58:16 PM] Launchpad: ill def watch that
[3/16/18, 2:59:30 PM] Donk: 100% in
[3/16/18, 2:59:36 PM] Donk: saw the trailer the other day
[3/16/18, 3:20:43 PM] Justin: I liked Waco. Gave me whole new perspective on it. Think it was a little too one sided though. Still you never hear that side.
[3/16/18, 3:25:22 PM] Fberg: Same reason I liked menendez story. Though I‚Äôve been watching this Versace show now. Has nothing at all to do with the law or case itself. Mostly about the plight of the gay man in America
[3/16/18, 3:26:13 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/16/18, 3:32:21 PM] Launchpad: showed my coworkers this, they thought its funny
[3/16/18, 3:39:15 PM] Dan Watts: Guy has his own gods
[3/16/18, 4:26:38 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/16/18, 4:27:03 PM] Brian Katz: Anyone see the new avenger trailer? Looks epic.
[3/16/18, 4:27:33 PM] Miller: I try to avoid watching trailers for movies I know I'm going to see
[3/16/18, 4:27:45 PM] Miller: It's insane they literally show you the entire plot
[3/16/18, 4:28:04 PM] Miller: I'll watch it if it's a movie I'm on the fence or not planning on seeing
[3/16/18, 4:29:08 PM] Justin: yeh, the onyl thing is they makign it seem like this is the end, we all know they gonna make this into 3 movies and have 14 other movies in between
[3/16/18, 4:29:16 PM] Brian Katz: There‚Äôs no spoilers in it. It just shows some of the interactions, and battles.
[3/16/18, 4:30:22 PM] Fberg: read a week or so ago that marvel is releasing at least 6 movies over next 2-3 years
[3/16/18, 4:30:27 PM] Brian Katz: This is a two parter. It ends with avengers 4 infinity war part 2.  You‚Äôll probably see a lot of the original actors move on at that point.
[3/16/18, 4:30:46 PM] Brian Katz: We get ant man and wasp later this summer
[3/16/18, 4:30:56 PM] Fberg: saw trailer for new antman movie recently
[3/16/18, 4:31:18 PM] Brian Katz: And they may even add Deadpool to the mcu, because Disney is buying everything.
[3/16/18, 4:31:22 PM] Justin: yeh im not buying the 2 parter
[3/16/18, 4:31:31 PM] Justin: i know they said that is the plan
[3/16/18, 4:31:36 PM] Brian Katz: Why, they announced it
[3/16/18, 4:31:47 PM] Launchpad: Ant Man? geez they really running out of ideas
[3/16/18, 4:31:54 PM] Brian Katz: So what are you not buying? Lol
[3/16/18, 4:32:08 PM] Brian Katz: Ant man was great. It‚Äôs hilarious.
[3/16/18, 4:32:22 PM] Justin: that studios always turn the alst movie into 2 movies
[3/16/18, 4:32:30 PM] Justin: and considering how well black panther did
[3/16/18, 4:32:41 PM] Justin: no reason to believe they cant add black panther 2/3 and some other shit
[3/16/18, 4:32:44 PM] Justin: and then do this in 3
[3/16/18, 4:33:02 PM] Brian Katz: But this  is a huge comic storyline. Not a book that they are stretching out.!
[3/16/18, 4:33:09 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/16/18, 4:33:11 PM] Justin: i mean its the same thing
[3/16/18, 4:33:36 PM] Justin: maybe you arte right in that actor costs are insnae now and starting over is more profitable
[3/16/18, 4:33:46 PM] Brian Katz: No, they‚Äôre not fluffing up one part to make two movies.
[3/16/18, 4:33:48 PM] Justin: idk, could also destroy everything in part 2 of the marvel universe
[3/16/18, 4:34:20 PM] Justin: so If im a studio head, and i see how well black panther did, if i hadnt planned BP 2, I sure as fuck have planned it now
[3/16/18, 4:34:28 PM] Justin: not sure if there was supposed to be a BP 2
[3/16/18, 4:34:52 PM] Justin: but i agree it looks pretty awesome
[3/16/18, 4:34:53 PM] Brian Katz: He‚Äôs not dying
[3/16/18, 4:34:53 PM] Miller: Yea i agree with katz, they plan this shit out like 6 years in advance, it's not like they didn't expect them to do well when they originally planned it
[3/16/18, 4:35:18 PM] Justin: assumes plan hasnt been fluid
[3/16/18, 4:35:28 PM] Justin: maybe your right and its bene strict
[3/16/18, 4:35:30 PM] Brian Katz: But they already have plans for 22 movies after avengers 4. They‚Äôre going to remake the avengers with newer members.
[3/16/18, 4:35:37 PM] Justin: i dont think they aftually knew the movies they were filling in blnaks iwth
[3/16/18, 4:35:38 PM] Miller: Go back and check, they announced this stuff years ago
[3/16/18, 4:35:42 PM] Justin: they did that as it went along
[3/16/18, 4:36:17 PM] Justin: they announced everything in phases
[3/16/18, 4:36:21 PM] Brian Katz: They announced a stage system after Ironman was a success.
[3/16/18, 4:36:26 PM] Justin: what im saying is no reason to believe the last phase wont get longer
[3/16/18, 4:36:28 PM] Miller: Yes obviously all the side character movies like BP or gotg or wonder woman or whatever are dependant upon reception to determine if they make more
[3/16/18, 4:37:02 PM] Miller: If antman had made 9 dollars clearly there would not be a sequel
[3/16/18, 4:37:13 PM] Miller: Doesn't change their broad group plan though
[3/16/18, 4:38:01 PM] Brian Katz: You won‚Äôt see another iron man, cap, or Thor movie. Expect them to die.
[3/16/18, 4:38:15 PM] Justin: yeh i guess it could also be about the contracts
[3/16/18, 4:38:16 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/16/18, 4:38:23 PM] Miller: A black panther sequel was not part of the plan they laid out
[3/16/18, 4:38:25 PM] Justin: like downey had x films he had to appear in
[3/16/18, 4:38:31 PM] Miller: Obviously something like that could be added
[3/16/18, 4:38:33 PM] Justin: so maybe their isnt room for another film
[3/16/18, 4:38:52 PM] Miller: But in terms of the shit they announced they usually stick to that
[3/16/18, 4:39:09 PM] Brian Katz: You‚Äôre over saturated with certain hero‚Äôs
[3/16/18, 4:39:19 PM] Donk: yeah, they already filmed the two infinity war movies
[3/16/18, 4:39:20 PM] Donk: they are going to split it into two
[3/16/18, 4:39:21 PM] Donk: arent going to i mean
[3/16/18, 4:39:47 PM] Justin: In November 2017, Kevin Feige stated that there are currently 20 movies that are planned to be made after Avengers 4
[3/16/18, 4:39:51 PM] Justin: ok maybe not then
[3/16/18, 4:40:33 PM] Fberg: only marvel movie so far i thought was just too cheesy/lame was Wonder Woman
[3/16/18, 4:41:23 PM] Brian Katz: Every marvel movie makes a ton of money. So they don‚Äôt care about ending certain characters, and moving on. Since it‚Äôs all connected, the viewer is invested in everyone‚Äôs story.
[3/16/18, 4:41:23 PM] Fberg: even the most recent Spiderman Homecoming movie i thought was great, and its like the 20th spiderman theres been
[3/16/18, 4:41:45 PM] Justin: you mean all the slow motion gal gadot whipping her hair back and forth didnt give you a sense of how amazing feminism is
[3/16/18, 4:42:07 PM] Brian Katz: Plus when thanos gets the infinity gauntlet, I‚Äôd love to see the X-men become apart of the universe, cause Disney own it all! Lol
[3/16/18, 4:42:10 PM] Fberg: her outfit was the only reason i paid attention
[3/16/18, 4:42:50 PM] Brian Katz: Should they have casted Lena Dunham then?
[3/16/18, 4:43:06 PM] Fberg: def wouldnt have watched it
[3/16/18, 4:43:39 PM] Justin: Lol.
[3/16/18, 4:43:48 PM] Fberg: basically they could have casted anyone on stage with Taylor Swift in that infamous picture on stage with her squad, except Dunham
[3/16/18, 4:44:15 PM] Justin: I‚Äôm just saying I went in there expecting all the bullshit the critics were saying. I left like ok that‚Äôs a pretty average super here movie and I‚Äôm not getting the feminism part.
[3/16/18, 4:44:58 PM] Brian Katz: That shit was okay. I hated her villain.
[3/16/18, 4:44:59 PM] Justin: Black panther lived up to the hype of its racial elements and was awesome movie
[3/16/18, 4:45:07 PM] Fberg: I did think everything about Black Panther was awesome, even the music from Kendrick Lamar, except Michael B Jordan was terrible
[3/16/18, 4:45:25 PM] Justin: As soon as I saw that dude in that roll I‚Äôm like this guy is the bad guy
[3/16/18, 4:45:37 PM] Brian Katz: Crazy talk, he was best part.
[3/16/18, 4:45:58 PM] Justin: I thought whole end part where he‚Äôs got dagger in his chest was dumb
[3/16/18, 4:46:02 PM] Brian Katz: DC movies suck, outside of Batman
[3/16/18, 4:46:11 PM] Justin: And part where black panther gets spear thru arm but is cool was dumb
[3/16/18, 4:46:18 PM] Justin: But superhero movie and all
[3/16/18, 4:46:35 PM] Fberg: MBJ said his lines like he was reading them off a piece of paper
[3/16/18, 4:46:42 PM] Donk: you guys know that wonderwoman is not a marvel movie right?
[3/16/18, 4:46:48 PM] Fberg: yea its DC
[3/16/18, 4:46:53 PM] Fberg: still was overrated
[3/16/18, 4:47:06 PM] Donk: it was fun
[3/16/18, 4:47:09 PM] Donk: def the best DC movie
[3/16/18, 4:47:13 PM] Donk: which isnt say much
[3/16/18, 4:47:24 PM] Fberg: and im only mentioning Michael B Jordan becaus the rest of Black Panther was fantastic imo
[3/16/18, 4:47:41 PM] Brian Katz: Any Batman movie is better
[3/16/18, 4:47:51 PM] Fberg: yea im gonna agree with Katz on this one
[3/16/18, 4:47:55 PM] Donk: yeah, i meant the DC cinema universe
[3/16/18, 4:47:56 PM] Donk: sorry
[3/16/18, 4:48:01 PM] Donk: those batmans were pre that really
[3/16/18, 4:48:07 PM] Justin: I think they did a poor job building his character
[3/16/18, 4:48:15 PM] Fberg: Batflect > WW
[3/16/18, 4:48:21 PM] Donk: and it was better than some of the batmans (batman and robin, batman forever, etc)
[3/16/18, 4:48:24 PM] Justin: Like when he shot that girl, it was like ok...
[3/16/18, 4:48:41 PM] Brian Katz: Which Batman is in
[3/16/18, 4:48:48 PM] Donk: none of them
[3/16/18, 4:48:52 PM] Donk: they havent made one yet that is part of it
[3/16/18, 4:49:07 PM] Donk: its really man of steel, superman v batman, justice league, wonderwoman
[3/16/18, 4:49:13 PM] Brian Katz: True, I forgot those don‚Äôt count. DC sucks
[3/16/18, 4:49:13 PM] Donk: and sucide squad
[3/16/18, 4:49:40 PM] Donk: wonderwoman was easily the best of those 5
[3/16/18, 4:49:41 PM] Fberg: i would watch a movie based on Will Smith's character from Suicide Squad
[3/16/18, 4:50:00 PM] Donk: and on a side note, Dark Knight is one of the more overrated movies ever
[3/16/18, 4:50:04 PM] Brian Katz: I would not. That‚Äôs Deadpool light
[3/16/18, 4:50:06 PM] Donk: yes, Heath Ledger was great
[3/16/18, 4:50:15 PM] Brian Katz: Crazy talk
[3/16/18, 4:50:23 PM] Donk: but batman begins was better than dark knight
[3/16/18, 4:50:24 PM] Fberg: Will Smith was Deadshot?
[3/16/18, 4:50:24 PM] Brian Katz: Won an Oscar
[3/16/18, 4:50:30 PM] Brian Katz: Crazy talk
[3/16/18, 4:50:35 PM] Brian Katz: Yes
[3/16/18, 4:50:48 PM] Fberg: Batman Begins was epic
[3/16/18, 4:50:52 PM] Fberg: changed superhero movies
[3/16/18, 4:51:03 PM] Brian Katz: Dark knight by far the best
[3/16/18, 4:51:06 PM] Donk: dark knight is a good movie with a great peformance from ledger
[3/16/18, 4:51:25 PM] Fberg: story would have been better had he not died obivously
[3/16/18, 4:51:46 PM] Brian Katz: Dark knight is why we have an mcu
[3/16/18, 4:51:55 PM] Donk: thats not true
[3/16/18, 4:51:56 PM] Miller: I think tdkr is actually the overrated of the 3
[3/16/18, 4:52:06 PM] Donk: that is cearly the wrost of the 3
[3/16/18, 4:52:06 PM] Miller: And wonder woman and gal gadot was great
[3/16/18, 4:52:14 PM] Donk: i dont think anoyone is doubting that
[3/16/18, 4:52:20 PM] Fberg: WW was so boring
[3/16/18, 4:52:26 PM] Donk: iron man came out before dark knight did, no?
[3/16/18, 4:52:31 PM] Donk: so the mcu started before that
[3/16/18, 4:53:00 PM] Fberg: TDKR was suppose to have Joker in it I think, plus Bane
[3/16/18, 4:53:01 PM] Donk: same year it turns out, but still, i dont think they are related
[3/16/18, 4:53:23 PM] Brian Katz: Ironman is 10 years old
[3/16/18, 4:53:35 PM] Brian Katz: Dark knight is right around then.
[3/16/18, 4:53:41 PM] Donk: yeah, both came out in 08
[3/16/18, 4:53:53 PM] Donk: so i dont think that the dark knight is the reason we have the MCU
[3/16/18, 4:54:05 PM] Miller: I love Tom Hardy but that bane was bad
[3/16/18, 4:54:16 PM] Brian Katz: Lol, going against my argument Batman returns is then lol
[3/16/18, 4:54:23 PM] Miller: Didn't help I couldn't hear anything he was saying
[3/16/18, 4:54:36 PM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs the dark knight rises
[3/16/18, 4:54:47 PM] Miller: Yea i said tdkr
[3/16/18, 4:54:56 PM] Fberg: is he going to say more in Venom?
[3/16/18, 4:55:08 PM] Brian Katz: Not that much more
[3/16/18, 4:55:16 PM] Fberg: Hardy barely speaks in all his movies
[3/16/18, 4:55:21 PM] Donk: hes great in mad max and barely talks lol
[3/16/18, 4:55:24 PM] Brian Katz: Mad max
[3/16/18, 4:55:34 PM] Brian Katz: He doesn‚Äôt need to talk
[3/16/18, 4:55:43 PM] Justin: Blah
[3/16/18, 4:55:53 PM] Donk: it was a "mad max" movie but it was really a charlize theron movie
[3/16/18, 4:56:05 PM] Fberg: agree, she stole that movie
[3/16/18, 4:56:24 PM] Fberg: like Chris Waltz in Djengo
[3/16/18, 4:56:43 PM] Brian Katz: Or Chris waltz in inglorious bastards
[3/16/18, 4:57:23 PM] Fberg: true, though i did enjoy Brad Pitts character in that one
[3/16/18, 4:57:59 PM] Brian Katz: I mean how could you not? He‚Äôs a awesome nazi killing leader, who speaks some Italian lol
[3/16/18, 4:58:20 PM] Brian Katz: Bonjourno!
[3/16/18, 4:59:24 PM] Brian Katz: What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite Tarantino flick? Mines gotta be kill bill.
[3/16/18, 4:59:43 PM] Miller: Tom Hardy also barely speaks in Dunkirk
[3/16/18, 5:00:17 PM] Fberg: Pulp Fiction.....so many classic scenes and lines
[3/16/18, 5:00:31 PM] Miller: I think he speaks a lot in warrior but honestly can't remember, I know Joel Edgerton does
[3/16/18, 5:00:32 PM] Brian Katz: You okay?
Hell no im not okay
[3/16/18, 5:00:49 PM] Brian Katz: He does not. Barely talks in it.
[3/16/18, 5:00:58 PM] Fberg: Tom Hardy barely spoke in the moonshine movie, forgetting the name
[3/16/18, 5:01:06 PM] Fberg: Shia Labouf was in it
[3/16/18, 5:01:53 PM] Fberg: Lawless
[3/16/18, 5:02:08 PM] Brian Katz: Shia lebooo
[3/16/18, 5:02:11 PM] Fberg: What does Marcellus Wallace look like???
[3/16/18, 5:02:27 PM] Brian Katz: Does he look like a bitch?
[3/16/18, 5:02:40 PM] Fberg: so why you try to fuck him like a bitch
[3/16/18, 5:03:10 PM] Brian Katz: May I have a sip of this tasty beverage?
[3/16/18, 5:03:33 PM] Fberg: im a mushroom cloud laying motherfucka, motherfucka, im superfly tnt, im the guns of the navarone
[3/16/18, 5:03:54 PM] Fberg: oh damn, i shot marvin in the face

[3/16/18, 5:04:12 PM] Miller: Same
[3/16/18, 5:04:33 PM] Brian Katz: My wife buys the cheap stuff. I can‚Äôt stand it. That‚Äôs why but the good stuff. So I know my coffee is good. I don‚Äôt need you to fucking tell me about it.
[3/16/18, 5:05:11 PM] Brian Katz: Does it say dead nigger storage in front of my house?
[3/16/18, 5:05:55 PM] Fberg: i think the action in Kill Bill is much better than Pulp Fiction, but the dialogue in PF is the best
[3/16/18, 5:06:59 PM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs almost as good.
[3/16/18, 5:09:23 PM] Fberg: Tarantino and Guy Richie probably only two directors i will see all movies
[3/16/18, 5:09:45 PM] Miller: I'm not a huge guy Richie guy
[3/16/18, 5:09:54 PM] Fberg: would have included James Cameron but realized ive never seen Avatar and will never see it
[3/16/18, 5:10:03 PM] Brian Katz: Guy Ritchie blows besides snatch, lock stock, and rock n rolla
[3/16/18, 5:10:17 PM] Fberg: fast talking, british ganster movies from guy richie are my favorites
[3/16/18, 5:10:30 PM] Miller: Also you're forgetting Christopher Nolan
[3/16/18, 5:10:47 PM] Fberg: the King Arthur movie with Sons of Anarchy guy was great i thought
[3/16/18, 5:10:55 PM] Fberg: yes Nolan ill include in the last
[3/16/18, 5:11:45 PM] Fberg: Richie's Sherlock Holmes movies with RDJ were good enough
[3/16/18, 5:11:47 PM] Miller: And my boy Justin lin
[3/16/18, 5:11:57 PM] Miller: But only for fast and furious movies
[3/16/18, 5:14:50 PM] Fberg: Richie has only really directed 8 movies so far, 9 if you include a bullshit movie he clearly did for his wife Madonna at the  time
[3/16/18, 5:15:23 PM] Miller: Ryan Coogler 3/3 with fruitvale, creed, and black panther
[3/16/18, 5:15:27 PM] Fberg: Revolver was very low key
[3/16/18, 5:15:29 PM] Miller: Guess he really likes MBJ
[3/16/18, 5:17:17 PM] Miller: He's not directing creed 2 apparently
[3/16/18, 5:20:08 PM] Fberg: still havent seen creed 1
[3/16/18, 5:20:27 PM] Miller: Wtf is wrong with you
[3/16/18, 5:20:28 PM] Fberg: that is rocky training creed's son?
[3/16/18, 5:20:53 PM] Miller: It's on TV constantly also
[3/16/18, 5:21:18 PM] Fberg: i did watch most of Ricky II the other night
[3/16/18, 5:21:27 PM] Fberg: Rocky*
[3/16/18, 5:21:45 PM] Miller: Have you not seen all of them?
[3/16/18, 5:21:56 PM] Fberg: everyone of them, except Creed
[3/16/18, 5:22:10 PM] Miller: You should change that
[3/16/18, 5:22:10 PM] Fberg: cant really explain why i havent, guess that should be on the list
[3/16/18, 5:22:45 PM] Fberg: and just to clarify, Michael B Jordan will always and forever be Wallace from the Wire
[3/16/18, 5:23:43 PM] Fberg: i saw Marlo Stanfield playing someone's lawyer in the Tupac/Biggie show on USA recently
[3/16/18, 5:24:10 PM] Miller: Nice that he finally went to law school
[3/16/18, 5:24:47 PM] Fberg: marlo and I had to make some tough life choices recently about law school
[3/16/18, 5:33:08 PM] Donk: Michael b Jordan will always be vince from FNL

[3/22/18, 9:09:51 AM] Brian Katz: I got bombed. Just was able to get on a train now. Started shoveling at 6:30.
[3/22/18, 9:11:26 AM] Miller: i didnt shovel except for clearing off my car but yea we got like 8-10" probabl
[3/22/18, 9:11:37 AM] Miller: trains were running fine though
[3/22/18, 9:11:51 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah, at least there was that.
[3/22/18, 9:12:07 AM] Brian Katz: I got about 12

[3/22/18, 9:15:14 AM] Brian Katz: Yeah
[3/22/18, 9:15:28 AM] Miller: you dont get snow days as adults
[3/22/18, 9:15:42 AM] Brian Katz: What‚Äôd you get in dc Kiyoon
[3/22/18, 9:15:51 AM] Fberg: damn LI taking a beating these last 2 weeks
[3/22/18, 9:15:59 AM] Kiyoon: can you work from home
[3/22/18, 9:16:01 AM] Fberg: Westchester only got maybe 4-5 inches
[3/22/18, 9:16:07 AM] Kiyoon: where I live we got about 4 inches
[3/22/18, 9:16:12 AM] Kiyoon: where I work we got about 7-8
[3/22/18, 9:16:18 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs lucky
[3/22/18, 9:16:21 AM] Kiyoon: worked form home yesterday
[3/22/18, 9:16:42 AM] Launchpad: not being able to work from home in 10 inches of snow is pretty lame
[3/22/18, 9:16:58 AM] Kiyoon: yeah wtf
[3/22/18, 9:17:26 AM] Kiyoon: though I guess it's the day after and I assume roads are probably fine
[3/22/18, 9:17:26 AM] Brian Katz: Yo, we got to go out and make that cheddar
[3/22/18, 9:17:36 AM] Miller: it took me 10 minutes to clear my car off
[3/22/18, 9:17:40 AM] Miller: the trains were fine
[3/22/18, 9:17:40 AM] Kiyoon: NY got a pretty big snow budget
[3/22/18, 9:17:43 AM] Miller: why am i working from home again?
[3/22/18, 9:18:00 AM] Kiyoon: Millz you probably didnt properly clean the snow off your car
[3/22/18, 9:18:05 AM] Launchpad: idk im working from home
[3/22/18, 9:18:06 AM] Miller: i did actually
[3/22/18, 9:18:15 AM] Kiyoon: are you one of those assholes that leaves the roof and back windsheild covered
[3/22/18, 9:18:18 AM] Brian Katz: I didn‚Äôt
[3/22/18, 9:18:21 AM] Miller: nope, 100% clean
[3/22/18, 9:18:25 AM] Kiyoon: good
[3/22/18, 9:18:35 AM] Brian Katz: I was shot after shoveling
[3/22/18, 9:18:42 AM] Kiyoon: lots of virginians don't understand that you shouldn't drive with snow still all over the car
[3/22/18, 9:18:51 AM] Miller: there was way too much snow to leave
[3/22/18, 9:19:02 AM] Brian Katz: Hopefully it all melts at the train station
[3/22/18, 9:19:39 AM] Miller: only thing im bad w/is if there is ice and i have not budgeted time in the AM, ill just scrape off like a window in front of the driver side windshield and can only see through that for 3-4 min until the defroster melts it
[3/22/18, 9:19:41 AM] Brian Katz: I lost 2lbs after shoveling lol.
[3/22/18, 9:19:46 AM] Miller: but no ice today so all good
[3/22/18, 9:21:31 AM] Fberg: also should be in the 40's next few days so snow will melt and hopefully not freeze
[3/22/18, 9:21:41 AM] Miller: i probably look like a moron but i just use my arm to clear all the snow off my car
[3/22/18, 9:21:50 AM] Miller: that ice scraper thing is usefuil for ice but useless for snow
[3/22/18, 9:22:09 AM] Brian Katz: Agreed, I do the same thing
[3/22/18, 9:31:07 AM] Donk: i used a push broom for the car
[3/22/18, 9:31:21 AM] Donk: 100% the way to go, takes 2 minutes and you dont get covered in snow
[3/22/18, 9:31:30 AM] Brian Katz: Not a bad idea.
[3/22/18, 9:31:49 AM] Brian Katz: Like one of those custodian brooms?
[3/22/18, 9:32:16 AM] Miller: yea that could work, just not something i have or if i do i have no idea where it is
[3/22/18, 9:32:26 AM] Donk: yeah
[3/22/18, 9:32:53 AM] Donk: i thought it was a pretty standard garage tool, but maybe not everyone has one
[3/22/18, 9:33:08 AM] Donk: its main purpose is to sweep the garage for leaves/dirt taht gets in there
[3/22/18, 9:34:38 AM] Miller: it is 100% possible i have on in my garage
[3/22/18, 9:34:49 AM] Fberg: @16318489683 dont you have a garage you can use?
[3/22/18, 9:34:58 AM] Miller: i have never swept my garage
[3/22/18, 9:35:14 AM] Miller: seems as useful as sweeping my drivewayu
[3/22/18, 9:35:58 AM] Brian Katz: I do but it‚Äôs in my back yard. So I haven‚Äôt bothered with it yet. Next snowstorm I‚Äôll see if that‚Äôs easier,
[3/22/18, 9:37:06 AM] Fberg: may be time to invest in snowblower too
[3/22/18, 9:37:33 AM] Brian Katz: I actually have one at my office. I was lazy and didn‚Äôt pick it up.
[3/22/18, 9:37:38 AM] Fberg: my dad has one for his long driveway, shoveling is so 20th century
[3/22/18, 9:37:38 AM] Miller: so i learned my lesson after my first snowstorm in my house when i moved
[3/22/18, 9:37:42 AM] Miller: i parked in my garage
[3/22/18, 9:37:52 AM] Miller: problem was now i had to shovel my entire driveway to get my car out
[3/22/18, 9:38:07 AM] Miller: now i park on the street and just clear my car off and drive off
[3/22/18, 9:38:31 AM] Miller: and yes a snowblower is a must
[3/22/18, 9:39:19 AM] Fberg: if you have the snowblower you can clear off the driveway once or twice while its still snowing, makes things so much easier, especially if its that wet heavy snow
[3/22/18, 9:39:53 AM] Miller: i dont bother shoveling my driveway anymore
[3/22/18, 9:40:08 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs smart
[3/22/18, 9:40:14 AM] Brian Katz: Why bother
[3/22/18, 9:40:38 AM] Fberg: @millz your driveway is so short, i probably wouldnt shovel either
[3/22/18, 9:40:42 AM] Brian Katz: Will you have gage same luxury in your new place?
[3/22/18, 9:40:52 AM] Miller: i dont see why not
[3/22/18, 9:41:16 AM] Brian Katz: Maybe you have a long driveway, narrow streets idk
[3/22/18, 9:41:30 AM] Miller: driveway will be wider so can park both cars there
[3/22/18, 9:41:47 AM] Miller: still dont see why i would need to shovel anything more than a walkway though
[3/22/18, 9:41:51 AM] Miller: which is what i do now
[3/22/18, 9:42:39 AM] Fberg: you will also eventually have two workers to send out and shovel for/with you
[3/22/18, 9:42:52 AM] Donk: not using the garagae is crazy to me
[3/22/18, 9:43:10 AM] Donk: my one real complaint with my house is only having the one car garage instead of two
[3/22/18, 9:43:24 AM] Miller: yea garage is not even an option for me now as it is just full of crap
[3/22/18, 9:44:01 AM] Miller: new place will have a 2 car garage but will probably be filled w/2x as much crap so not expecting to park any cars in there but maybe
[3/22/18, 9:44:03 AM] Donk: so much better to get into the car on a cold winter mornigng (or hot summer moring even) and have the car nice and temp controlled
[3/22/18, 9:44:51 AM] Miller: biggest issue is storing my patio furniture in the winter
[3/22/18, 9:44:55 AM] Miller: takes up so much space
[3/22/18, 9:45:04 AM] Launchpad: damn you guys need full size houses just to store all your winter gear
[3/22/18, 9:45:21 AM] Miller: patio furniture = winter geat
[3/22/18, 9:45:23 AM] Miller: gear
[3/22/18, 9:45:29 AM] Miller: car = winter gear
[3/22/18, 9:45:41 AM] Miller: ill give you snowblower
[3/22/18, 9:45:50 AM] Brian Katz: I stored all my patio furniture in my garage too
[3/22/18, 9:46:16 AM] Miller: i never even took it out last summer
[3/22/18, 9:46:23 AM] Miller: if i go one more summer w/o using it i am getting rid of it
[3/22/18, 9:46:38 AM] Donk: i leave the patio table outside, but i do bring in the chairs/umbrella
[3/22/18, 9:47:05 AM] Fberg: is it gas powered snowblower?
[3/22/18, 9:47:05 AM] Kiyoon: just put a cover over it
[3/22/18, 9:47:28 AM] Miller: yea
[3/22/18, 9:47:31 AM] Donk: i have a snowblower too, but tbh, havent even bothered with it this winter
[3/22/18, 9:47:38 AM] Donk: ive just been shoveling instead
[3/22/18, 9:47:56 AM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/22/18, 9:48:19 AM] Donk: ironically being too lazy to deal with getting the gas has resulted in more work by shoveling
[3/22/18, 9:48:20 AM] Miller: the non-attached garage makes it incrementally less useful
[3/22/18, 9:48:26 AM] Brian Katz: I like getting the exercise
[3/22/18, 9:48:28 AM] Fberg: looks similar to type my dad has, those things are totally worth it when you have a large driveway
[3/22/18, 9:49:22 AM] Fberg: day like yesterday i wouldnt have minded shoveling, but shoveling before work would make me use the snowblower
[3/22/18, 9:49:30 AM] Fberg: i never been a morning exercise guy
[3/22/18, 9:49:45 AM] Miller: yea neither of those are options for me before work
[3/22/18, 9:50:38 AM] Miller: leaving evan w/all the shoveling responsibilities
[3/22/18, 9:50:59 AM] Miller: it sucks b/c he actually wants to shovel but he is obviously useless whereas i know when hes older and able to be useful he will not want to
[3/22/18, 9:51:27 AM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/22/18, 9:51:30 AM] Brian Katz: You never know
[3/22/18, 9:51:44 AM] Brian Katz: That‚Äôs a classic episode
[3/22/18, 9:52:09 AM] Fberg: have him watch rocky IV (or whichever is one he fights Russian) night before the snowstorm

[3/22/18, 9:57:28 AM] Brian Katz: He still ugly as son?
[3/22/18, 9:57:34 AM] Brian Katz: Sin*

[3/22/18, 9:57:41 AM] Brian Katz: Lol
[3/22/18, 9:57:57 AM] Fberg: crew was Herman, Pete and EJ
[3/22/18, 9:58:05 AM] Miller: totally forgot about him but i used to end up hanging out w/him w/herman a bunch back in the day and then he was gone
[3/22/18, 9:58:15 AM] Brian Katz: Pete had to be in the all time ugly team.
[3/22/18, 9:58:32 AM] Fberg: he kiaser soze'd himself
[3/22/18, 9:59:11 AM] Fberg: he married a girl we went to high school with, no idea of what happened with him after that

[3/22/18, 11:02:41 AM] Kiyoon: it sure is
[3/22/18, 11:06:03 AM] Fberg: trump wants so badly to be Putin...sad
[3/22/18, 11:34:51 AM] Miller: John Dowd resigns as Trump's lead attorney - NYT
[3/22/18, 11:34:58 AM] Miller: ü§î
[3/22/18, 11:35:30 AM] Fberg: just saw that
[3/22/18, 11:35:46 AM] Launchpad: In next weeks episode of 'The Apprentice: White House Addition"
[3/22/18, 11:35:48 AM] Fberg: crazy that trump didn't listen to his advice
[3/22/18, 11:36:56 AM] Fberg: ill give trump props for that karen mcdougal playmate, but stormy daniels ehh
[3/22/18, 11:37:04 AM] Fberg: just huge tits
[3/22/18, 11:38:19 AM] Fberg: think the apprentice woman who he allegedly assaulted or whatever is more attractive than daniels
[3/22/18, 11:53:33 AM] Justin: lol Trump sitting down to talk with Mueller, is a prosecutors dream
[3/22/18, 12:01:13 PM] Fberg: should put it on pay-per-view, id pay more for that than the next Mayweather fight
[3/22/18, 12:02:45 PM] Justin: drinking game- take a shot for every new felony count Trump just exposed himself to
[3/22/18, 12:09:36 PM] Launchpad: take a hit of meth for every felony Trump actually gets charged with

[3/22/18, 6:01:33 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/22/18, 6:04:20 PM] Justin: i dont get that shot
[3/22/18, 6:04:23 PM] Justin: like why did he do that
[3/22/18, 6:04:25 PM] Launchpad: Mets fans are pretty scary for sure
[3/22/18, 6:04:31 PM] Miller: They were down 3
[3/22/18, 6:04:32 PM] Justin: was this a case of the miller kiyoon argument
[3/22/18, 6:04:36 PM] Miller: He got intentionally fouled
[3/22/18, 6:04:41 PM] Justin: they werent down 3
[3/22/18, 6:04:41 PM] Miller: He made the first free throw
[3/22/18, 6:04:49 PM] Miller: Intentionally missed the second
[3/22/18, 6:04:56 PM] Justin: they won 75-73
[3/22/18, 6:04:59 PM] Miller: Then got the rebound and hit the 3
[3/22/18, 6:05:03 PM] Justin: so presumably if it was a buzzer beater
[3/22/18, 6:05:30 PM] Miller: They were def down more than one or he would not intentionally miss that free throw
[3/22/18, 6:05:40 PM] Justin: https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/03/brazil-basketball-buzzer-beater-video-basquete-cearense-paulinho-boracini-franca
[3/22/18, 6:05:43 PM] Justin: maybe this is wrong
[3/22/18, 6:06:04 PM] Miller: Idk, deadspin said down 3 and got intentionally fouled and made the 1st
[3/22/18, 6:06:08 PM] Miller: All of which makes sense
[3/22/18, 6:07:33 PM] Justin: yeh 81-80
[3/22/18, 6:07:37 PM] Justin: ok makes more sense now
[3/22/18, 6:17:50 PM] Scott: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/22/18, 6:36:45 PM] Miller: I read that Blake's sign and was very confused
[3/22/18, 6:36:59 PM] Miller: I wonder if those guys have any idea though
[3/22/18, 6:50:33 PM] Miller: Lol fucked up I just came to a note on my car that said nice parking douche
[3/22/18, 6:53:36 PM] Miller: Now to be fair in hindsight I was parked like an asshole
[3/22/18, 6:54:01 PM] Miller: However when I parked this morning with all the snow nobody could see any of the lines and I parked next to another car and in front from another car
[3/22/18, 6:54:05 PM] Miller: Of course they apparently left
[3/22/18, 6:54:11 PM] Miller: And so now I look like an asshole
[3/22/18, 6:58:25 PM] Tk: To Jats crazy how much snow you guys got hit with. We've been lucky to only be getting the smalls bands of it. It's snowed on and off last 2wks but not heavy enough to stick.
[3/23/18, 9:56:35 AM] Brian Katz: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/23/18, 11:26:29 AM] Justin: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/23/18, 11:28:36 AM] Fberg: didnt trump withdraw support for DACA recipients?
[3/23/18, 11:28:57 AM] Justin: Lol.
[3/23/18, 11:28:59 AM] Fberg: and arent we sending the bill for the wall to Mexico?
[3/23/18, 11:29:53 AM] Justin: there is no way to analyze trump, is pretty hilarious he somehow out maneuvers Democrats on the issue though.
[3/23/18, 11:31:48 AM] Justin: Like he literally just turned it around on them. They spent months saying they wouldn‚Äôt vote for budget without DACA. They were full of shit of course , and then he‚Äôs like I will veto it for you not addressing it. Bizzaro world
[3/23/18, 11:32:10 AM] Fberg: to support Trump, you seriously need to avoid listening to like 99.9% of what is said around the world
[3/23/18, 11:32:37 AM] Justin: That‚Äôs like 80%of America so makes sense
[3/23/18, 11:33:12 AM] Fberg: i flat out listened to Mulvaney say yesterday that if this spending bill passes thru Congress, Trump will sign it
[3/23/18, 11:33:38 AM] Justin: Of course he will
[3/23/18, 11:34:14 AM] Fberg: and now this, why does anyone think that if they work for trump, trump wont throw them under the bus or simply make them look like biggest fools
[3/23/18, 11:34:33 AM] Justin: Assumes they care.
[3/23/18, 11:34:42 AM] Justin: Get accomplished what they want and leave
[3/23/18, 11:35:06 AM] Fberg: but are they really accomplishing anything that cannot be undone when trump is no longer president?
[3/23/18, 11:35:18 AM] Justin: Plenty.
[3/23/18, 11:35:39 AM] Fberg: even these regulations they are throwing away can be re-applied under new administration
[3/23/18, 11:37:08 AM] Justin: Maybe. But I‚Äôm sure it will provide enough case precedent to make for arguments to exemptions.
[3/23/18, 11:38:24 AM] Justin: Just spitballing, I‚Äôm not a lawyer. But if the government says company a you can do this and they do it and hen turns around and sued them for doing it, govt gonna be hard pressed to win that case against some million dollar corporate law teams.
[3/23/18, 11:39:19 AM] Justin: Also idk what it takes to even reestablish epa regulations.
[3/23/18, 11:40:10 AM] Justin: Corporate tax policy can‚Äôt be reversed for at least 10 years and already gonna cripple funding to everything. State dept been dismantled, which isn‚Äôt something you can just build back up.
[3/23/18, 11:41:50 AM] Fberg: each administration sets priorities for agencies to follow
[3/23/18, 11:42:49 AM] Fberg: Reagan and Clinton pushed for more executive oversight over agencies, specifically as to new regulations agencies intended to pass
[3/23/18, 11:43:30 AM] Fberg: Obama continued Clinton's method of oversight and now Trump asserted a 2 for 1 regulation policy
[3/23/18, 11:43:43 AM] Fberg: so it can change according to whoever gets elected
[3/23/18, 11:44:00 AM] Fberg: and regulations always have judicial oversight
[3/23/18, 11:44:53 AM] Fberg: tax policy goes according to whatever congress passes
[3/23/18, 11:45:58 AM] Fberg: if congress had a spine they could actually do something about dimmantling the state dept or any other dept
[3/23/18, 11:46:04 AM] Fberg: but they dont
[3/23/18, 11:47:05 AM] Fberg: executive discretion is not paramount to statute passed by congress
[3/23/18, 11:47:38 AM] Justin: Yeh but it‚Äôs more complicated than that. The public doesn‚Äôt have a desire for regulations.  It‚Äôs difficult to assume a president getting elected on 2 billion in corporate finance is gonna come in and reinstall all these regulations on corporations.
[3/23/18, 11:50:09 AM] Fberg: i dont really mind at this point
[3/23/18, 11:50:26 AM] Fberg: people need to be smacked in the face with reality before it begins to register
[3/23/18, 11:51:11 AM] Justin: But they won‚Äôt be smacked in the face. They don‚Äôt see the future impact.
[3/23/18, 11:51:47 AM] Fberg: promises of manufacturing jobs returning, infrastructure projects, etc.
[3/23/18, 11:52:01 AM] Justin: If anything next democratic president t will have to cut SS and then 30 years from now the same idiots that say he Democrats were the KKK will say the Democrats killed SS
[3/23/18, 11:52:19 AM] Fberg: i dont disagree
[3/23/18, 11:52:47 AM] Fberg: can you just convince your boy bernie to run again
[3/23/18, 11:53:06 AM] Fberg: at minimum, i want to see bernie and DT battle it out
[3/23/18, 11:53:22 AM] Justin: This is more complex as well. He will do this stuff but the same deal. He‚Äôs giving with one hand and taking with the other. He will privately cofinance these things leading to toll roads everywhere. He will also gut unions and give non union shops the rights to these contracts.
[3/23/18, 11:54:02 AM] Justin: But yeh the idea that manufacturing is coming back is a pipe dream
[3/23/18, 11:55:01 AM] Fberg: im not saying its simple, im just saying that if people in Penn, ohio, michigan, wisconsin aren't in a different position then they were when first elected DT, then promises wont seem so great again in 2020
[3/23/18, 11:55:32 AM] Justin: Yeh that‚Äôs because the Mexicans
[3/23/18, 11:55:39 AM] Justin: And Democrats not building a wall
[3/23/18, 11:55:42 AM] Fberg: plus they will have had 4 years of all this nonsense
[3/23/18, 11:56:00 AM] Fberg: the new Sicario movie isnt going to help the Dems
[3/23/18, 11:56:15 AM] Justin: Pumped to see it.
[3/23/18, 11:56:21 AM] Justin: Liked first one lol
[3/23/18, 11:57:00 AM] Fberg: looks really good, but we will eventually find out that Stephen Miller or Bannon wrote the screen play
[3/23/18, 11:57:19 AM] Justin: Lol. Watched promo while back, it look that bad?
[3/23/18, 11:57:21 AM] Fberg: or maybe LP's boy Alex Jones
[3/23/18, 11:57:43 AM] Fberg: yea, its the story about how the mexican cartels smuggled terrorists over the boarder into usa
[3/23/18, 11:57:49 AM] Justin: Lol
[3/23/18, 11:58:07 AM] Justin: Muslim terrorists?
[3/23/18, 11:58:12 AM] Fberg: yes
[3/23/18, 11:58:13 AM] Justin: Because that would just make sense
[3/23/18, 11:58:23 AM] Fberg: they found prayer rugs and everything
[3/23/18, 11:58:36 AM] Justin: Damn really wanted to watch that movie
[3/23/18, 11:59:06 AM] Fberg: wondering if this movie, alone, gets DT re-elected?
[3/23/18, 12:01:41 PM] Justin: Surprised it‚Äôs even getting movie release
[3/23/18, 12:01:50 PM] Justin: Figured was gonna be straight to dvd.
[3/23/18, 3:42:01 PM] Dan Watts: Just went on FB
[3/23/18, 3:42:32 PM] Dan Watts: Apparently Herman wants the ugly chick from sex and the city to be governor
[3/23/18, 3:42:53 PM] Miller: was there a hot one on sex and the city?
[3/23/18, 3:43:28 PM] Dan Watts: Miranda could get it, so could the preppy one
[3/23/18, 4:01:06 PM] Miller: *S&P 500 SINKS 5.9% IN WEEK, BIGGEST DROP IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS
[3/23/18, 4:06:07 PM] Dan Watts: More tariffs!!
[3/23/18, 4:08:06 PM] Fberg: more on China???
[3/23/18, 4:13:44 PM] Justin: maybe stock buybacks shouldn't be the driving force in an economy?
[3/23/18, 4:16:25 PM] Dan Watts: Tarrifs are shit and everyone knows it
[3/23/18, 4:17:44 PM] Dan Watts: #freetradeissexy
[3/23/18, 4:22:58 PM] Justin: lol agreed.  lets import Canadian generic drugs and employ cuban doctors and get rid of all those burdensome regulations making healthcare costs so high.  Lets eliminate copyright laws while were at it.
[3/23/18, 4:23:39 PM] Justin: ill be all about a real free market, i doubt the s&p would though
[3/23/18, 4:25:09 PM] Dan Watts: Copyright has intellectual property and I wouldn't associate that with economic regulation
[3/23/18, 4:25:21 PM] Dan Watts: Copyright is*
[3/23/18, 4:26:21 PM] Justin: I mean its literally the biggest barrier to development of a market
[3/23/18, 4:27:11 PM] Dan Watts: Disagree
[3/23/18, 4:27:21 PM] Justin: unless you think guaranteeing a monopoly on property somehow matures a market
[3/23/18, 4:27:38 PM] Justin: i guess comapnies are really incentivized during the 7 years to make their product better
[3/23/18, 4:27:58 PM] Justin: when noone can actually sell their idea let alone their product
[3/23/18, 4:28:32 PM] Justin: and considering i think they just extended the parhmi ipr rights to something like 15 years
[3/23/18, 4:28:34 PM] Dan Watts: This is commie thinking
[3/23/18, 4:28:46 PM] Justin: lol
[3/23/18, 4:28:58 PM] Dan Watts: If you create something it should be yours and not stolen from you
[3/23/18, 4:29:03 PM] Justin: no its just a really big contradcition in free market rhetoric
[3/23/18, 4:29:10 PM] Justin: and who does that?
[3/23/18, 4:29:15 PM] Justin: makes sure shit isnt stolen form you?
[3/23/18, 4:29:47 PM] Justin: the answer : communists
[3/23/18, 4:32:33 PM] Dan Watts: Communists take shit you've earned and redistribute it
[3/23/18, 4:33:25 PM] Justin: so your saying governments role is to create conditions for corporations to thrive, but not for indivudals to thrive?
[3/23/18, 4:34:32 PM] Justin: or put better, your fine with government using coercive force to enforce something like IPR(not a real thing), but not fine with it doign something like protecting jobs thru tarrifs(real things)
[3/23/18, 4:34:33 PM] Dan Watts: That's not what I'm saying
[3/23/18, 4:35:03 PM] Dan Watts: Governments role is make sure laws are enforced and order is maintained
[3/23/18, 4:35:14 PM] Justin: your fine with IPR laws that artifically pump of the price of goods, but not fine with tarrifs that do the same
[3/23/18, 4:35:35 PM] Justin: and what exactly is a tarrif?
[3/23/18, 4:36:24 PM] Fberg: isnt this what Watts was saying?  im confused
[3/23/18, 4:37:11 PM] Justin: what is a tarrif? what are IPR laws?
[3/23/18, 4:37:16 PM] Miller: You just quoted watts, so yea that is probably what he was saying
[3/23/18, 4:37:19 PM] Justin: there literally the smae fucken thing
[3/23/18, 4:37:36 PM] Fberg: that was my poiint millz
[3/23/18, 4:37:52 PM] Fberg: im confused how all that other stuff was assumed from what watts literally said
[3/23/18, 4:37:57 PM] Justin: punative damage for performing an eocnomic activity
[3/23/18, 4:38:07 PM] Justin: #freetradeissexy
[3/23/18, 4:38:18 PM] Justin: overnments role is make sure laws are enforced and order is maintained
[3/23/18, 4:38:33 PM] Fberg: he said that too
[3/23/18, 4:38:35 PM] Justin: Copyright has intellectual property and I wouldn't associate that with economic regulation
[3/23/18, 4:38:41 PM] Justin: he siad all these things
[3/23/18, 4:38:47 PM] Justin: Copyright has intellectual property and I wouldn't associate that with economic regulation
[3/23/18, 4:38:48 PM] Justin: Copyright has intellectual property and I wouldn't associate that with economic regulation
[3/23/18, 4:38:49 PM] Justin: Copyright has intellectual property and I wouldn't associate that with economic regulation
[3/23/18, 4:39:04 PM] Miller: Say it louder
[3/23/18, 4:39:35 PM] Justin: anotherwords intellectual property, an intangible thing is essentially elevated to anatural law
[3/23/18, 4:39:40 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/23/18, 4:39:44 PM] Fberg: without "lol" i dont know how to react
[3/23/18, 4:39:53 PM] Justin: when it in fact is clearly economic regulation, to create incentive to invent things
[3/23/18, 4:40:46 PM] Fberg: personal gain seems like a good incentive to create
[3/23/18, 4:40:47 PM] Launchpad: so what are you arguing?
[3/23/18, 4:41:03 PM] Justin: you can't have it both ways is all i'm saying.  You cant rally against trade tarrifs and then pretend that IPR laws arent somehow  government created and enforced
[3/23/18, 4:41:26 PM] Launchpad: the only incentive anyone should ever need to create is through government coercision
[3/23/18, 4:41:31 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/23/18, 4:41:47 PM] Justin: so then we dont need ipr laws?
[3/23/18, 4:42:07 PM] Fberg: i wont gain if everyone steals my idea
[3/23/18, 4:42:18 PM] Fberg: its needs protection
[3/23/18, 4:42:19 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/23/18, 4:43:07 PM] Justin: ok that protection is provided by government
[3/23/18, 4:43:18 PM] Fberg: blend of capitalism and protectionism
[3/23/18, 4:43:24 PM] Justin: just like a tarrif provides protection
[3/23/18, 4:43:50 PM] Fberg: i dont disagree with the tariffs on china
[3/23/18, 4:44:06 PM] Justin: thats fair, tis not about diasreement or agreement though
[3/23/18, 4:44:14 PM] Fberg: i have no faith that trumps oversight on this will benefit us, probably him and his kind
[3/23/18, 4:44:18 PM] Justin: its about inconsistent logic
[3/23/18, 4:44:30 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/23/18, 4:44:46 PM] Fberg: cant have purely capitalist society, doesnt exist
[3/23/18, 4:44:46 PM] Justin: and you cant say you are for IPR laws but against tarrifs without being contradictory
[3/23/18, 4:44:57 PM] Fberg: except in rand paul's mind maybe
[3/23/18, 4:44:58 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/23/18, 4:45:05 PM] Justin: if you address that contradiction, sure.  but to pretend they arent the same thing
[3/23/18, 4:45:12 PM] Fberg: there are degrees of agreement
[3/23/18, 4:45:33 PM] Fberg: agree with laws that protect IP, sure, agree with certain tariffs, sure
[3/23/18, 4:45:56 PM] Justin: yeh but im not asking about your take on IPR and tarrifs, just pointing out that they are in fact the same mechanism
[3/23/18, 4:46:12 PM] Justin: so when summoning the " free amrket" thats bullshit argument
[3/23/18, 4:46:21 PM] Fberg: but what happens with another country doesnt respect your IP laws?
[3/23/18, 4:46:23 PM] Justin: there is nothing free amrket about IPR laws
[3/23/18, 4:46:46 PM] Justin: fberg im in agreement with you as to the purpose of IPR.  Apprently the purpose of tarrifs as well
[3/23/18, 4:47:11 PM] Fberg: i dont think the free market solves all problems
[3/23/18, 4:47:15 PM] Justin: thats why we have trade agreements to create enforcement mechanisms for IPR laws
[3/23/18, 4:47:26 PM] Fberg: but does indicate
[3/23/18, 4:47:33 PM] Justin: all the more a point of why they are the same fucken thing as tarrifs, becuase the retalitory mechanisms are actually tarrifs
[3/23/18, 4:48:00 PM] Fberg: thats why Trump is MAGA
[3/23/18, 4:48:07 PM] Justin: IPR laws are a standard for tarrif enforcement
[3/23/18, 4:48:45 PM] Fberg: we did have to know that these tariffs were coming, dude campaigned on this
[3/23/18, 4:50:12 PM] Justin: true as well
[3/23/18, 4:50:32 PM] Justin: i dont have  a position on the tarrifs, kinda the least of americas problems right now

[3/23/18, 5:41:13 PM] Launchpad: they don't have a mobile app
[3/23/18, 5:41:16 PM] Justin: Althoug clearly this Facebook shit has a deeper see state element too it, not purely financial
[3/23/18, 5:41:37 PM] Justin: Deep state*

[3/26/18, 12:02:01 PM] Fberg: i watched all of the episodes one night, agree, hilarious and scary considering how young we were when this aired
[3/26/18, 12:09:14 PM] Donk: yeah, you cant go back and watch any tv from back then without being shocked at some of the content/stereotypes/casual misgony/racism/homophobia
[3/26/18, 12:12:15 PM] Fberg: zack morris was essentially donald trump in high school
[3/26/18, 12:12:51 PM] Fberg: womanizer, made money off everyone he knew without giving a fuck, used everyone around him for personal gain
[3/26/18, 12:29:37 PM] Launchpad: obviously things were exaggerated for comedic affect but still pretty damn hilarious
[3/26/18, 2:08:07 PM] Miller: hypothetical question (nicole did not leave me yet)
[3/26/18, 2:08:13 PM] Miller: if 2 people are married
[3/26/18, 2:08:27 PM] Miller: and someone leaves and moves out
[3/26/18, 2:08:42 PM] Miller: is it "cheating" if the other person then hooks up with someone else?
[3/26/18, 2:08:48 PM] Miller: (obviously still legally married)
[3/26/18, 2:09:20 PM] Brian Katz: Not if the relationship is over, and you‚Äôre just waiting for a divorce.
[3/26/18, 2:09:52 PM] Brian Katz: If you‚Äôre trying to work through things then yes
[3/26/18, 2:12:01 PM] Justin: Clearly they are on a break
[3/26/18, 2:12:07 PM] Miller: the people who moved out are not talking on a day-day basis and do not have an amicable relationship
[3/26/18, 2:12:33 PM] Brian Katz: If they‚Äôre trying to work it out then yes. If not then no.
[3/26/18, 2:13:00 PM] Justin: Yeh doesn‚Äôt seem all that complicated from a non legal standpoint
[3/26/18, 2:13:42 PM] Miller: i dont think its cheating personally, someone else i was talking to said they thought it was and was surprised i would not think it was
[3/26/18, 2:13:49 PM] Miller: so figured i would pose the question to see if i was crazy
[3/26/18, 2:14:38 PM] Brian Katz: I didn‚Äôt think cheese was cheating when he was sleeping with that chick while he was at his grandmas house.
[3/26/18, 2:15:17 PM] Justin: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EyCiE0CszGo
[3/26/18, 2:17:15 PM] Scott: kara nad i were divorced in june
[3/26/18, 2:17:18 PM] Scott: or may i can't remember
[3/26/18, 2:17:20 PM] Scott: i was sleeping with taryn before that
[3/26/18, 2:18:14 PM] Scott: kara and i were completely finished
[3/26/18, 2:18:23 PM] Scott: legally speaking it can take years for a divroce to be finalized, ppl dont wait that long
[3/26/18, 2:19:20 PM] Miller: yea your situation was more clear, in this case neither party has 100% decided on divorce
[3/26/18, 2:19:25 PM] Miller: but also not actively working on anything
[3/26/18, 2:19:29 PM] Donk: I dont think this is a one size fits alll situation
[3/26/18, 2:19:38 PM] Donk: I think it depends om tbe couple
[3/26/18, 2:19:48 PM] Donk: And groundrules established
[3/26/18, 2:20:08 PM] Scott: completely depends on the situation
[3/26/18, 2:20:09 PM] Brian Katz: Unless you say otherwise you shouldn‚Äôt see other people if you haven‚Äôt decided on divorce.
[3/26/18, 2:20:37 PM] Scott: lets say for example you are contemplating divorce, relationship not over, husband goes and cheats, wife cna use that as "adultery" reason fro divorce and it be contested
[3/26/18, 2:20:40 PM] Scott: you gotta watch your shit
[3/26/18, 2:21:00 PM] Miller: i didnt think adultery mattered in terms of divorce?
[3/26/18, 2:21:05 PM] Scott: in my situation i was completely clear, i also realized she was dating a coupl emonths after we split (saw her on dating app), so it completely depends
[3/26/18, 2:21:06 PM] Miller: or does it depend on the state?
[3/26/18, 2:21:09 PM] Scott: it deos
[3/26/18, 2:21:10 PM] Scott: does
[3/26/18, 2:21:25 PM] Scott: new york recognizes no fault divorce, like a no fault car accident, but both parties have to consent
[3/26/18, 2:21:59 PM] Scott: otherwise you have to give a reason for divorc,e adultery being one of them, and that hurts the adulterer because, int he absolute least, judge's aren't going to give an adulterer deference on certain things
[3/26/18, 2:22:15 PM] Justin: Yeh think this is obviously a complicated legal question, but moral issue not so much
[3/26/18, 2:22:27 PM] Scott: legally speaking
[3/26/18, 2:22:29 PM] Miller: Does Adultery Impact Alimony in New York?
Marital fault, which includes adultery, is not commonly considered by the court when awarding alimony and in dividing marital property.
[3/26/18, 2:22:32 PM] Scott: keep your dick in your pants until papers are filed
[3/26/18, 2:22:48 PM] Scott: once they are filed, you are in the clear
[3/26/18, 2:22:55 PM] Launchpad: but would a judge consider that adultery if the 2 haven't talked in a month and are living separately?
[3/26/18, 2:23:06 PM] Scott: and yes, it doens't make a direct differnece, like i said, if one party is to get deference on a certain issue, it wont be the adulterer
[3/26/18, 2:23:08 PM] Launchpad: Better alternative -- don't get married
[3/26/18, 2:23:21 PM] Brian Katz: Scotty out of no where
[3/26/18, 2:23:24 PM] Scott: in theory adultery is adultery until papers are filed.
[3/26/18, 2:23:35 PM] Scott: my papers were filed within weeks
[3/26/18, 2:25:16 PM] Scott: @15166335046 where does this all stem from?
[3/26/18, 2:25:37 PM] Miller: 2 people i know have separated
[3/26/18, 2:25:53 PM] Scott: u know if they are trying to work it out at all?
[3/26/18, 2:26:04 PM] Miller: unclear but i do not think so
[3/26/18, 2:26:18 PM] Scott: gotya
[3/26/18, 6:35:41 PM] Miller: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/sports/saints-cheerleader.html
[3/26/18, 6:35:43 PM] Miller: According to the Saints‚Äô handbook for cheerleaders, as well as internal emails and text messages reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with Davis, the Saints have an anti-fraternization policy that requires cheerleaders to avoid contact with players, in person or online, even though players are not penalized for pursuing such engagement with cheerleaders. The cheerleaders must block players from following them on social media and cannot post photos of themselves in Saints gear, denying them the chance to market themselves. The players are not required to do any of these things.

Cheerleaders are told not to dine in the same restaurant as players, or speak to them in any detail. If a Saints cheerleader enters a restaurant and a player is already there, she must leave. If a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player arrives afterward, she must leave. There are nearly 2,000 players in the N.F.L., and many of them use pseudonyms on social media. Cheerleaders must find a way to block each one, while players have no limits on who can follow them.

[3/27/18, 10:01:07 AM] Miller: is this common knowledge?
[3/27/18, 10:01:22 AM] Launchpad: very common
[3/27/18, 10:01:47 AM] Brian Katz: It‚Äôs a stupid avatar app
[3/27/18, 10:02:07 AM] Miller: its an app where you make a cartoon of yourself?
[3/27/18, 10:02:17 AM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/27/18, 10:02:39 AM] Miller: that is supposed to be you?

[3/27/18, 10:03:09 AM] Launchpad: i know thats weak lol

[3/27/18, 10:04:52 AM] Miller: so this app turns you 2 into the same cartoon?
[3/27/18, 10:05:20 AM] Miller: so it has worse technology than the guy on the boardwalk who just draws everyone the same charictauture
[3/27/18, 10:05:40 AM] Miller: so this is a thing why?
[3/27/18, 10:09:51 AM] Launchpad: lol no you create your own
[3/27/18, 10:10:57 AM] Launchpad: then you use all the template with your avatar on it
[3/27/18, 10:11:38 AM] Miller: theres no way this is a thing adults do, this has to be like a tweenager thing
[3/27/18, 10:12:01 AM] Launchpad: it was a thing like 2 years ago
[3/27/18, 10:12:06 AM] Miller: i assume there is no point to it, like can you explain to me why you would ever want to do this?
[3/27/18, 10:12:14 AM] Launchpad: big on snapchat
[3/27/18, 10:12:30 AM] Launchpad: I can't explain to you a lot of things
[3/27/18, 10:13:00 AM] Miller: i mean if something has any remotely usefulness i feel like it can be explained pretty simply
[3/27/18, 10:16:06 AM] Brian Katz: Mad adults do this

[3/27/18, 10:17:20 AM] Miller: not adults
[3/27/18, 10:18:55 AM] Donk: youd be surprised how many adults do this bitmoji thing
[3/27/18, 10:19:15 AM] Donk: liz's mom and aunts constantly use them in texts to each other
[3/27/18, 10:19:23 AM] Miller: i already am surprised at the fact it is more than 1

[3/27/18, 10:20:10 AM] Kiyoon: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/27/18, 10:20:27 AM] Miller: also eating tide pods is easily explainable motivation-wise, people want internet/viral fame so they do stupid shit in order to try to achieve that (such as setting themselves on fire)
[3/27/18, 10:20:32 AM] Miller: also tide pods look delicious
[3/27/18, 10:20:52 AM] Miller: im asusming tom cruise there is supposed to be you?

[3/27/18, 3:25:51 PM] Miller: no
[3/27/18, 3:26:01 PM] Miller: he asked a terribly worded question
[3/27/18, 3:26:03 PM] Donk: she never came back from that knockout
[3/27/18, 3:26:10 PM] Miller: she thought he was literally asking her if she could time travel
[3/27/18, 3:26:12 PM] Miller: which she cannot
[3/27/18, 3:26:14 PM] Justin: no she didnt
[3/27/18, 3:26:15 PM] Justin: lol

[3/27/18, 3:28:11 PM] Justin: becuase she said she isnt retired , his response was oh you can go back in time
[3/27/18, 3:28:16 PM] Justin: come on miller
[3/27/18, 3:28:19 PM] Miller: so there is a possibility that you could....go back...in time?
[3/27/18, 3:28:35 PM] Justin: it was a really dumb question, he realized he fucked up
[3/27/18, 3:28:44 PM] Justin: and tried to reword it, and she wasnt having it
[3/27/18, 3:28:47 PM] Miller: why would she be annoyed by him asking her if she would ever fight again in the future?
[3/27/18, 3:28:58 PM] Justin: he didnt do that
[3/27/18, 3:29:09 PM] Miller: that is 100% what he was TRYING to ask
[3/27/18, 3:29:13 PM] Justin: he said oh youre gonna go back in time and fight.....implying she cnat fight now
[3/27/18, 3:29:23 PM] Justin: to which he corrected his wording
[3/27/18, 3:29:32 PM] Justin: too which she was alreaddy angry, im over this lol
[3/27/18, 3:29:35 PM] Miller: herm you are like only 1 step ahead of ronda rousey here in your ability to interpret wtf is going on
[3/27/18, 3:29:40 PM] Justin: play by play on 25 second ronda rousey video
[3/27/18, 3:29:42 PM] Miller: he did not mean GO BACK IN TIME
[3/27/18, 3:29:49 PM] Justin: lasted longer than her last fight
[3/27/18, 3:29:53 PM] Miller: he meant in time as in the expression
[3/27/18, 3:29:55 PM] Justin: might alsted longer than all her fights
[3/27/18, 3:30:13 PM] Miller: just like there is the possibility that in time you could figure out wtf is going on here
[3/27/18, 3:30:20 PM] Justin: lol
[3/27/18, 3:30:26 PM] Justin: im curious other peoples take now
[3/27/18, 3:30:32 PM] Justin: we firmly planted both sdies of the debate
[3/27/18, 3:31:31 PM] Miller: ive watched it 10 times and i am 150% certain golic was not asking her a question about time travel
[3/27/18, 3:33:11 PM] Donk: yeah golic just worded the question terribly
[3/27/18, 3:33:17 PM] Donk: he was not asking her about time travel lol
[3/27/18, 3:33:25 PM] Miller: https://deadspin.com/ronda-rousey-misunderstands-question-gets-all-cranky-a-1824111011
[3/27/18, 3:33:27 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/27/18, 3:33:30 PM] Justin: was her repsonse about time travel confusion or annoyance?
[3/27/18, 3:33:34 PM] Justin: thtas the heart of the question
[3/27/18, 3:33:38 PM] Miller: the "in time" was seperate not "go back in time"
[3/27/18, 3:33:48 PM] Miller: he meant go back to octagon....in time ( as in at some point in the future)
[3/27/18, 3:34:08 PM] Miller: he response was annoyance about being thinking she was being asked about time travel
[3/27/18, 3:34:11 PM] Justin: that title seems to agree with me
[3/27/18, 3:34:19 PM] Justin: nah thats where we disagre
[3/27/18, 3:34:20 PM] Miller: it does not
[3/27/18, 3:34:36 PM] Launchpad: in a rare move Im siding with herman on this
[3/27/18, 3:34:39 PM] Justin: article content doesnt
[3/27/18, 3:34:46 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/27/18, 3:34:53 PM] Launchpad: she was condescending because it was akwardly worded
[3/27/18, 3:35:03 PM] Miller: that is not hermans point
[3/27/18, 3:35:14 PM] Miller: herman thinks golic actually really did mean to ask her about going back in time (aka time travel)
[3/27/18, 3:35:17 PM] Justin: 100% is my point
[3/27/18, 3:35:22 PM] Justin: no i dont
[3/27/18, 3:35:40 PM] Justin: i think Rousey understood what he meant and repsonded to his misword because she was pissed at him
[3/27/18, 3:36:11 PM] Miller: he was not talking about going BACK IN TIME like time traveling back
[3/27/18, 3:36:22 PM] Miller: at no point was anything golic said relating to time travel
[3/27/18, 3:36:32 PM] Justin: thats why shes angry
[3/27/18, 3:36:36 PM] Justin: and condescending
[3/27/18, 3:36:44 PM] Miller: shes angry b/c he was not talking about time travel?!
[3/27/18, 3:36:55 PM] Justin: shes angry because he implies shes washed up and cant fight again
[3/27/18, 3:37:02 PM] Miller: that isnt what he is implying
[3/27/18, 3:37:08 PM] Miller: b/c that isnt his question
[3/27/18, 3:37:18 PM] Miller: his question is literally will you at any point in the future return to ufc to fight
[3/27/18, 3:37:19 PM] Miller: that is it
[3/27/18, 3:37:46 PM] Justin: ok so asking when you knew you were done has nothign to do with the past
[3/27/18, 3:37:48 PM] Miller: (notice despite me saying future i am not asking if she can time travel into the future to fight in UFC in 2080)
[3/27/18, 3:38:01 PM] Justin: im well over this
[3/27/18, 3:38:13 PM] Justin: he implyed to her shes dones nad over in several different ways
[3/27/18, 3:38:22 PM] Miller: "hey when did you know you were done with UFC?"
"i have never said i am done with UFC"
"so you might fight again in the future?"
[3/27/18, 3:38:35 PM] Miller: is how that should have gone if a non-mouth-breathing-idiot was asking the questions
[3/27/18, 3:38:40 PM] Justin: said something really stupid by mistake about time travel, she could have let it go and answered the question, but she was pissed at him and therefore gave a condescending answer about time travel
[3/27/18, 3:38:41 PM] Miller: instead we got........this
[3/27/18, 3:38:51 PM] Miller: dude he said NOTHING ABOUT TIME TRAVEL
[3/27/18, 3:38:54 PM] Justin: yes
[3/27/18, 3:39:07 PM] Miller: i am in fact willing to wager in the history of his radio career golic has never once talked about time travel
[3/27/18, 3:39:27 PM] Justin: lol
[3/27/18, 3:39:52 PM] Justin: got work to do, im scraping NYT for references to BLM, maybe ill scrape it for references to time travel and Golic
[3/27/18, 3:40:31 PM] Miller: herm and LP vs me and donk
[3/27/18, 3:40:34 PM] Miller: someone break the tie
[3/27/18, 5:48:31 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/27/18, 6:26:18 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[3/27/18, 6:28:51 PM] Miller: Sounds like @16316620763
[3/27/18, 6:34:45 PM] Fberg: Rousey also gave Max Kellerman a difficult time about the same issue, without reference to time travel, if it matters
[3/27/18, 6:35:05 PM] Fberg: In a interview she did later today
[3/27/18, 6:35:14 PM] Miller: No doubt she's a notoriously bad interview
[3/27/18, 6:35:23 PM] Miller: Like migos bad
[3/27/18, 6:35:50 PM] Miller: Doesn't change my opinion that golic was in no way referencing actual time travel and just worded it horribly
[3/27/18, 6:36:20 PM] Fberg: I agree with that statement, he allowed the pause between words way too long
[3/27/18, 6:37:13 PM] Fberg: And Rousey seems like a bitch so she was already annoyed, probably because she use to be legit and is now acting in WWF
[3/27/18, 6:37:44 PM] Miller: It's very awkward phrasing you should never use in time at the end of that sentence
[3/27/18, 6:38:03 PM] Miller: I'm actually not sure in time should ever be used at the end of a sentence
[3/27/18, 6:39:03 PM] Fberg: It was a question from a meat head jock essentially. Rousey needs to lighten up about her past.
[3/27/18, 6:39:25 PM] Fberg: She‚Äôs about to be taken much less seriously in general.

[3/28/18, 3:43:30 PM] Launchpad: lol
[3/28/18, 3:43:40 PM] Launchpad: whats his wonderlic
[3/28/18, 4:32:10 PM] Justin: still pretty accurate
[3/28/18, 4:33:59 PM] Justin: i mean objectively your right, but practicality even based off a true story its still  a pretty unlikely event for a random kid
[3/28/18, 4:35:26 PM] Justin: unlikely being somehwere in the 1 in the billions, so don't be mocking the # 2 overall 2018 league of extraordinary gentlemen consesnsus pick
[3/28/18, 4:36:24 PM] Miller: i will mock whomever i choose
[3/28/18, 4:36:34 PM] Miller: phrasing it that way implies you dont realize it was a true story
[3/28/18, 4:36:46 PM] Donk: i doubt 1 in the billions
[3/28/18, 4:37:23 PM] Miller: a cruise ship sank the other day, it was just like if that movie titanic was a true story
[3/28/18, 4:38:41 PM] Launchpad: I recently ate dinner with my 3 clones, it was just like if that movie Multiplicity was a true story
[3/28/18, 4:39:49 PM] Justin: ok you show me where he says that and eosnt say it was was if the blind side came true
[3/28/18, 4:40:44 PM] Justin: idk im not disagreeing with you
[3/28/18, 4:40:46 PM] Miller: if he had not used the word movie i would let it slide
[3/28/18, 4:40:59 PM] Kiyoon: Gonna agree with Herman here and say it came true for him
[3/28/18, 4:41:06 PM] Justin: just saying when you think of impossibel events your like it was like that impossible event came true
[3/28/18, 4:41:45 PM] Justin: yeh but i get i inferring that
[3/28/18, 4:42:46 PM] Justin: Like i coudlnt imagine being a billionare, wildest dream come true.  does that imply there arent billionaires?
[3/28/18, 4:43:23 PM] Justin: im not as confident in this one as Rousey lol so ill leave it at that
[3/28/18, 4:43:42 PM] Miller: thats not good b/c you were 120% wrong on the rousey one lol
[3/28/18, 4:43:47 PM] Miller: im over it
[3/28/18, 4:43:49 PM] Miller: NEXT
[3/28/18, 4:43:50 PM] Justin: damn
[3/28/18, 4:43:53 PM] Miller: christoper nolan movie ranks, my list is correct and i will fight you

Memento
The Dark Knight
The Prestige
Inception 
Batman Begins
Interstellar 
The Dark Knight Rises 
Dunkirk
Insomnia
[3/28/18, 4:43:58 PM] Justin: im super wrong these dats
[3/28/18, 4:44:10 PM] Justin: presitge over inception?
[3/28/18, 4:44:22 PM] Justin: havnet seen dunkirk
[3/28/18, 4:44:24 PM] Miller: i think so, its close to be fair
[3/28/18, 4:44:45 PM] Justin: and while al pacino couldnt sleep, i got some sleep during his movie
[3/28/18, 4:44:46 PM] Kiyoon: switch Inception with Memento and you got it
[3/28/18, 4:45:26 PM] Kiyoon: Nolan has some pretty good movies
[3/28/18, 4:45:30 PM] Miller: blasphemy
[3/28/18, 4:45:42 PM] Miller: insomnia the only one i didnt like on that list
[3/28/18, 4:45:53 PM] Miller: the 2nd-worst one was still really good
[3/28/18, 4:45:58 PM] Kiyoon: I thought Interstellar was really good too
[3/28/18, 4:46:17 PM] Miller: nolan+michael caine = undefeated
[3/28/18, 4:49:25 PM] Launchpad: can you do Darren Aronofsky next?
[3/28/18, 4:50:23 PM] Miller: The Wrestler
Requiem for a Dream
Black Swan
Mother!
[3/28/18, 4:50:37 PM] Donk: you forgot the fountain
[3/28/18, 4:50:42 PM] Miller: never seen it
[3/28/18, 4:50:51 PM] Miller: so that was intentional
[3/28/18, 4:51:31 PM] Miller: mother was weird/pretty terrible, black swan weird/massively overrated, requiem for a dream is weird/super depressing
[3/28/18, 4:51:37 PM] Miller: wrestler only one of those i liked
[3/28/18, 4:51:51 PM] Donk: also, nolan is as follows for me- memento>batman begins>dark knight>inception>prestige>dunkirk>insomnia>instellar>dark knight rise
[3/28/18, 4:52:01 PM] Donk: requiem is so good though
[3/28/18, 4:52:05 PM] Miller: what kind of formatting is that donk
[3/28/18, 4:52:06 PM] Donk: but super sad and depsressing
[3/28/18, 4:52:21 PM] Miller: its not a movie i ever wanted to watch again so loses points for that
[3/28/18, 4:52:24 PM] Miller: re-watchability is 0
[3/28/18, 4:52:34 PM] Donk: but that doesnt mean its not a better movie
[3/28/18, 4:52:42 PM] Miller: to me it does, im not a film critic
[3/28/18, 4:52:49 PM] Donk: for example schindlers list is a fantastic movie, but i dont want to watch it agin
[3/28/18, 4:53:05 PM] Donk: this is similiar to when you were tyring to say that last drake album was better than kendricks
[3/28/18, 4:53:11 PM] Donk: basically the same arguement
[3/28/18, 4:53:28 PM] Miller: life is beautiful is a really sad movie but ive seen it a few times, i think it is re-watchable
[3/28/18, 4:54:10 PM] Donk: which btw, that hot taek has aged horribly lol
[3/28/18, 4:54:19 PM] Miller: disagree on both
[3/28/18, 4:54:22 PM] Brian Katz: After looking at that list, nolan blows.
[3/28/18, 4:54:32 PM] Miller: i stand by that taek and still agree today
[3/28/18, 4:54:51 PM] Donk: you are probably like one of five drake-stans with that opinion
[3/28/18, 4:55:07 PM] Donk: one of the hardest directors to rank would david fincher
[3/28/18, 4:55:07 PM] Miller: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[3/28/18, 4:55:13 PM] Donk: soooo many great movies to choose from
[3/28/18, 4:55:33 PM] Miller: all i know is zodiac is at the bottom
[3/28/18, 4:55:34 PM] Miller: fuck that movie
[3/28/18, 4:55:38 PM] Launchpad: Definitely rewatchable, considering the shock factor is not as strong
[3/28/18, 4:55:47 PM] Donk: ah, i really like zodiac
[3/28/18, 4:55:52 PM] Launchpad: you also forgot Pi
[3/28/18, 4:56:14 PM] Miller: never seen it either so intentional as well
[3/28/18, 4:56:25 PM] Donk: pi is nuts
[3/28/18, 4:56:32 PM] Launchpad: Requiem is on top, one of the best movies ever
[3/28/18, 4:56:56 PM] Donk: if i had to give a crack to the nolan movies, it owuld be something like Fight Club>Seven>
[3/28/18, 4:56:59 PM] Miller: zodiac is like the one movie that film nerds argue is amazing (like @18457500957 ) but was one of the worst movies ive ever seen
[3/28/18, 4:57:01 PM] Donk: ooops
[3/28/18, 4:57:05 PM] Donk: let me retry that
[3/28/18, 4:57:09 PM] Miller: i saw 3 people walk out of the theather
[3/28/18, 4:57:12 PM] Miller: and i was jealous of them
[3/28/18, 4:57:27 PM] Donk: fight club>seven>social netowrk>zodiac>the game>etc etc
[3/28/18, 4:57:32 PM] Miller: one guy amusingly shouted out im the fucking zodiac killer on his way out
[3/28/18, 4:57:54 PM] Donk: and i meant the finchr movies, not nolan
[3/28/18, 4:58:21 PM] Miller: zodiac is like someone submitted a traditional murder thriller but forgot to send over the ending
[3/28/18, 4:59:20 PM] Miller: probably top 3 least satisfying ending of all time
[3/28/18, 5:00:50 PM] Donk: it was a movie aobut the zodiac killer, who they never caught, so i dont know what more you were expecting from the ending
[3/28/18, 5:01:15 PM] Donk: A Robert Durst-esque confession though would have been great
[3/28/18, 5:01:41 PM] Miller: before i went to go see it i did not know it was based on a true story
[3/28/18, 5:01:51 PM] Miller: i did not know anything about the zodiac killer
[3/28/18, 5:01:52 PM] Miller: i went to go see a movie
[3/28/18, 5:02:02 PM] Miller: then they go off on this whole build up and this whole serial killer story
[3/28/18, 5:02:26 PM] Miller: and then at the end theyre just like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ idk could be this guy, could be some other guy
[3/28/18, 5:04:59 PM] Launchpad: For the titanic to sail off into the distance before finally reaching its destination
[3/28/18, 5:06:09 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dWgRfb17-M just watched the trailer again
[3/28/18, 5:06:27 PM] Miller: explain to me how without previously knowing this was based on a true story/serial killer anyone is supposed to get that from the trailer
[3/28/18, 5:07:07 PM] Miller: im sorry were you guys around in the 60s and 70s when this was going on? i was too busy not being born yet so somehow i must have missed it
[3/28/18, 5:07:23 PM] Miller: did you take famous serial killers in HS?
[3/28/18, 5:07:29 PM] Miller: my school did not offer that
[3/28/18, 5:08:37 PM] Scott: wrestler was a pretty good movie
[3/28/18, 5:09:23 PM] Launchpad: if you're looking for a happy ending Im sure Disney has a few for you
[3/28/18, 5:09:53 PM] Miller: i would like AN ending
[3/28/18, 5:10:10 PM] Miller: if i go watch a 2 hour movie about a serial killer, i sure as fuck want to know who the fuck the killer was by the end of it
[3/28/18, 5:11:22 PM] Launchpad: oh the irony
[3/28/18, 5:11:31 PM] Donk: lol
[3/28/18, 5:11:37 PM] Donk: got em
[3/28/18, 5:11:39 PM] Miller: please explain how that is ironic
[3/28/18, 5:12:09 PM] Donk: you laugh at a guy for not konwing a movie was based on a real story, but then hate on a movie because you didnt know it was based on a real story?
[3/28/18, 5:12:12 PM] Donk: seems ironic to me
[3/28/18, 5:12:45 PM] Launchpad: I think he also needs us to explain hypocrisy
[3/28/18, 5:12:48 PM] Brian Katz: They had four separate accounts of how the zodiac killer did his crimes, based on eye witnesses
[3/28/18, 5:13:26 PM] Brian Katz: You know they never caught the guy, why would you think they would in the movie
[3/28/18, 5:13:43 PM] Miller: wait zodiac is based on a true story?
[3/28/18, 5:14:21 PM] Miller: ironic would be if i said wow it would be awesome if that movie the zodiac had been based on a true story
[3/28/18, 5:14:45 PM] Miller: i promise you every poster and trailer for the blind side says BASED ON THE TRUE STORY
[3/28/18, 5:14:56 PM] Miller: not to mention everyone knew who michael oher was b/c it was all over tv/news
[3/28/18, 5:15:01 PM] Miller: and it happend like 5 years ago
[3/28/18, 5:15:04 PM] Miller: not 40 years ago
[3/28/18, 5:15:35 PM] Launchpad: He was 11 when the movie came out
[3/28/18, 5:16:06 PM] Miller: wait they never caught the guy?
[3/28/18, 5:16:07 PM] Miller: i was -30 when the zodiac was killing people
[3/28/18, 5:16:26 PM] Launchpad: what you're saying is you've never heard of the Zodiac killer
[3/28/18, 5:16:36 PM] Launchpad: Do you know who Charles Manson is?
[3/28/18, 5:16:40 PM] Donk: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/28/18, 5:16:48 PM] Miller: yes thank you for cracking the case, that is what i am saying
[3/28/18, 5:17:00 PM] Miller: i have heard of charles manson yes
[3/28/18, 5:17:11 PM] Miller: not one mention in the trailer
[3/28/18, 5:17:12 PM] Miller: go watch it
[3/28/18, 5:17:24 PM] Miller: im supposed to be scrutinizing movie posters now
[3/28/18, 5:17:26 PM] Donk: you said poster, i showed you a poster
[3/28/18, 5:17:31 PM] Donk: dont move the goalposts
[3/28/18, 5:17:36 PM] Launchpad: So basically you don't want to admit you're wrong so you're doubling down on your case
[3/28/18, 5:17:41 PM] Miller: i would bet 25%+ of ppl who went to go see the zodiac movie had no idea it was based on a true story
[3/28/18, 5:17:54 PM] Donk: and 50% of the country voted for trump, so?
[3/28/18, 5:17:55 PM] Brian Katz: I wanna say the zodiac killer was way more infamous than the blind side
[3/28/18, 5:17:55 PM] Brian Katz: So what, I was -40 when hitler was killing Jews. Still heard about it.
[3/28/18, 5:17:56 PM] Miller: i would be < 1% of people went to go see the blind side not knowing it was based on a true story
[3/28/18, 5:18:11 PM] Miller: presumably in school
[3/28/18, 5:18:18 PM] Miller: like i said my HS did not offer a class on serial killers
[3/28/18, 5:18:21 PM] Donk: see, i think that you are absolutley wrong on that
[3/28/18, 5:18:33 PM] Donk: way more people probably didnt knwot he blindside was based on a true story than zodiac
[3/28/18, 5:18:35 PM] Launchpad: also, no one knows who Michael Oher is
[3/28/18, 5:18:36 PM] Miller: and unlike the rest of you totally normal adjusted people i was not spending all my free time studying and researching serial killers
[3/28/18, 5:18:49 PM] Miller: i will fight you to the death on that
[3/28/18, 5:19:04 PM] Brian Katz: Ironman and the hulk were in that? Lol
[3/28/18, 5:19:22 PM] Donk: you think that 99% of this country are avid michael lewis fans but no one has heard of the zodiac killer, get out of here with that nonsense
[3/28/18, 5:19:36 PM] Miller: you dont need to be an avid michael lewis fan
[3/28/18, 5:19:45 PM] Launchpad: I read Flash Boys
[3/28/18, 5:19:47 PM] Miller: the entire marketing campaign for the blind side revolved around it being based on a true story
[3/28/18, 5:20:05 PM] Brian Katz: I bet you‚Äôre wrong. You‚Äôve obviously know who he was to bother to see it
[3/28/18, 5:20:19 PM] Donk: the marketing campaign didnt have to revolve around it being based ona true story because everyone knows about he zodiac killer already lol
[3/28/18, 5:20:28 PM] Miller: audience poll leaving the zodiac was overwhelmingly people annoyed b/c the ending was so open-ended
[3/28/18, 5:20:31 PM] Launchpad: BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW WHO THAT RUDY ASS MOTHERFUCKER ACTUALLY WAS UNLIKE THE ZODIAC KILLER
[3/28/18, 5:21:22 PM] Brian Katz: Should have they just ended it like, yeah we got em. It was the guy who ran the theater?
[3/28/18, 5:22:11 PM] Miller: why would you think like the 8th most famous serial killer in US history who has not been mentioned in 40 years is everyday common knowledge for a movie aimed at 18-34 year old males
[3/28/18, 5:22:37 PM] Miller: the point is people would not have been annoyed by the lack of ending if they knew it was a true story
[3/28/18, 5:23:49 PM] Launchpad: I went to a 70's themed party this weekend in which ~95% of the people in attendance were not alive for
[3/28/18, 5:24:04 PM] Brian Katz: You had to have known it was a true story. Guy was in the news for 20 years
[3/28/18, 5:25:14 PM] Launchpad: but please explain to us how your ignorance makes you not a hypocrite and that you are actually smarter than Derrius Guice
[3/28/18, 5:26:02 PM] Miller: i have no way of knowing if i am smarter than derrius guice or not, i am most likely way worse at football that much is pretty certain
[3/28/18, 5:26:13 PM] Brian Katz: Did summer of sam advertise as based on a true story?
[3/28/18, 5:26:40 PM] Launchpad: One Night in Paris was also based on a true story
[3/28/18, 5:26:41 PM] Miller: did they end that movie or na?
[3/28/18, 5:27:03 PM] Miller: if you can make a movie a good movie and it has an ending then whether i know it is based on a true story or not it doesnt matter
[3/28/18, 5:27:24 PM] Miller: using based on a true story as an excuse to make a shitty movie is a cop out
[3/28/18, 5:27:43 PM] Donk: lol
[3/28/18, 5:28:21 PM] Donk: you are ridiculous
[3/28/18, 5:28:32 PM] Miller: 20 years of hey remember the zodiac killer? yea still dont know who it was, we will check back in tomorrow when we still dont know who it is
[3/28/18, 5:28:44 PM] Brian Katz: Summer of sam blew
[3/28/18, 5:28:49 PM] Brian Katz: How many serial killers go Uncaught?
[3/28/18, 5:28:57 PM] Miller: 42%
[3/28/18, 5:29:02 PM] Justin: 7
[3/28/18, 5:29:03 PM] Miller: you all vastly overrate the culutral significance of the zodiac killer
[3/28/18, 5:29:11 PM] Brian Katz: No he kept sending in letters to the police
[3/28/18, 5:30:11 PM] Brian Katz: I think you vastly unrate it.
[3/28/18, 5:30:21 PM] Brian Katz: Under rate*
[3/28/18, 5:30:23 PM] Miller: you just going to library every day peering through old school film reels from 60s and 70s
[3/28/18, 5:30:40 PM] Miller: oh wow did you know in 1964 8 people died in a warehouse fire
[3/28/18, 5:30:47 PM] Miller: good to know in case they ever make a movie about it
[3/28/18, 5:31:07 PM] Brian Katz: You know it. They‚Äôve also had countless specials on it, books, movies.
[3/28/18, 5:31:14 PM] Launchpad: You vastly overrate your ability to negotiate your ignorance while distancing yourself from from hypocrisy & irony
[3/28/18, 5:32:07 PM] Brian Katz: I know that in the 1920‚Äôs all those women burned up in the triangle building in New York, because their boss locked the door from the outside, so the wouldn‚Äôt take any breaks.
[3/28/18, 5:32:10 PM] Miller: in addition to not having a class in HS on serial killers my cable package also did not include the Serial Killer Network so i probably missed all the specials
[3/28/18, 5:32:39 PM] Donk: thats called the ID Channel now
[3/28/18, 5:33:08 PM] Miller: ill be sure to tivo all future serial killer specials just so i can be prepared
[3/28/18, 5:33:11 PM] Brian Katz: They were on discovery, dateline, biography, etc.
[3/28/18, 5:33:40 PM] Miller: i was fucking jerking off and playing videogames i wasnt watching dateline
[3/28/18, 5:33:46 PM] Miller: (in that respect little has changed)
[3/28/18, 5:34:31 PM] Brian Katz: Serial killers are interesting to me. Idk why?
[3/28/18, 5:37:06 PM] Miller: Okay so maybe comparing yourself who has a known interest in the genre to an average person isn't the best example
[3/28/18, 5:37:07 PM] Justin: people eat this shit up
[3/28/18, 5:37:14 PM] Justin: joia listens to about 5 real crime podcasts
[3/28/18, 5:37:28 PM] Launchpad: And Guice at 11?
[3/28/18, 5:38:05 PM] Brian Katz: I think it‚Äôs a very popular subject. Enough to make multiple movies in the genre.
[3/28/18, 5:38:06 PM] Launchpad: Why would you see the movie and complain about it if the subject matter isn't interesting?
[3/28/18, 5:38:52 PM] Justin: last podcat on the left, my favorite murder, real crime podcast
[3/28/18, 5:39:02 PM] Miller: It was not billed as a fucking serial killer documentary
[3/28/18, 5:39:07 PM] Miller: Go watch the trailer
[3/28/18, 5:39:19 PM] Justin: maybe you were too young?
[3/28/18, 5:39:26 PM] Donk: we were like 20
[3/28/18, 5:39:31 PM] Justin: yeh too young
[3/28/18, 5:39:34 PM] Donk: miller should hav eknown about the zodiac killer
[3/28/18, 5:39:39 PM] Justin: i mean that movie iis targeting everyone 30+
[3/28/18, 5:39:41 PM] Donk: i think the rest of us did
[3/28/18, 5:39:48 PM] Justin: yeh but we werent target audience
[3/28/18, 5:40:00 PM] Miller: Legitimately half my theater didn't know
[3/28/18, 5:40:06 PM] Miller: People were pissed
[3/28/18, 5:40:10 PM] Justin: lol you polled the,?
[3/28/18, 5:40:11 PM] Donk: in binghamton?
[3/28/18, 5:40:14 PM] Miller: Yea
[3/28/18, 5:40:25 PM] Donk: probaboy not the best audience
[3/28/18, 5:40:36 PM] Justin: you use like a 1-5 likertscale?
[3/28/18, 5:40:37 PM] Donk: i saw farnheit 911 in upstate NY and that also didnt play well
[3/28/18, 5:40:45 PM] Fberg: I‚Äôm currently watching the Biggie/Tupac Murders Show on USA, can‚Äôt wait to see how it ends now
[3/28/18, 5:40:53 PM] Justin: lol
[3/28/18, 5:40:55 PM] Donk: uh oh
[3/28/18, 5:41:56 PM] Miller: No 3 people walked out and most I heard bitching on the way out
[3/28/18, 5:42:18 PM] Miller: How many movies have you been to where 3 people walked out? Even 1 person?
[3/28/18, 5:43:29 PM] Launchpad: I thought you said the reason the movie sucked is because it didn't have an ending. How is it possible these people left early and saw the end?
[3/28/18, 5:43:46 PM] Miller: Who said they saw the end?
[3/28/18, 5:43:51 PM] Miller: I saw the end
[3/28/18, 5:43:58 PM] Miller: Clearly if they left they didn't
[3/28/18, 5:44:04 PM] Miller: Nice try trapping me tho lol
[3/28/18, 5:47:43 PM] Miller: It's very simple if I watch making a murderer on Netflix I am fine with that not having a resolution because I understand going into it it's a documentary and based on a true story and not always a neat wrapped up ending
If you go watch that zodiac movie trailer without any preexisting knowledge of the crime and case you would think it's a normal serial killer mystery movie and would expect it to have an ending
[3/28/18, 5:49:39 PM] Miller: Remember how the preview for the movie drive made it seem like an exciting action movie and then the movie ended up being 90 percent awkward staring over synth music? It's like that
[3/28/18, 5:49:43 PM] Donk: you want us to excuse your ignorance about zodiac, but dont want to do the same for guice?
[3/28/18, 5:49:43 PM] Miller: Just set expectations appropriately
[3/28/18, 5:50:14 PM] Donk: or not ignorance, sounded harsher
[3/28/18, 5:50:15 PM] Donk: meant a gap
[3/28/18, 5:50:18 PM] Donk: like bitmoji's
[3/28/18, 5:50:23 PM] Miller: I have no issue of guice didn't know the blind side was based on a true story before he went to go see it, but afterwards and by now yes he should know that
[3/28/18, 5:50:41 PM] Miller: Kind of like how I didn't know zodiac was based on a true story and now I do
[3/28/18, 5:52:20 PM] Fberg: Generally I‚Äôm not a fan of unexplained endings. I‚Äôve invested time and need a result. See Sopranos
[3/28/18, 5:53:26 PM] Miller: It's even worse in this case, sopranos was at least an epic story with tons of characters, the type of movie zodiac was the entire point of the movie is trying to figure out who the fuck did it
[3/28/18, 5:53:59 PM] Launchpad: its fine to hate the movie just admit you're a hypocrite
[3/28/18, 5:54:47 PM] Fberg: Inception, was the whole movie a dream, just tell us
[3/28/18, 5:54:52 PM] Miller: Like if true detective season 1 ended without telling us who the killer was
[3/28/18, 5:55:18 PM] Launchpad: can you stop spoiling things please?
[3/28/18, 5:55:20 PM] Miller: Sure as soon you explain how it's hypocritical
[3/28/18, 5:55:26 PM] Miller: Which you have yet to do
[3/28/18, 5:55:27 PM] Miller: Besides just saying it
[3/28/18, 5:55:58 PM] Scott: Millenials
[3/28/18, 5:56:13 PM] Miller: If there was a serial killer today and I said wow that killing is just like that movie zodiac but real life
[3/28/18, 5:56:17 PM] Miller: That would be hypocritical
[3/28/18, 5:57:17 PM] Fberg: times expired for spoiler protection for Inception
[3/28/18, 5:58:06 PM] Launchpad: You blasted him for not knowing a movie was based on a true story then preceded to talk about how you hated a movies ending because you didn't know was based on a true story. IRONY 101
[3/28/18, 5:58:34 PM] Launchpad: hahah I meant True Detective S1
[3/28/18, 5:58:42 PM] Miller: I am getting more and more convinced you don't know the definition of irony or hypocrisy
[3/28/18, 5:58:55 PM] Miller: Clearly I do know zodiac was based on a true story
[3/28/18, 5:59:24 PM] Launchpad: now you do
[3/28/18, 5:59:32 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/28/18, 5:59:38 PM] Miller: Was that guice quote from before he saw the blind side?
[3/28/18, 5:59:43 PM] Miller: Or from now?
[3/28/18, 5:59:55 PM] Launchpad: when did he see the movie?
[3/28/18, 6:00:21 PM] Miller: Spoiler alert because it's not based on a true story they actually tell you who the killer is just like every other fucking movie or TV series in existence
[3/28/18, 6:01:09 PM] Launchpad: Maybe he saw the Blind Side when he was 18 and Michael Oher was back to being a nobody?
[3/28/18, 6:01:22 PM] Launchpad: is it possible he saw it on Netflix and didn't know it was based on a true story?
[3/28/18, 6:01:29 PM] Launchpad: cause he didn't remember the trailers when he was 11?
[3/28/18, 6:01:42 PM] Launchpad: Your logic is so Tumpian
[3/28/18, 6:02:18 PM] Miller: Lol okay guy
[3/28/18, 6:02:23 PM] Launchpad: you think your ignorance gets a free pass because you're the one whose ignorant.  Your ego is so big you think that if YOU don't know something than other people shouldn't be expected to and vice versa
[3/28/18, 6:02:31 PM] Miller: Go blow a horse
[3/28/18, 6:02:45 PM] Launchpad: wow you knew the blind side was based on a true story? Maybe everyone didn't
[3/28/18, 6:03:14 PM] Launchpad: You've now basically conceded Im right
[3/28/18, 6:03:35 PM] Miller: Is that how it works?
[3/28/18, 6:03:48 PM] Launchpad: yup
[3/28/18, 6:04:14 PM] Miller: Guy makes a stupid quote that was awkwardly phrased, I make fun of him
[3/28/18, 6:04:31 PM] Miller: If I said some stupid shit he can make fun of me, I really couldn't care less
[3/28/18, 6:04:44 PM] Miller: I'm sure my ego is bigger than a projected 1st Rd nfl rb
[3/28/18, 6:04:47 PM] Miller: You got me there
[3/28/18, 6:05:00 PM] Miller: You analyzed me to a T
[3/28/18, 6:05:06 PM] Launchpad: and you complained about the ending of a movie that you didn't know was based on a true story but everyone else did -- so we make fun of you
[3/28/18, 6:05:12 PM] Miller: Had no idea you were a psychologist
[3/28/18, 6:05:55 PM] Launchpad: Your T levels because you didn't eat brazil nuts üìâ
[3/28/18, 6:05:58 PM] Launchpad: and you are a doctor and dietician
[3/28/18, 6:06:06 PM] Launchpad: not to mention lawyer
[3/28/18, 6:07:08 PM] Miller: And you've done nothing to prove that people outside this 5 person sample size knew one movie was based on a true story vs the other
[3/28/18, 6:07:17 PM] Miller: But you just keep saying it which makes you right
[3/28/18, 6:07:21 PM] Miller: You're just like trump
[3/28/18, 6:08:09 PM] Launchpad: and you took a poll before throwing Guice under the bus?
[3/28/18, 6:08:31 PM] Miller: You also have a complete inability to understand the difference not knowing a movie was based on a true story before and after seeing it
[3/28/18, 6:09:45 PM] Miller: You know how at the end of invincible they show you the real Vince papal, now if you went into the movie not knowing it was based on a true story okay fine, if you left the movie still not knowing that, that is pretty dumb
[3/28/18, 6:10:41 PM] Miller: I did actually, I polled the audience after zodiac and the blindside, nobody walked out of the blindside
[3/28/18, 6:11:07 PM] Launchpad: Do they say that the Blind Side is a true story inside the movie itself? Or just the trailers?
[3/28/18, 6:11:07 PM] Launchpad: I've never heard of Vince Papale & I never saw Invincible
[3/28/18, 6:11:13 PM] Launchpad: did you ask the people who walked out if they knew the movie was based on a true story?
[3/28/18, 6:11:48 PM] Miller: They tell you about the real Michael Oher at the end of the movie and show him
[3/28/18, 6:12:06 PM] Miller: Like they do almost every movie based on a true story
[3/28/18, 6:12:56 PM] Launchpad: Maybe he never actually saw the movie?
[3/28/18, 6:13:13 PM] Launchpad: Maybe he knew of the plot and how it parallels his own life
[3/28/18, 6:13:27 PM] Launchpad: Maybe hes going to travel back in time to watch it as an 11 year old
[3/28/18, 6:13:33 PM] Miller: Why don't you ask him
[3/28/18, 6:13:37 PM] Miller: Go to the draft
[3/28/18, 6:19:56 PM] Miller: Double up if you see golic at the draft ask him if he meant to ask about time travel
[3/28/18, 6:25:34 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/28/18, 6:26:32 PM] Miller: You decide to try to start dating chicks 10 years younger than you for a change?
[3/28/18, 6:28:56 PM] Launchpad: So what if Guice meant to say "It was the Blind Side come true [for me]" and the implication was lost in the translation
[3/28/18, 6:29:23 PM] Launchpad: nah shes my coworker I can ask the 26 year old girl Im banging if you'd like
[3/28/18, 6:30:14 PM] Miller: Much like Mike golic if people phrased things properly then there would be no humor in it
[3/28/18, 6:39:34 PM] Scott: https://www.facebook.com/LADbible/videos/4581230658590755/
[3/28/18, 6:39:39 PM] Scott: Hilarious
[3/28/18, 7:08:20 PM] Justin: lol, i finally got to be the puppet master
[3/28/18, 7:42:40 PM] Justin: https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/amazon-getting-whacked-following-report-134800385.html
[3/28/18, 7:42:53 PM] Justin: lets go Trumpppppp
[3/28/18, 7:43:30 PM] Dan Watts: Finally admitting this guy is your boy
[3/28/18, 7:44:02 PM] Justin: was waiting for him to come around
[3/28/18, 7:44:15 PM] Justin: alwayys knew he told it like it is
[3/28/18, 7:44:22 PM] Launchpad: lolol
[3/28/18, 7:44:33 PM] Launchpad: Jill Stein vote makes so much sense
[3/28/18, 7:44:45 PM] Justin: i mean if i could have had Putin
[3/28/18, 7:44:51 PM] Launchpad: gotta keep up appearances in the Herman household
[3/28/18, 7:44:53 PM] Justin: next nest thing jill stein or trump
[3/28/18, 7:46:06 PM] Justin: gonna be funny if by 2020 hes tanked the market and is my hero
[3/28/18, 7:46:28 PM] Launchpad: lol
[3/28/18, 7:46:38 PM] Launchpad: what does tanking the market do for you?
[3/28/18, 7:46:50 PM] Launchpad: It was great for the entire world and employment when it happened in 2007
[3/28/18, 7:47:58 PM] Dan Watts: Bc the worker will win
[3/28/18, 7:48:05 PM] Dan Watts: He won't have a job
[3/28/18, 7:48:16 PM] Dan Watts: But hey better than those rich fucks making $
[3/28/18, 7:48:39 PM] Justin: i fundamentally disagree with whats good for the market is good for america
[3/28/18, 7:49:09 PM] Justin: whats good for the market is ...wait for it....... good for the market
[3/28/18, 7:49:38 PM] Miller: So what's bad for the market is good for America
[3/28/18, 7:49:44 PM] Launchpad: on that I would agree....however....whats bad for the market is also bad for everyone else
[3/28/18, 7:49:49 PM] Justin: didnt say that
[3/28/18, 7:49:59 PM] Justin: its not inherently bad for america though
[3/28/18, 7:50:00 PM] Miller: I hope amazon bans you
[3/28/18, 7:50:03 PM] Justin: lol
[3/28/18, 7:50:04 PM] Launchpad: lol
[3/28/18, 7:50:08 PM] Justin: already abnning myself
[3/28/18, 7:50:13 PM] Miller: Put your money where your mouth is don't shop there
[3/28/18, 7:50:14 PM] Justin: cant do it anymore, fuck that guy
[3/28/18, 7:50:17 PM] Justin: i dont
[3/28/18, 7:50:31 PM] Miller: Good go buy everything from small locally owned businesses
[3/28/18, 7:50:59 PM] Justin: not getting the insult here
[3/28/18, 7:51:02 PM] Miller: Please don't buy anything made in China
[3/28/18, 7:51:12 PM] Justin: lol
[3/28/18, 7:51:20 PM] Justin: you know where i want to go with all this
[3/28/18, 7:51:25 PM] Miller: Because I'm sure tons of shit you buy is Chinese crap from target
[3/28/18, 7:51:28 PM] Miller: But that's okay
[3/28/18, 7:51:42 PM] Justin: theres a level of choice which has been taken away
[3/28/18, 7:51:51 PM] Miller: No there isn't
[3/28/18, 7:51:54 PM] Miller: Grow all your own food
[3/28/18, 7:51:58 PM] Justin: lol
[3/28/18, 7:51:58 PM] Miller: Make your own clothes
[3/28/18, 7:52:08 PM] Justin: you realize how insane your analogy here is
[3/28/18, 7:52:15 PM] Miller: Instead you just pick and choose what level of consumerism bullshit is okay
[3/28/18, 7:52:21 PM] Miller: Walmart bad target good
[3/28/18, 7:52:30 PM] Miller: Amazon bad Newegg good
[3/28/18, 7:52:34 PM] Justin: globalization has undercut all kidns of industries thus forcing us to rely on foreign products, but somehow therefore it smy fault i cant grow my own goods
[3/28/18, 7:52:51 PM] Justin: nah amazon is relaly fucken bad
[3/28/18, 7:53:20 PM] Justin: he has contracts iwth the nsa, he doesnt pay any taxes, he has nearly 10% workforce working on food stamps, he udnercut everyone by not ahving to pay taxes
[3/28/18, 7:53:32 PM] Justin: control 60% of ecommerce i believe?
[3/28/18, 7:53:40 PM] Miller: Bernie sanders doesn't pay taxes either
[3/28/18, 7:53:44 PM] Miller: What's your point
[3/28/18, 7:54:05 PM] Miller: Nobody with an ounce of intelligence pays a dollar more than they have to in taxes
[3/28/18, 7:54:06 PM] Launchpad: Amazon has saved me a ridiculous amount of money
[3/28/18, 7:54:32 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[3/28/18, 7:54:56 PM] Justin: althought the eas eof access has perhaps cost you more as well?
[3/28/18, 7:55:04 PM] Launchpad: not at all
[3/28/18, 7:55:11 PM] Justin: i mean thats pretty superfluous poitn either way
[3/28/18, 7:55:15 PM] Launchpad: not only has it saved me a shit load of money, also a shit load of time
[3/28/18, 7:55:41 PM] Launchpad: Need cat food? Good now I don't have to drive 10 min each way to petco
[3/28/18, 7:55:41 PM] Launchpad: every month
[3/28/18, 7:56:00 PM] Justin: thats funny because amazon is now opening chain sotres
[3/28/18, 7:56:11 PM] Justin: so apprently his brilliance disagrees with that
[3/28/18, 7:56:25 PM] Miller: Yea pretty sure they're going all brick and mortar
[3/28/18, 7:56:30 PM] Miller: Even gonna shut down the website
[3/28/18, 7:57:03 PM] Justin: one day you will be able to argue with nuance
[3/28/18, 7:57:16 PM] Miller: That's the same thing as opening like a store, clearly opening a store cancels out the entire principle which the company was built on
[3/28/18, 7:57:17 PM] Launchpad: featuring no humans
[3/28/18, 7:57:37 PM] Justin: so amazon gonna drone that shit over to you so you dont have to drive 10 mins
[3/28/18, 7:58:03 PM] Launchpad: Minds that Herman has changed: 0‚É£
[3/28/18, 7:58:56 PM] Justin: not exactly the end goal, i still dont need to resort to hyperbole and random 9 degrees of seperation arguments to make a point
[3/28/18, 7:59:04 PM] Justin: id rather be in my shoes
[3/28/18, 7:59:32 PM] Miller: Better not be ordering from 6pm if you need new ones
[3/28/18, 7:59:33 PM] Justin: me-trump good job on not actually doing anything on amazon
[3/28/18, 7:59:39 PM] Miller: Sorry zappos
[3/28/18, 7:59:42 PM] Justin: miller put your  oney where your mouth is stop sharing there
[3/28/18, 7:59:44 PM] Justin: me i did
[3/28/18, 7:59:46 PM] Miller: Got my shoe companies mixed up
[3/28/18, 7:59:52 PM] Justin: miller oh so what about china and target
[3/28/18, 8:00:13 PM] Justin: me globalization ahs made it impossible for me to get goods made locallay
[3/28/18, 8:00:16 PM] Justin: miller grow it on your own
[3/28/18, 8:00:25 PM] Justin: me - clearly not feasiable solution
[3/28/18, 8:00:34 PM] Miller: Yea i was there for this
[3/28/18, 8:00:38 PM] Miller: It was 5 seconds ago
[3/28/18, 8:01:21 PM] Justin: notice from starting point to finish where we end up.....      dont ship there-ok i dont
[3/28/18, 8:01:36 PM] Justin: now i dont know if ill ever have to steal some shitty tv series they produce
[3/28/18, 8:01:41 PM] Justin: so far so good i think
[3/28/18, 8:01:37 PM] Launchpad: Despite popular belief, companies no longer 'outsource' production to China because it's cheaper...

As Tim Cook, CEO of iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) explained in an interview with Fortune magazine last December...

    There's a confusion about China... the popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I'm not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is, China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view...

    The reason is because of the skill, and the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is.

    The products we [make] require really advanced tooling. And the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state-of-the-art. And the tooling skill is very deep here... In the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.

In other words, many U.S. companies now outsource production to China because no one else ‚Äì including the U.S. ‚Äì has enough of the expertise they require. They have no other choice.
[3/28/18, 8:01:55 PM] Dan Watts: Pretty sure Joia has dragged you to multiple farm to table
Restaurants
[3/28/18, 8:02:13 PM] Justin: .......
[3/28/18, 8:02:18 PM] Launchpad: lol
[3/28/18, 8:02:38 PM] Justin: ceo says we cant hire america becuase america suxks and isnt talented
[3/28/18, 8:02:42 PM] Justin: if i say that im a communist
[3/28/18, 8:02:50 PM] Justin: no double standard
[3/28/18, 8:03:11 PM] Miller: Can't hire America?
[3/28/18, 8:03:19 PM] Miller: They employ like 9 billion Americans
[3/28/18, 8:03:38 PM] Launchpad: no the point is that China is no longer the place to make cheap goods -- thats Vietnam, Cambodia, Loas
[3/28/18, 8:03:46 PM] Launchpad: China is skilled labor / tech
[3/28/18, 8:03:51 PM] Justin: Tim cook is literally making the argument for protetionism there
[3/28/18, 8:04:13 PM] Miller: All I'm saying is what's the point in singling out amazon
[3/28/18, 8:04:19 PM] Miller: All these companies are the same
[3/28/18, 8:04:48 PM] Miller: Unless you're going to live on a farm in Amish country you don't really have a choice
[3/28/18, 8:04:54 PM] Justin: amazon is a behemoth and i dot like there connections with deep state
[3/28/18, 8:05:19 PM] Miller: Was the computer or phone you're typing on made by Apple in a sweat shop? Probably
[3/28/18, 8:05:24 PM] Miller: Is that okay though?
[3/28/18, 8:05:44 PM] Launchpad: However, Steve also agrees that these tariffs are unlikely to help American companies...

As he explained, while they aren't a threat to Chinese stocks, they could hurt everyday American consumers. He shared a portion of an interview he conducted with Asia investment expert Peter Churchouse nearly one year ago to explain why...

    Peter: Most people around the world recognize that China is dumping steel into the world markets at what you might call unfair prices. So [tariffs on] steel is one thing that I think will get support from a lot of people around the world. But the rest of it? No.

    The fact of the matter is, you are buying your TVs and your computers and your mobile phones and everything a heck of a lot cheaper today then you were 10 or 15 years ago. And why is that? It's because they have come from China and other parts of Asia where the manufacturing costs are that much lower.

    If you start slapping 35% taxes and tariffs on all this stuff, it means you are raising the price on the American consumer. So in a way, that is hurting the people who voted for Trump. It is not really helping businesses...

Peter also confirmed what we heard from Cook earlier: The idea that China is flooding the U.S. with cheap U.S. goods is simply no longer the case...

    Steve: I wonder if Trump just hasn't been to China in a while... Because when you took me around China a couple years ago and we visited companies making shirts, what did they tell us?

    Peter: They told us basically they had moved into Vietnam and Bangladesh where the wages and salaries of workers are a third or a quarter of what they are in China. So in a way, the story about China producing all these cheap low-end goods like shoes and t-shirts and jackets and so on... that story is already gone.

    It has gone somewhere else. It has gone to Vietnam, Bangladesh, India... And it will be hitting into Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. So that story has disappeared. They are barking up the wrong tree if that is what they are thinking.
[3/28/18, 8:05:47 PM] Justin: i mean you gotta draw the line somehwere i suppose
[3/28/18, 8:06:25 PM] Justin: tim cook is full of shit
[3/28/18, 8:06:34 PM] Miller: That's a hate crime
[3/28/18, 8:06:48 PM] Justin: we have  gluttony of masters nad phd students without jobs in america
[3/28/18, 8:06:55 PM] Miller: Calling Tim Cook a fudge packer? You've crossed a line
[3/28/18, 8:07:01 PM] Justin: the reason china has brighter and better minds, is becuase china is cheaper
[3/28/18, 8:07:03 PM] Launchpad: got em üòÇ
[3/28/18, 8:07:21 PM] Launchpad: phds are highly specialized
[3/28/18, 8:07:43 PM] Launchpad: meaning there needs to be a market need to justify the higher salary
[3/28/18, 8:07:54 PM] Launchpad: sure Phds could get the same jobs as their BS counterparts
[3/28/18, 8:08:03 PM] Justin: The products we [make] require really advanced tooling. And the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state-of-the-art. And the tooling skill is very deep here... In the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.
[3/28/18, 8:09:09 PM] Justin: whatever as pointe dout Ive won over zero minds, so how about you shut the fuck up and stop attacking my stance then?
[3/28/18, 8:09:34 PM] Launchpad: boredom
[3/28/18, 8:09:44 PM] Justin: fair

[3/28/18, 11:33:20 PM] Launchpad: "Walmart will continue to offer Cosmopolitan to customers that wish to purchase the magazine, but it will no longer be located in the checkout aisles."  aka "who gives a shit"
[3/29/18, 12:27:04 AM] Justin: i stated my point?

[3/29/18, 8:02:54 AM] Miller: @realDonaldTrump
I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!
[3/29/18, 8:02:59 AM] Miller: now that is hypocrisy
[3/29/18, 8:03:22 AM] Miller: (and also that is kind of the job of the postal system, to deliver things, they get paid for it)
[3/29/18, 8:07:14 AM] Fberg: Can‚Äôt wait for all the right wing, keep govt regulation out of private sector, nut jobs come out in support of Amazon
[3/29/18, 8:07:42 AM] Miller: amazon should just choose not to release their tax returns
[3/29/18, 8:09:30 AM] Fberg: I like it. It‚Äôs not like DJT is any kind of hypocrite
[3/29/18, 8:10:52 AM] Miller: 1st the tariffs, now this, by 2020 herman is gonna be campaigning for the trump re-election campaign
[3/29/18, 8:12:34 AM] Fberg: Forget trump in 2020, I‚Äôm voting for the Sanders/Herman ticket
[3/29/18, 8:14:39 AM] Fberg: Doesn‚Äôt this fight against amazon seem to help his buddies from the Walton family
[3/29/18, 8:21:54 AM] Dan Watts: Go mets?
[3/29/18, 8:22:11 AM] Miller: nats game postponed, this is their one chance to be in 1st in the division
[3/29/18, 8:22:37 AM] Miller: pretty sweet day of work here, mets game 1pm, bringing in chick-fil-a for lunch and synthetic friday so im outta here @ 4

[3/29/18, 10:08:31 AM] Launchpad: is that what we are supposed to see? the pictures?
[3/29/18, 10:08:53 AM] Miller: no
[3/29/18, 10:08:56 AM] Launchpad: I dont see it üôà

[3/29/18, 11:52:09 AM] Justin: Everything he said is right
[3/29/18, 11:52:22 AM] Justin: Also some to most is valid  for many companies
[3/29/18, 11:52:30 AM] Miller: its true, i also use the postal service as my delivery boy
[3/29/18, 11:52:31 AM] Justin: And trump cleary doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about any of it
[3/29/18, 11:53:07 AM] Miller: lets go herman put your money where your mouth is, no more mail
[3/29/18, 11:53:13 AM] Justin: You pay for stamps dumb dum.
[3/29/18, 11:53:40 AM] Miller: amazon figured out a loophole to ship things w/o paying?
[3/29/18, 11:53:46 AM] Justin: You are also a citizen paying taxes
[3/29/18, 11:54:10 AM] Justin: You pay for the roads. Amazon doesn‚Äôt
[3/29/18, 11:54:26 AM] Justin: Oh pay for postal service and police. Amazon doesn‚Äôt
[3/29/18, 11:55:19 AM] Miller: wesley snipes doesnt pay taxes, he gets sent to jail
[3/29/18, 11:55:29 AM] Miller: everyone in the world knows amazon doesnt pay taxes and ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[3/29/18, 11:56:23 AM] Justin: I can‚Äôt find the evidence on costs to usps I have heard it before. Could be hearsay
[3/29/18, 11:56:35 AM] Miller: hope bernie sanders doesnt ever use the police
[3/29/18, 11:56:36 AM] Justin: Yeh I‚Äôm not justifying trump
[3/29/18, 11:56:37 AM] Miller: he doesnt pay taxes
[3/29/18, 11:56:42 AM] Justin: Trump doesn‚Äôt believe anything he says
[3/29/18, 11:56:49 AM] Justin: Doesn‚Äôt make some things he says wrong
[3/29/18, 11:57:10 AM] Miller: hes not wrong, amazon does use the postal service as their delivery boy
[3/29/18, 11:57:17 AM] Miller: which is in fact their intended function
[3/29/18, 11:57:50 AM] Justin: Yeh. Idk I have to see what people mean when they say unfairly abuses.
[3/29/18, 11:58:24 AM] Justin: Obviously not paying taxes pretty shitty and enough of a reason, but plenty of companies don‚Äôt pay taxes
[3/29/18, 11:58:39 AM] Miller: and when amazon creates their own delivery system and the USPS goes out of business b/c they are outdated and unprofitable im sure everyone is gonna be crying about amazon putting the USPS out of business
[3/29/18, 11:58:45 AM] Justin: Maybe it has to do with Sunday delivery?
[3/29/18, 11:59:08 AM] Justin: But that might be dea with fed ex not amazon can‚Äôt remember
[3/29/18, 11:59:31 AM] Miller: is amazon blackmailing all these companies into shipping things for them for free? like come on
[3/29/18, 12:00:02 PM] Justin: Well it‚Äôs government run operation and bezos gets government to do whatever he wants. So there‚Äôs that.
[3/29/18, 12:00:36 PM] Launchpad: maybe govt run operations just aren't as efficient and competitive?
[3/29/18, 12:00:54 PM] Justin: How we shift this to postal service?
[3/29/18, 12:01:13 PM] Miller: except to stop tweeting about him apparently
[3/29/18, 12:01:13 PM] Justin: You think bezos wants to open a delivery service not involving drones?
[3/29/18, 12:01:28 PM] Justin: Why would he take on those costs.  Specifically when there are already 2
[3/29/18, 12:02:33 PM] Miller: https://nypost.com/2018/02/09/amazon-planning-delivery-service-to-rival-fedex-and-ups/

[3/29/18, 12:02:57 PM] Justin: This is what I cared about
[3/29/18, 12:04:15 PM] Justin: Fair enough. I‚Äôm sure that company won‚Äôt pay any taxes and  will pay there workers shit as well.
[3/29/18, 12:04:32 PM] Justin: At least the drivers will have cool bracelets that shock them when they make the wrong turns
[3/29/18, 12:05:23 PM] Miller: you should be paying 100% of your income in taxes to help make up for these shortfalls
[3/29/18, 12:05:25 PM] Justin: Like the second scene in ghostbusters except bill Murray is some billion dollar douchebag
[3/29/18, 12:05:28 PM] Miller: its the least you can do
[3/29/18, 12:05:47 PM] Miller: maybe open up an accounting practice for poeple with morals - we promise to get you the lowest refund possible
[3/29/18, 12:06:02 PM] Justin: Does amazons stock price effect its ability to deliver your package?
[3/29/18, 12:06:19 PM] Justin: If it paid taxes would the service not exist?
[3/29/18, 12:06:38 PM] Justin: Just curious my hyperbole
[3/29/18, 12:06:41 PM] Justin: Mr*
[3/29/18, 12:06:44 PM] Miller: does the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES tweeting about a private company with baseless nonsense allegations b/c he has an issue with the CEO b/c he doesnt like him set a good precedent?
[3/29/18, 12:06:54 PM] Justin: He‚Äôs a dick
[3/29/18, 12:07:02 PM] Justin: Also an idiot.
[3/29/18, 12:07:07 PM] Justin: Nothing he says has any merit
[3/29/18, 12:07:11 PM] Miller: and yet
[3/29/18, 12:07:20 PM] Justin: Doesn‚Äôt mean that he cant say something correct
[3/29/18, 12:07:24 PM] Miller: he wiped out a good chunk of AMZN mkt cap in a few days
[3/29/18, 12:07:37 PM] Justin: Ok. You still getting your packages?
[3/29/18, 12:07:55 PM] Justin: So why the fuck do you care?
[3/29/18, 12:08:05 PM] Miller: b/c of what i just said?
[3/29/18, 12:08:09 PM] Justin: Rewind
[3/29/18, 12:08:12 PM] Miller: i think it sets an insane and dangerous precedent
[3/29/18, 12:08:17 PM] Justin: Are you still getting your packages?
[3/29/18, 12:08:26 PM] Justin: Notice. The world didn‚Äôt end
[3/29/18, 12:08:30 PM] Justin: The service didn‚Äôt change
[3/29/18, 12:08:38 PM] Justin: I wonder why that is
[3/29/18, 12:09:16 PM] Miller: so as long as amazon service exists i am not allowed to complain about the insanity of this? okay
[3/29/18, 12:09:24 PM] Justin: Did amazon layoff workers after that drop?
[3/29/18, 12:09:31 PM] Justin: Cut wages?
[3/29/18, 12:09:39 PM] Miller: im sure if they did you would be then first to complain
[3/29/18, 12:09:40 PM] Launchpad: Do you pay any taxes?
[3/29/18, 12:09:55 PM] Justin: No I‚Äôm challenging how you go on and on about the service amazon
[3/29/18, 12:10:11 PM] Justin: Connect that to the stock price
[3/29/18, 12:10:17 PM] Justin: Yet there is no actual connection
[3/29/18, 12:10:29 PM] Justin: Hence if they paid taxes. The same service would exists
[3/29/18, 12:10:40 PM] Justin: If they paid workers more. The same service would exist
[3/29/18, 12:10:47 PM] Justin: But there stock price would be lower.
[3/29/18, 12:10:59 PM] Justin: As it is after an idiot president goes on a rant against them.
[3/29/18, 12:11:34 PM] Miller: i know you live in this fairy tale world where people should pay people more just b/c they can but that does not exist
[3/29/18, 12:11:37 PM] Miller: not for amazon not for anyone
[3/29/18, 12:11:44 PM] Justin: Ok and taxes
[3/29/18, 12:11:49 PM] Miller: could wells fargo afford to pay all their tellers 250k/yr? sure
[3/29/18, 12:11:50 PM] Justin: Is that fairy tale world?
[3/29/18, 12:11:53 PM] Miller: should they?
[3/29/18, 12:11:59 PM] Justin: I‚Äôm not asking should
[3/29/18, 12:12:10 PM] Miller: you think every company should have a 0% margin
[3/29/18, 12:12:15 PM] Miller: and reinvest 100% of profits into employees
[3/29/18, 12:12:25 PM] Justin: Where did I say that ?
[3/29/18, 12:12:52 PM] Justin: I m sure if we look st I come inequality productivity and where profits are invested we will see some trends over decades
[3/29/18, 12:12:53 PM] Miller: so bezos should create amazon and run it as a public service to the country
[3/29/18, 12:12:57 PM] Launchpad: Start your own business, pay all your employees 'fair' wages, pay your 'fair' share of taxes, problem solved
[3/29/18, 12:13:24 PM] Justin: My indignation belongs more at the politicians.
[3/29/18, 12:13:29 PM] Miller: is he paying his workers an unfair wage? much like USPS and fed ex and amazon is he also blackmailing them into working for him?
[3/29/18, 12:13:32 PM] Justin: You yell at me when I put it there as well
[3/29/18, 12:13:48 PM] Justin: So idk what you want from home here.
[3/29/18, 12:14:04 PM] Justin: Me*
[3/29/18, 12:14:06 PM] Miller: like do you have some bombshell report that said amazon was actually paying their employees in monopoloy money?
[3/29/18, 12:14:24 PM] Justin: No I only know 10% workforce lives in poverty
[3/29/18, 12:14:39 PM] Justin: Which kinda fucked up for biggest corporation in world
[3/29/18, 12:14:41 PM] Miller: maybe dont work there then?
[3/29/18, 12:14:46 PM] Launchpad: Amazon software engineers are some of the best paid in the industry
[3/29/18, 12:14:51 PM] Justin: That is in fact the point
[3/29/18, 12:15:04 PM] Justin: If people continue to choose to work there what does that say about their choices?
[3/29/18, 12:15:14 PM] Miller: the idea of paying people above-market-wages just "because you can" is unrealistic
[3/29/18, 12:15:16 PM] Justin: Not as in the ones they make but as in what is actually available
[3/29/18, 12:15:30 PM] Justin: Minimum wage solves that
[3/29/18, 12:15:39 PM] Justin: I agree with you
[3/29/18, 12:15:44 PM] Justin: It‚Äôs all on the government
[3/29/18, 12:16:00 PM] Miller: i know you hate capitalism but these companies goal is to drive profits and returns, they are not there to be moral beacons, they are not charities
[3/29/18, 12:16:20 PM] Justin: But I don‚Äôt like bezos working with nsc, I don‚Äôt like the idea that for someone with that much wealth he doesn‚Äôt pay above market.
[3/29/18, 12:16:35 PM] Justin: Does he have to. Fuck no
[3/29/18, 12:16:47 PM] Launchpad: Amazon pays those who contribute the most value to their company very well. Warehouse workers are easily replaceable
[3/29/18, 12:16:49 PM] Justin: I also don‚Äôt have to shop there.
[3/29/18, 12:16:59 PM] Miller: i hear bezos doesnt even tip 20%
[3/29/18, 12:17:11 PM] Miller: like his personal life or amount of wealth is totally irrelevant in any of this
[3/29/18, 12:17:37 PM] Justin: Is it?  I mean his wealth is based on his stock price. Which is based on suppression of costs
[3/29/18, 12:17:50 PM] Justin: So is wealth is directly correlated with workers wages
[3/29/18, 12:18:09 PM] Justin: And it really wouldn‚Äôt cost him all that much
[3/29/18, 12:18:12 PM] Miller: theres a number of issues there
[3/29/18, 12:18:25 PM] Justin: Maybe he drives up the market price for labor
[3/29/18, 12:18:30 PM] Miller: 1. amazon is a public company, he has a fidicuary responsibility to shareholders, bezos and otherwise
[3/29/18, 12:18:36 PM] Justin: Bullshit
[3/29/18, 12:18:40 PM] Justin: Made up thing
[3/29/18, 12:18:43 PM] Miller: lol
[3/29/18, 12:18:55 PM] Launchpad: asking again...
[3/29/18, 12:18:56 PM] Justin: I‚Äôll send you the hbr article documenting that origin
[3/29/18, 12:19:17 PM] Justin: That‚Äôs a belief system not an actual legal responsibility
[3/29/18, 12:19:04 PM] Miller: 2. the idea of someone paying more than their fair share b/c they can is literally socialism
[3/29/18, 12:19:12 PM] Miller: its just wealth re-distribution
[3/29/18, 12:19:17 PM] Miller: but its okay when its a billionare
[3/29/18, 12:19:18 PM] Miller: b/c fuck him
[3/29/18, 12:19:23 PM] Miller: he can afford it
[3/29/18, 12:19:58 PM] Justin: Let‚Äôs say I said no. Please proceed
[3/29/18, 12:20:08 PM] Miller: if a public company is not acting int he best interest of shareholders guess what happens?
[3/29/18, 12:20:10 PM] Justin: After that pretend I said yes. Give me that argument.
[3/29/18, 12:20:11 PM] Miller: mgmt gets replaced
[3/29/18, 12:20:36 PM] Justin: That‚Äôs fair. That‚Äôs the culture that the idea created.
[3/29/18, 12:20:54 PM] Launchpad: you are a hypocrite
[3/29/18, 12:21:03 PM] Justin: Ok and if I said yes ?
[3/29/18, 12:21:22 PM] Launchpad: dont know
[3/29/18, 12:21:23 PM] Justin: There is a reason I Ignored your dumb question
[3/29/18, 12:21:29 PM] Miller: are there issues with the tax laws amazon exploits?  probably
are there issues with min wage and other laws in this country amazon exploits? also probably
[3/29/18, 12:21:39 PM] Justin: Ok then we agree
[3/29/18, 12:21:45 PM] Miller: but blaming mcdonalds for not paying their employees $15/hr instead of the govt for setting the min wage is completely ass backwards
[3/29/18, 12:21:47 PM] Launchpad: but the idea that you don't pay any taxes and yet your on everyone elses cases about being taxes and being fair is bullshit
[3/29/18, 12:21:58 PM] Justin: Agree with that
[3/29/18, 12:22:19 PM] Justin: When have I asked anyone in this thread to pay higher income tax?
[3/29/18, 12:22:32 PM] Justin: In fact I said Miller should vote for trump multiple times
[3/29/18, 12:22:42 PM] Miller: that backfired
[3/29/18, 12:22:44 PM] Justin: But please continue to make irrelevant points
[3/29/18, 12:22:47 PM] Miller: even though i didnt vote for him
[3/29/18, 12:22:50 PM] Miller: still fucked me on taxes
[3/29/18, 12:22:54 PM] Miller: the one thing, the one thing i had hope for
[3/29/18, 12:22:58 PM] Justin: Lol
[3/29/18, 12:23:16 PM] Miller: keep laughing im gonna start charging a cover fee in westhampton
[3/29/18, 12:23:21 PM] Justin: Haha
[3/29/18, 12:23:27 PM] Launchpad: lol
[3/29/18, 12:23:28 PM] Justin: Now I‚Äôm dying laughing
[3/29/18, 12:26:24 PM] Justin: How it gonna end up after all said and done?
[3/29/18, 12:26:47 PM] Miller: hows what gonna end up
[3/29/18, 12:27:05 PM] Justin: Pre trump post trump tax pct
[3/29/18, 12:27:25 PM] Miller: i dont know actually, tough to tell b/c i pre-paid some property taxes last yr
[3/29/18, 12:27:41 PM] Miller: so will need a couple of yrs to shake out probably
[3/29/18, 12:28:13 PM] Miller: but if i have 35-40k in property taxes i can no longer deduct that is going to hurt, def not gonna be offset by the minimal reduction in the rates
[3/29/18, 12:57:56 PM] Justin: so in summary of argument, trump is an idiot, amazon and others pay no taxes(shocking), principle agent theory is not an actual legal construct(but that doesn't matter because it is the norm), the government sucks and should be the ones incentivizing corpations towards long term investment(or not?), I am done with amazon as a personal decision(I'm stupid), I also pay no taxes(Jersey city freeloader), and trump didn't give miller a tax break(gotta get into that .1%)
[3/29/18, 1:00:54 PM] Miller: not about being in the .1% its about not being in NY or CA, .1% people in NY also are paying higher taxes
[3/29/18, 1:01:09 PM] Miller: also you should stop using the postal service as your delivery boy
[3/29/18, 1:02:08 PM] Justin: never get mail here im good
[3/29/18, 1:02:49 PM] Justin: also economic recovery zone
[3/29/18, 1:02:52 PM] Justin: 3% slaes tax
[3/29/18, 1:02:54 PM] Justin: whats up
[3/29/18, 1:03:10 PM] Miller: you should pay 10
[3/29/18, 1:03:28 PM] Miller: dont make trump start tweeting about how you dont pay sales tax
[3/29/18, 1:03:56 PM] Miller: i assume you also make sure to adjust your taxes to pay for anything you buy online that does not get charged sales tax right?
[3/29/18, 1:06:06 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/29/18, 1:06:21 PM] Justin: loll i did have one of these
[3/29/18, 1:06:41 PM] Miller: the timing is ironic bc steve didnt hear the convo
[3/29/18, 1:06:47 PM] Miller: but the more i find out about these the dumber they are
[3/29/18, 1:07:09 PM] Kiyoon: Ok that's pretty bad

[3/29/18, 1:07:29 PM] Miller: looks like a generic white guy
[3/29/18, 1:27:33 PM] Fberg: I‚Äôm taking Corporate Law Herm, the agency relationship between directors/officers of a corporation and the shareholders is a true legal concept under corporate law, developed from the mode of agency Law
[3/29/18, 1:28:51 PM] Fberg: Obviously things get murky when the largest shareholder is one person who also controls the Board of Directors
[3/29/18, 1:29:44 PM] Fberg: I don‚Äôt understand your position that directors/officers don‚Äôt owe fiduciary duty to the shareholders. That is black letter Law
[3/29/18, 1:38:15 PM] Justin: The link that fiduciary duty is maziming profit isn‚Äôt a legal concept.
[3/29/18, 1:39:01 PM] Justin: What is ‚Äúmaximizing profit‚Äù.

[3/29/18, 1:52:26 PM] Brian Katz: Your head does look like a testicle
[3/29/18, 3:17:22 PM] Fberg: General baseball question: does the manager have to go to the mound to take a pitcher out?
[3/29/18, 3:17:46 PM] Justin: think ive seen coach do it before
[3/29/18, 3:17:48 PM] Miller: i dont think so, just customary
[3/29/18, 3:18:22 PM] Fberg: So now that there‚Äôs a limit for mound visits, can a team change pitchers without using a mound visit?
[3/29/18, 3:18:51 PM] Miller: unclear
[3/29/18, 3:19:01 PM] Miller: i think the limit on mound visits applies to non-pitching change visits
[3/29/18, 3:19:50 PM] Fberg: Ok. That would make sense. Curious to see how teams will use the limited mound visits.
[3/29/18, 3:20:32 PM] Scott: Pitching coach does alot
[3/29/18, 3:20:49 PM] Miller: thats just not true
[3/29/18, 3:21:17 PM] Scott: Yankees pitching coach would do it occasionally

[3/29/18, 5:08:08 PM] Miller: Do better
[3/29/18, 5:08:56 PM] Brian Katz: Syndergaard‚Äôs box score doesn‚Äôt make sense. How did he manage to let up 4 runs k 10 and have a whip of 1?
[3/29/18, 5:08:57 PM] Donk: im still annoyed that sterling doesnt do the arrested dev My Name is Judge for aaron judge homers

[3/31/18, 11:12:23 PM] Dan Watts: I haven't seen a team shoot like that all tourney
[3/31/18, 11:12:31 PM] Scott: I have been saying this all year
[3/31/18, 11:12:41 PM] Scott: I have never seen a team shoot like this since their 2016 team
[3/31/18, 11:12:48 PM] Scott: And no other team before that. Its unreal
[3/31/18, 11:13:01 PM] Scott: Their 4 and 5 shoot as well as their 1-3
[3/31/18, 11:13:02 PM] Dan Watts: They set a record for # of 3s in a season
[3/31/18, 11:13:24 PM] Scott: They set a record for number of 3s in a tourney game with 19 mins left in 2nd hald
[3/31/18, 11:13:38 PM] Scott: This is the best nova I have seen because of the fact they have great big men
[3/31/18, 11:14:48 PM] Miller: Are they gonna beat Michigan?

[4/2/18, 1:32:16 PM] Dan Watts: Autopilot system accidents
[4/2/18, 1:32:25 PM] Dan Watts: They owe a ton of money
[4/2/18, 1:32:34 PM] Miller: also massive tech selloff
[4/2/18, 1:32:37 PM] Miller: bad timing
[4/2/18, 1:33:01 PM] Miller: the autopilot thing is so dumb, idk if anyone else watched the video
[4/2/18, 1:33:10 PM] Miller: a human driver would have 100% hit that woman also
[4/2/18, 1:33:48 PM] Dan Watts: The new news is that passenger complained system wasn't working before accident. Who knows if true
[4/2/18, 1:34:02 PM] Miller: like yes you would like to think the autopilot is going to prevent all future accidents but that is unrealistic, people are terrible drivers generally speaking, no doubt over a large sample size autopilot will be safer
[4/2/18, 1:34:43 PM] Miller: 900 million people die every day in car accidents w/humans behind the wheel, 1 person dies from a robot car and everyone loses their minds
[4/2/18, 1:35:35 PM] Miller: i read some good explanation of it, people dont like to die with things that are "out of their control", they can justify/rationalize it if they are in control, same reason people are much more scared to fly despite it being statistically way safer than driving
[4/2/18, 1:37:08 PM] Fberg: doesnt the idea of self-driving car only become truly safer for everyone on the road when everyone has a self-driving car, otherwise how does a self-driving car prepare for the incredible amount of terrible drivers on the road?
[4/2/18, 1:37:37 PM] Miller: while that would be ideal i think it can still be incrementally safer even if everyone else is human
[4/2/18, 1:37:37 PM] Launchpad: with cameras and sensors
[4/2/18, 1:37:43 PM] Miller: eliminates reaction time
[4/2/18, 1:37:51 PM] Launchpad: and low latency reactions & decision making
[4/2/18, 1:38:31 PM] Dan Watts: Tesla down 22% in march
[4/2/18, 1:38:35 PM] Fberg: yea i guess incrementally safer is good, still seems like it will never be as safe as autoflying planes
[4/2/18, 1:38:43 PM] Launchpad: all tech is down big
[4/2/18, 1:38:54 PM] Fberg: just too many cars on the road compared with planes in the sky
[4/2/18, 1:39:43 PM] Fberg: NY still has ban on all hand-free driving too, seems like a large market where they cannot be used
[4/2/18, 1:40:23 PM] Miller: its early
[4/2/18, 1:40:31 PM] Miller: they arent really an option anywhere realistically
[4/2/18, 1:40:56 PM] Miller: im sure eventually ny will get on board, obviously the TLC lobby has 0 power/influence
[4/2/18, 2:03:22 PM] Justin: isnt the idea that the system should have picked it up though?
[4/2/18, 2:03:38 PM] Justin: human element aside
[4/2/18, 2:15:26 PM] Fberg: so if the auto pilot system cannot prevent the car from crashing into a concrete divider, providing 5 seconds of visual notice for the driver, and the driver still has to be the one to physically avoid the collision, whats the point of the system?
[4/2/18, 2:16:03 PM] Fberg: i assume the only people who would use this auto pilot system are people who are tired/drunk
[4/2/18, 2:16:15 PM] Fberg: or high
[4/2/18, 2:18:12 PM] Launchpad: and the thousands of people already using it
[4/2/18, 2:18:38 PM] Fberg: but why though
[4/2/18, 2:18:58 PM] Fberg: if you have to be alert and paying attention, why use the system at all?
[4/2/18, 2:19:14 PM] Justin: is this true?
[4/2/18, 2:19:19 PM] Fberg: yes
[4/2/18, 2:19:22 PM] Fberg: i just read it
[4/2/18, 2:19:45 PM] Fberg: they actually require/encourage the drivers hands to be on the wheel at all times
[4/2/18, 2:20:00 PM] Justin: wait the system cant hit the breaks when it detects an object?
[4/2/18, 2:20:00 PM] Miller: of course they encourage it
[4/2/18, 2:20:05 PM] Miller: also the tesla hit a woman
[4/2/18, 2:20:07 PM] Miller: who ran in front of it
[4/2/18, 2:20:08 PM] Miller: at night
[4/2/18, 2:20:10 PM] Miller: on a highway
[4/2/18, 2:20:25 PM] Justin: ok but the point is at night should or shouldnt effect the detection mechanisms
[4/2/18, 2:20:32 PM] Fberg: i dont understand why the system doesnt stop the car, if it can't do that much then why is it being used at all?
[4/2/18, 2:20:37 PM] Justin: thats an important fucken question
[4/2/18, 2:20:41 PM] Miller: tesla is saying it should have stopped
[4/2/18, 2:20:47 PM] Miller: that is not the debate
[4/2/18, 2:20:50 PM] Miller: it malfunctioned
[4/2/18, 2:21:01 PM] Fberg: just like a person essentially
[4/2/18, 2:21:08 PM] Miller: my only point is a human was not stopping that car either
[4/2/18, 2:21:09 PM] Justin: so now if im a lawyer, iw ant to know how often is it malfunctioning in these trial runs
[4/2/18, 2:21:31 PM] Justin: i have no argument to that
[4/2/18, 2:21:53 PM] Justin: But that doesnt mean that human drivers arent the ones that are making these trials successful
[4/2/18, 2:22:19 PM] Fberg: so now whos at fault for this woman dying? the company whos system failed to operate properly or the person who failed to stop the collision while relying on the system?
[4/2/18, 2:22:41 PM] Justin: im still kinda confused, did the system warn the driver?
[4/2/18, 2:23:01 PM] Justin: and thats really all the system can do, warn the driver?
[4/2/18, 2:23:15 PM] Justin: because if thats the case, the entire trial stats are irrelevant
[4/2/18, 2:23:27 PM] Fberg: the one i read about, collision in Silicon Valley, the system provided visual warnings for the driver for full 5 seconds that the car was heading towards a collison
[4/2/18, 2:23:44 PM] Fberg: dont know why the car didnt stop in those 5 seconds
[4/2/18, 2:23:57 PM] Fberg: and dont know why the guy didnt turn the wheel or jam on brakes
[4/2/18, 2:24:30 PM] Fberg: but the car's black box recorded the pictures taken by the system, showing there was enough time to react
[4/2/18, 2:25:31 PM] Fberg: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/03/30/tesla-says-autopilot-self-driving-system-engaged-fatal-crash/475346002/
[4/2/18, 2:25:38 PM] Miller: yea different crash
[4/2/18, 2:26:08 PM] Miller: clearly this car has the technology to stop itself and it should have
[4/2/18, 2:28:40 PM] Fberg: just kinda shocking these systems can still have this level of malfunction when its already being used in public
[4/2/18, 2:29:03 PM] Miller: i get it but what is the alternative?
[4/2/18, 2:29:11 PM] Fberg: dont use the system in public yet
[4/2/18, 2:29:11 PM] Miller: they unfortunately need to be tested in real life situations
[4/2/18, 2:29:25 PM] Miller: if you dont want to take that risk, dont?
[4/2/18, 2:29:29 PM] Fberg: this seems like a unjustified level  of risk
[4/2/18, 2:29:45 PM] Miller: nobody is putting a gun to someones head and forcing them into a tesla and forcing them into autopilot mode and forcing them to not pay attention?
[4/2/18, 2:30:11 PM] Fberg: i drive on the road too
[4/2/18, 2:30:19 PM] Fberg: you want to test this system out go for it
[4/2/18, 2:30:20 PM] Miller: people volunteer to be shot into space in the name of science, presumably a high degree of risk in that as well, i trust there is no shortage of people who would be happy to volunteer for this
[4/2/18, 2:30:26 PM] Fberg: if im driving next to you, then heck no
[4/2/18, 2:30:42 PM] Fberg: thats my issue, i didnt sign up to be around this
[4/2/18, 2:31:03 PM] Miller: you assume a certain level of risk anytime you drive anywhere
[4/2/18, 2:31:14 PM] Fberg: yea, knowing what the risks are
[4/2/18, 2:31:16 PM] Launchpad: they are safer than normal cars
[4/2/18, 2:31:18 PM] Fberg: i know people suck at driving
[4/2/18, 2:31:25 PM] Miller: i dont think over a large sample size the risk of driving next to a beta version tesla on autopilot is any higher than driving next to a human
[4/2/18, 2:31:29 PM] Fberg: opinion
[4/2/18, 2:31:30 PM] Miller: my guess would be it is substantially lower
[4/2/18, 2:31:43 PM] Miller: the difference is anything that happens with these cars is a national news story
[4/2/18, 2:32:08 PM] Fberg: thats good, poeple need to know the level of malfunction possible with these cars
[4/2/18, 2:32:19 PM] Launchpad: lower than human
[4/2/18, 2:32:36 PM] Fberg: yea, i guess
[4/2/18, 2:33:29 PM] Fberg: if someone is relying on these systems to drive to work, and they avoid realizing theres a concrete wall directly in front of them, then this system is possibly as useless as a terrible driver
[4/2/18, 2:33:41 PM] Fberg: i realize it wont be that way forever, it will improve
[4/2/18, 2:35:47 PM] Fberg: im curious, if you compare the testing of self-driving cars with pharmaceutical  testing of drugs on human subjects, what level of risk is acceptable in regards to how much damage it could cause to the subjects?
[4/2/18, 2:37:51 PM] Miller: repeat that?
[4/2/18, 2:40:28 PM] Fberg: how many people die from pharmaceutical drug testing
[4/2/18, 2:41:17 PM] Miller: probably very few? i have no idea
[4/2/18, 2:42:10 PM] Miller: the issue in analyzing deaths related to autopilot is you need to subjectively adjust for how many of those deaths would have occurred with a human driver as well
[4/2/18, 2:42:11 PM] Launchpad: how many die from pharma approved opioids?
[4/2/18, 2:42:16 PM] Miller: like that woman in the highway
[4/2/18, 2:43:13 PM] Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtTB8hTgHbM graphic content warning
[4/2/18, 2:43:21 PM] Fberg: im reading that its a very low % of drug testing that ends because of "harm" to the subjects
[4/2/18, 2:43:24 PM] Miller: im just saying i would also have hit that woman most likely
[4/2/18, 2:44:07 PM] Miller: so while i will say yes autopilot SHOULD have stopped the car and it clearly did not work as intended i dont put that womans death in my mind as a result of the autopilot
[4/2/18, 2:45:15 PM] Fberg: my issue is that people are stupid and will rely on this system much more than they probably should, like not keeping their hands on the wheel, while being drunk, etc
[4/2/18, 2:45:41 PM] Fberg: so if the systems can still make these mistakes, maybe they shouldnt be at this stage of testing yet
[4/2/18, 2:46:09 PM] Fberg: cause we are all at risk, not just those that assumed the specific risk of driving around in a self-driving car
[4/2/18, 2:46:21 PM] Miller: how many people died building the railroads?
[4/2/18, 2:46:26 PM] Launchpad: and what about stupid people crossing the street without looking for cars
[4/2/18, 2:46:27 PM] Fberg: many
[4/2/18, 2:46:45 PM] Miller: gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelette
[4/2/18, 2:46:59 PM] Fberg: so self-driving car is as successful at avoiding stupid humans as we all are
[4/2/18, 2:47:01 PM] Launchpad: @16312353198 just wants to sue somebody
[4/2/18, 2:47:03 PM] Fberg: sounds like a winner
[4/2/18, 2:47:24 PM] Miller: it seems unrealistic to me to expect tesla to build a 2nd-earth full of robots and roads/cities to test these cars
[4/2/18, 2:47:25 PM] Justin: agree with fberg
[4/2/18, 2:47:33 PM] Justin: these are being amrketed as like 0 fatalities
[4/2/18, 2:47:35 PM] Justin: 100 effective
[4/2/18, 2:47:47 PM] Justin: even this ...1st fatality
[4/2/18, 2:47:52 PM] Miller: i cant speak to the marketing, i didnt even think it was consumer ready
[4/2/18, 2:47:57 PM] Fberg: i dont want to be in the other car when one of these machines, being used by a stupid human, doesn't stop and kills me
[4/2/18, 2:48:03 PM] Miller: i thought it was still acknowledged to be in testing phase
[4/2/18, 2:48:09 PM] Justin: news stories everywhere talk about how amazing its doing all testing progras
[4/2/18, 2:48:19 PM] Miller: i dont want to be in the car next to a truck driver who hasnt slept in 28 hours
[4/2/18, 2:48:35 PM] Justin: I agree with that
[4/2/18, 2:48:37 PM] Justin: as well
[4/2/18, 2:49:01 PM] Fberg: yea but if this system doesnt work all the time, then you are still at risk, and the truck driver assuming this system will keep him safe, will rely on it rather than pay attention
[4/2/18, 2:49:27 PM] Fberg: its providing an escape from accountability for the driver
[4/2/18, 2:49:34 PM] Justin: yeh the system failing to see an object at night time, is not a good thing for the system
[4/2/18, 2:49:51 PM] Justin: it doesnt see things with human eyes, its disingenuous to pretend it does
[4/2/18, 2:50:36 PM] Fberg: and if these systems already come with instructions to keep your hands on the wheel at all times, shouldnt we be asking ourselves why?
[4/2/18, 2:50:40 PM] Launchpad: it works 99.9% of the time you are just focusing on outliers
[4/2/18, 2:50:42 PM] Justin: it means there are flaws in the algorithms, presumably major ones...but one would really need to see the data to have any idea how effective it is at this point
[4/2/18, 2:50:52 PM] Justin: thats pure speuclation
[4/2/18, 2:51:35 PM] Justin: if these are outliers, then sure
[4/2/18, 2:52:08 PM] Justin: could be so lawyers like you cant attack
[4/2/18, 2:52:16 PM] Fberg: these systems arent suppose to be a complete replacement for a human operator
[4/2/18, 2:52:35 PM] Justin: maybe they are, disclaimer still shields them from liabiilty i would think
[4/2/18, 2:52:53 PM] Fberg: so the exhausted truck driver is still suppose to be awake and attentive at the wheel
[4/2/18, 2:53:00 PM] Fberg: the drunk driver still isnt suppose to drive
[4/2/18, 2:53:40 PM] Miller: ding ding ding
[4/2/18, 2:53:53 PM] Fberg: this system gives false sense of security and like everyone agrees, people are stupid and our stupidity shouldnt be shocking
[4/2/18, 2:54:34 PM] Fberg: so his hands arent on the wheel, but lawyers would ignore the fact that the system failed to detect a HUMAN BEING  on the road?
[4/2/18, 2:54:50 PM] Justin: pretty sure considering drunk driver can take over at anytime, he shouldnt drive anyway
[4/2/18, 2:55:14 PM] Fberg: yet drunk poeple who shouldnt be driving, still drive
[4/2/18, 2:55:40 PM] Justin: no, im in agreement here with you
[4/2/18, 2:56:00 PM] Launchpad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjGe0GiiFzw
[4/2/18, 2:56:06 PM] Justin: that seems like a major failure, how common is it at this point?
[4/2/18, 2:56:20 PM] Justin: cant watch the video right now, sum it up
[4/2/18, 2:56:29 PM] Miller: i am not getting involved in the legal aspect b/c i have no fucking clue, but objectively speaking if you think over the next million years this technology will massively improve human life and save countless lives but you also have an issue with the testing required to get there then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[4/2/18, 2:56:58 PM] Justin: on board with that
[4/2/18, 2:57:15 PM] Justin: doesnt shield companies from liability though
[4/2/18, 2:57:16 PM] Launchpad: Its not Herman Approved TM
[4/2/18, 2:57:50 PM] Justin: hyperbole follows, i mean eugenics would help the earth as well..
[4/2/18, 2:57:55 PM] Fberg: within first 5 seconds of video, an alert driver, while using the auto pilot system, misses out on a accident, but admist to "taking over control" of the car
[4/2/18, 2:58:41 PM] Justin: yeh this has to take away from "the results"
[4/2/18, 2:58:59 PM] Justin: how often is that happening
[4/2/18, 2:59:18 PM] Justin: how often are there even scary situations like that
[4/2/18, 3:00:02 PM] Fberg: i think that people will abuse the system and that a requirement to be alert and keep your hands on the wheel is more than just an attempt to be shielded from liability, its required because they dont want people to assume a self-driving system fully replaces the need for an actual human operator behind the wheel
[4/2/18, 3:00:25 PM] Fberg: why do we still have human pilots in planes?
[4/2/18, 3:00:32 PM] Fberg: why are they not suppose to be drunk?
[4/2/18, 3:01:00 PM] Launchpad: the software is pretty much flying the planes these days
[4/2/18, 3:01:19 PM] Fberg: when was last time you were on a plane that had no human pilot?
[4/2/18, 3:01:32 PM] Fberg: thats my point
[4/2/18, 3:01:40 PM] Fberg: and we all agree how stupid people are
[4/2/18, 3:02:00 PM] Justin: to a large degree though this may be for more psychological reasons
[4/2/18, 3:02:24 PM] Justin: like computers can probably do a better job than most doctors at diagnosis of disease now, but noone wants to hear about their blood results from a computer
[4/2/18, 3:03:13 PM] Justin: i did watch the sully movie though, and computer was wrong there
[4/2/18, 3:03:17 PM] Justin: accoridng to movie at least
[4/2/18, 3:03:32 PM] Miller: i still dont even know what your argument or point is?
[4/2/18, 3:04:04 PM] Fberg: @15166335046 i think that people will abuse the system and that a requirement to be alert and keep your hands on the wheel is more than just an attempt to be shielded from liability, its required because they dont want people to assume a self-driving system fully replaces the need for an actual human operator behind the wheel
[4/2/18, 3:04:11 PM] Justin: i want to see the data, i want to see how far along the tech is...that would be my point
[4/2/18, 3:04:20 PM] Miller: i agree with that
[4/2/18, 3:04:54 PM] Miller: but even with people abusing it i still would rather have a computer driving than a person
[4/2/18, 3:05:06 PM] Miller: i would be fine if these self driving cars didnt even have wheels
[4/2/18, 3:05:08 PM] Fberg: one day, i will agree with you
[4/2/18, 3:05:16 PM] Miller: (steering wheels lol)
[4/2/18, 3:06:26 PM] Launchpad: im not at the steering wheel point yet but I do agree, self-driving cars will replace humans starting with communists & socialists
[4/2/18, 3:07:08 PM] Miller: i hear nisaans will be the first cars to be replaced
[4/2/18, 3:08:14 PM] Launchpad: red paint will no longer be offered
[4/2/18, 3:09:52 PM] Fberg: if they want to replace my 2008 Nissan Altima with a self-driving Nissan then im down
[4/2/18, 3:11:40 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/2/18, 3:12:07 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/2/18, 3:12:41 PM] Scott: no steering wheel freaks me out
[4/2/18, 3:12:45 PM] Fberg: why even bother with windows?
[4/2/18, 3:13:18 PM] Launchpad: why do we have windows in our houses?
[4/2/18, 3:13:28 PM] Fberg: paying for the view
[4/2/18, 3:13:53 PM] Fberg: car is for travel purposes
[4/2/18, 3:14:04 PM] Fberg: should just remove the parts that arent necessary for the purpose
[4/2/18, 3:14:43 PM] Launchpad: house is for living puposes, not viewing purposes
[4/2/18, 3:15:46 PM] Fberg: yea you're right, well i guess we can extend the purpose of windows for ventilation
[4/2/18, 3:16:24 PM] Justin: of course the roads they test those cars us will be built by socialists, and the tax breaks they get for pushing the technology will be given by sociliasts
[4/2/18, 3:16:24 PM] Fberg: but a modern self-driving car will have temp control, so windows are needed
[4/2/18, 3:16:42 PM] Fberg: arent*
[4/2/18, 3:17:42 PM] Justin: fberg probbaly right in that windows will become led displays, their is no functional value for them
[4/2/18, 3:18:35 PM] Fberg: i assume all of this is coming from LP's expectation that humans wont be necessary in any way to operate a vehicle
[4/2/18, 3:18:59 PM] Justin: the reality has to be they wont be at some point
[4/2/18, 3:19:36 PM] Justin: but who knows how far away from that we really are, so yeh like you say im sure the hands on the wheel is not just to shield from liability.
[4/2/18, 3:19:41 PM] Fberg: so why not just lock us up in a steel cage with no windows, no wheel, and not give us any way of operating the vehicle?  it would be the safest way possible to keep human error from causing another accident
[4/2/18, 3:19:54 PM] Justin: eventually that may be the case
[4/2/18, 3:20:06 PM] Justin: for now, clearly its not even close
[4/2/18, 3:20:44 PM] Fberg: thhought we are operating at a 99.9% safety rate with these self-driving cars?
[4/2/18, 3:21:06 PM] Launchpad: Nothing of any substance was ever built by a socialist
[4/2/18, 3:22:23 PM] Justin: lol
[4/2/18, 3:24:16 PM] Justin: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/yes-government-researchers-really-did-invent-the-internet/
[4/2/18, 3:24:29 PM] Justin: üßê
[4/2/18, 3:26:29 PM] Justin: perhaps if your mind could expand beyond putting things into black and white boxes, you would move beyond your contempt for "socialism".
[4/2/18, 3:28:00 PM] Launchpad: no I just said that to fuck with you
[4/2/18, 3:28:11 PM] Launchpad: if you want to expand your mind you should really learn more about EOS
[4/2/18, 3:28:16 PM] Justin: lol
[4/2/18, 3:28:21 PM] Justin: you win this round
[4/2/18, 3:28:32 PM] Launchpad: EOS creator Dan Larimer is all for UBI
[4/2/18, 3:50:40 PM] Donk: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/2/18, 3:51:12 PM] Launchpad: lol
[4/2/18, 3:51:19 PM] Launchpad: such hate
[4/2/18, 3:51:50 PM] Donk: Its in the Chuck klosterman book im reading
[4/2/18, 3:53:10 PM] Launchpad: Chuck knows some good music
[4/2/18, 3:53:45 PM] Dan Watts: I read sex drugs and coco puffs back in the day
[4/2/18, 3:54:01 PM] Dan Watts: Awesome book, the short story about the cover band is epic
[4/2/18, 3:54:50 PM] Dan Watts: It was a guns and roses tribute band
[4/2/18, 3:55:11 PM] Launchpad: he really could have picked a much uglier crowd. Dream Theater crowds are mostly preppie college kids than say some death metal band
[4/2/18, 4:06:24 PM] Donk: Sex drugs and coco puffs is great
[4/2/18, 4:06:45 PM] Donk: Im reading his most recent essay/article compilation book
[4/2/18, 7:38:43 PM] Launchpad: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/2/18, 7:40:44 PM] Fberg: he thinks the guy is Hispanic....def Cheese

[4/3/18, 9:32:02 AM] Brian Katz: He does look like shit. But home slice is funny.
[4/3/18, 11:16:00 AM] Scott: so uh, lets go nova!
[4/3/18, 11:16:29 AM] Miller: didnt realize you went there
[4/3/18, 11:35:49 AM] Scott: lolz, from there, been fan for a long long time
[4/3/18, 11:35:58 AM] Scott: also took a class there
[4/3/18, 11:36:23 AM] Miller: youre from there? that explains why you are a 76ers, eagles, and phillies fan also
[4/3/18, 11:36:33 AM] Scott: lolz such a troll
[4/3/18, 11:36:39 AM] Scott: always has been, always will be.
[4/3/18, 11:36:52 AM] Miller: just like you being a nova fan üòÇ
[4/3/18, 11:37:04 AM] Miller: is it march? is nova in the finals? if so cheese is a nova fan
[4/3/18, 11:46:07 AM] Kiyoon: yeah man, only knock I will have on you is that you haven't said a thing about Nova all season until yesterday morning lol
[4/3/18, 11:46:21 AM] Kiyoon: but, I will verify that Cheese has been a NOVA fan for, at least since college
[4/3/18, 11:46:52 AM] Scott: I have. I've watched about the last 20 games.
[4/3/18, 11:47:08 AM] Kiyoon: that I do not believe
[4/3/18, 11:47:17 AM] Kiyoon: you mean last 2.0 games
[4/3/18, 11:47:22 AM] Kiyoon: is there a decimal point you are missing?
[4/3/18, 11:47:24 AM] Scott: I've watched tourney games
[4/3/18, 11:47:35 AM] Scott: The big east tourney games and went to one
[4/3/18, 11:47:44 AM] Scott: And watched the last 10ish before that
[4/3/18, 11:47:51 AM] Scott: And some earlier in the year.
[4/3/18, 11:49:46 AM] Kiyoon: aight cheese, without looking it up, who did they lose to in the last 20 games you watched?
[4/3/18, 11:49:52 AM] Kiyoon: you have 5 seconds
[4/3/18, 11:50:04 AM] Miller: st johns
[4/3/18, 11:50:06 AM] Miller: boom
[4/3/18, 11:50:07 AM] Kiyoon: too late dawg
[4/3/18, 11:50:12 AM] Miller: biggest nova fan you know
[4/3/18, 11:50:17 AM] Kiyoon: cheese, not a real fan
[4/3/18, 11:50:28 AM] Miller: they lost to 3 big east teams this year
[4/3/18, 11:51:38 AM] Scott: Huh
[4/3/18, 11:51:40 AM] Scott: Creighton
[4/3/18, 11:51:41 AM] Scott: Xavier
[4/3/18, 11:51:46 AM] Scott: St johns
[4/3/18, 11:52:35 AM] Scott: Notwithstanding that, I need not prove anything here. Just excited. They showed a street a few blocks from my parents house with ppl shooting off flairs and climbing street signs. Crazy.
[4/3/18, 11:53:00 AM] Kiyoon: I mean if you had watched the last 20 games
[4/3/18, 11:53:05 AM] Kiyoon: you'd know they lost to Butler
[4/3/18, 11:53:06 AM] Scott: I can use the bathroom and ignore you for a second lol
[4/3/18, 11:53:31 AM] Kiyoon: they also never lost to Xavier
[4/3/18, 11:53:59 AM] Scott: Again I need not prove anything to u.
[4/3/18, 11:54:11 AM] Scott: U of anyone know that I'm a nova fan.
[4/3/18, 11:54:17 AM] Scott: As I know u like cuse
[4/3/18, 11:54:27 AM] Kiyoon: i'll agree, you are definitely a nova fan
[4/3/18, 11:54:38 AM] Kiyoon: but I'll say you watched the last 2 games of the tourney, not the last 20
[4/3/18, 11:55:24 AM] Miller: as well know i am a notre dame womens basketball fan

[4/4/18, 12:23:44 PM] Launchpad: purely a function of not hitting sales goals and having enough work to do
[4/4/18, 12:24:59 PM] Launchpad: the irony is that I've always worked on paying contracts and made the company a nice healthy profit on my work, and we are investing a lot of money trying to launch our own product which is in a pilot program in a couple hospitals
[4/4/18, 12:27:57 PM] Launchpad: 2 weeks severance + ~9 days of vacation == almost a month of paid not working

[4/4/18, 2:14:47 PM] Fberg: Yankee fans already booing Stanton after one game with 5 K's??
[4/4/18, 2:15:48 PM] Miller: new herman
[4/4/18, 2:16:02 PM] Fberg: when was it mentioned?
[4/4/18, 2:16:16 PM] Miller: last night
[4/4/18, 2:16:52 PM] Miller: to be fair apparently the headline didnt say he was booed which is weird b/c it did when i clicked on it, b/c that was why i clicked on it
[4/4/18, 2:16:55 PM] Miller: ill allow a pass
[4/4/18, 2:17:33 PM] Fberg: got buried around the complete lie that is LP's emoji
[4/4/18, 2:18:06 PM] Miller: i thought that was drew
[4/4/18, 2:18:27 PM] Fberg: and i totally agree, LP and Drew look nothing alike yet could be identical twins according to the emoji
[4/4/18, 2:18:54 PM] Scott: Both white. Boom. Roasted.
[4/4/18, 2:19:44 PM] Fberg: but back to the question, you yankee fans already sick of seeing stanton strike out?  guy aint going anywhere and very doubtful his strikeout rate improves much as he gets older
[4/4/18, 2:20:47 PM] Miller: supposedly i heard it was like 10 yankee fans
[4/4/18, 2:23:35 PM] Fberg: oh damn, we got fake news'd?
[4/4/18, 2:25:36 PM] Justin: pretty sure ynakees fans who cheer on judge with like 300 k's are fine with stnaton
[4/4/18, 2:26:22 PM] Launchpad: lookin forward to all the jerkin off
[4/4/18, 2:29:12 PM] Fberg: what if both judge and stanton K rates go up
[4/4/18, 2:29:37 PM] Fberg: technically i realize that judge already K'd the most last year
[4/4/18, 2:30:09 PM] Fberg: but stanton is usually up there with league leaders and the guy is always hurt (other than last year)
[4/4/18, 2:31:16 PM] Fberg: also a shame what happened with Fernandez on the Marlins, im sure he would have been on the yankees once jeter took control as well
[4/4/18, 2:31:37 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôll take that with the 100 plus walks and 50 plays home rubs
[4/4/18, 2:31:43 PM] Brian Katz: Runs*
[4/4/18, 2:31:59 PM] Brian Katz: Plus*
[4/4/18, 2:33:09 PM] Fberg: you also have Didi, sure he will be up there with HR's too
[4/4/18, 2:33:27 PM] Brian Katz: Yup
[4/4/18, 2:33:32 PM] Brian Katz: And Sanchez
[4/4/18, 2:33:33 PM] Justin: yeh, big shame, almost like profiting for years from a ponzi scheme
[4/4/18, 2:33:48 PM] Justin: and being rewarded with a new stadium
[4/4/18, 2:33:56 PM] Fberg: well the mets fan didnt profit from the scheme
[4/4/18, 2:34:06 PM] Fberg: mets fans incurred a detriment
[4/4/18, 2:34:43 PM] Brian Katz: No one profits from being a meta fan. The more you know GI-JOE!!!
[4/4/18, 2:34:51 PM] Brian Katz: Mets*
[4/4/18, 2:37:01 PM] Justin: i mean stantons no trade clause presumably left jeter with like 5 options
[4/4/18, 2:37:08 PM] Fberg: $615 million in taxpayer subsidies help pay for citi
[4/4/18, 2:37:13 PM] Justin: so random dart would mean there was still 20% shot
[4/4/18, 2:37:28 PM] Fberg: not sure where the ponzi scheme built the stadium
[4/4/18, 2:37:47 PM] Justin: *rewarded with
[4/4/18, 2:38:02 PM] Justin: not sure where i said it did
[4/4/18, 2:38:25 PM] Fberg: [2:33 PM, 4/4/2018] Herman: yeh, big shame, almost like profiting for years from a ponzi scheme
[2:33 PM, 4/4/2018] Herman: and being rewarded with a new stadium
[4/4/18, 2:38:40 PM] Justin: profiting from ponzi scheme.........being rewarded with new stadium
[4/4/18, 2:38:47 PM] Justin: where do i say profits from ponzi scheme pay for stadium
[4/4/18, 2:39:01 PM] Fberg: im confused then
[4/4/18, 2:39:04 PM] Justin: in fact rewarde dmeans being given, not paying for
[4/4/18, 2:39:27 PM] Fberg: so how did the mets fan reap a reward from the wilpons?
[4/4/18, 2:39:31 PM] Fberg: im confused
[4/4/18, 2:39:35 PM] Justin: i was being an ashsole and setting up a rediculous strawman
[4/4/18, 2:40:12 PM] Justin: now im confused, define reward?
[4/4/18, 2:40:23 PM] Fberg: it was your comment
[4/4/18, 2:40:24 PM] Justin: what reward do fans ever receive?
[4/4/18, 2:40:28 PM] Fberg: how do i define a word you used
[4/4/18, 2:40:38 PM] Justin: i meant the wilpons
[4/4/18, 2:40:46 PM] Justin: your comment was about Jeter and insdier trading
[4/4/18, 2:41:10 PM] Justin: i made a rediculous strawman of the WIlpons and profiting form ponzi shceme, and then being given a tax subsidized statidum
[4/4/18, 2:41:45 PM] Fberg: all my comments were about yankee fans
[4/4/18, 2:41:59 PM] Justin: also a shame what happened with Fernandez on the Marlins, im sure he would have been on the yankees once jeter took control as well
[4/4/18, 2:42:06 PM] Fberg: i actually agree with you, idk where else stanton could have actually gone
[4/4/18, 2:42:18 PM] Fberg: just easy to say its because of the jeter connection
[4/4/18, 2:42:35 PM] Brian Katz: Mets blow
[4/4/18, 2:42:56 PM] Fberg: yea, obviously
[4/4/18, 2:43:16 PM] Justin: thats the comment i was responding to
[4/4/18, 2:43:32 PM] Justin: also a shame what happened with Fernandez on the Marlins, im sure he would have been on the yankees once jeter took control as well.........[2:33 PM, 4/4/2018] +1 (631) 662-0763: yeh, big shame, almost like profiting for years from a ponzi scheme
[2:33 PM, 4/4/2018] +1 (631) 662-0763: and being rewarded with a new stadium
[4/4/18, 2:43:49 PM] Fberg: whats the connection between this and the ponzi scheme that netted the mets fan nothing
[4/4/18, 2:44:02 PM] Fberg: payroll decreased as a result of the madoff shit
[4/4/18, 2:44:20 PM] Fberg: and then we, taxpayers, footed the bill for the new stadium
[4/4/18, 2:44:59 PM] Fberg: all around the country the taxpayers have been paying for new stadiums
[4/4/18, 2:45:10 PM] Justin: im just being critical of the use of the word shame contextually......jeter giving palyers to the yankees isnt more shameful than profiting off ponzi scheme and then havintg taxpayers apy for new stadium
[4/4/18, 2:45:46 PM] Fberg: i agree
[4/4/18, 2:45:59 PM] Justin: its deliberate straw man, because A I don't know if Wilpons profitted or not and B. it's nonsesne to imply the driving factor in Stanton deal was dumping palyers to yankees
[4/4/18, 2:46:08 PM] Fberg: but one has to do with actual on the field baseball and the other is political
[4/4/18, 2:46:27 PM] Fberg: its not nonsense
[4/4/18, 2:46:42 PM] Fberg: the yankees are one of few teams he would go to and who had the ability and desire to pay the remaining money left on his deal
[4/4/18, 2:46:45 PM] Justin: it disreguards how few options he had
[4/4/18, 2:46:51 PM] Fberg: i get that
[4/4/18, 2:47:00 PM] Fberg: like i also said, it makes sense how he got to the yankees
[4/4/18, 2:47:03 PM] Justin: did it make the deal go easier, sure it did
[4/4/18, 2:47:20 PM] Justin: but it's not like he was gonna dump fernandez as well to ynakees
[4/4/18, 2:47:52 PM] Justin: these points really didn't get across well over the itnernet
[4/4/18, 2:47:52 PM] Fberg: my larger hypothetical was that had fernandez still been alive, he would also be a member of the yankees because jeter
[4/4/18, 2:48:09 PM] Fberg: key word HYPOTHETICAL
[4/4/18, 2:48:11 PM] Justin: i get that, and that implies a sense of homecooking yankee bias
[4/4/18, 2:48:17 PM] Fberg: of course
[4/4/18, 2:48:46 PM] Fberg: just hope that if something like that did happen, MLB would step in like NBA did years ago with a chris paul trade
[4/4/18, 2:49:41 PM] Justin: yeh im not buying the whole conspiracy theory here.
[4/4/18, 2:50:38 PM] Justin: incentives and connections, surely.  Doesn't mean the marlins are dumping there team to the yankees bc jeter is life long yankee
[4/4/18, 2:51:10 PM] Miller: the NBA stepped in b/c the NBA at that time owned the hornets who were involved in that trade
[4/4/18, 2:51:29 PM] Miller: it wasnt for anti-competitive reasons or w/e
[4/4/18, 2:51:57 PM] Donk: There still is no good reason for why they vetod that trade
[4/4/18, 2:52:17 PM] Launchpad: you are the king of demanding that people give you things
[4/4/18, 2:52:33 PM] Miller: i dont disagree but to compare it to MLB hypothetically blocking a "bad" trade is silly
[4/4/18, 2:52:48 PM] Donk: The only valid reason is that they had just come off that lockout where they wanted to stop big market teams from getting all of the big free agents and as such, vetoed it keep paul from the lakers
[4/4/18, 2:52:51 PM] Miller: the mets could trade syndergaard for a backup catcher and nobody in the lg could do shit but complain
[4/4/18, 2:54:28 PM] Justin: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[4/4/18, 2:54:51 PM] Fberg: so NBA prevented a trade for a reason....everyone doesnt even agree they should have...but they did
[4/4/18, 2:55:02 PM] Brian Katz: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[4/4/18, 2:55:05 PM] Fberg: point being that mlb could step in a prevent a trade as well
[4/4/18, 2:55:16 PM] Miller: sure, anything could happen
[4/4/18, 2:55:21 PM] Miller: there is literally 0 precedent for it
[4/4/18, 2:55:24 PM] Miller: so good luck with that
[4/4/18, 2:55:28 PM] Justin: katz got it
[4/4/18, 2:55:40 PM] Brian Katz: You are in the firm belief that no teams should trade.
[4/4/18, 2:55:46 PM] Fberg: and like someone likes to point out with a certain commissioner in a certain league, seems like they can do whatever they want
[4/4/18, 2:55:51 PM] Miller: lmao
[4/4/18, 2:55:55 PM] Miller: it extends far reaching
[4/4/18, 2:56:28 PM] Fberg: glad you got the farm system in check millz, dont let the help rise up
[4/4/18, 2:56:43 PM] Fberg: bad for business
[4/4/18, 2:57:49 PM] Miller: always gotta be some conspiracy theory if someone disagrees w/you, cant be b/c they just disagree w/you
[4/4/18, 2:57:56 PM] Miller: i actually stole katz phone
[4/4/18, 2:57:58 PM] Miller: and im typing for him
[4/4/18, 2:58:41 PM] Fberg: lol
[4/4/18, 2:59:25 PM] Fberg: its easy to explain things that dont make sense as a conspiracy
[4/4/18, 2:59:58 PM] Fberg: but i dont consider your fantasy moves as conspiracy, just poor trades for the teams you trade with, sometimes
[4/4/18, 3:02:49 PM] Justin: üëç
[4/4/18, 3:04:26 PM] Justin: just wait until I trade miller engram for gronk
[4/4/18, 3:04:55 PM] Justin: nothing firm yet, things are brewing though
[4/4/18, 3:05:05 PM] Miller: its engram and a 1st
[4/4/18, 3:05:11 PM] Miller: dont try to change it now
[4/4/18, 3:05:26 PM] Miller: and its contingent upon gronk retiring
[4/4/18, 3:06:24 PM] Brian Katz: If you traded a 1st to Miller, Fienberg would lose his mind
[4/4/18, 3:06:50 PM] Miller: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[4/4/18, 3:07:08 PM] Miller: also, if true if i trade a 1st to someone else
[4/4/18, 3:07:33 PM] Justin: the reality is the league does kinda suck and we should start another one
[4/4/18, 3:07:40 PM] Justin: there is no catching up to miller at this point
[4/4/18, 3:07:40 PM] Miller: get on it
[4/4/18, 3:07:50 PM] Justin: i wanst invited into league 2
[4/4/18, 3:08:02 PM] Justin: do people have stomach for league 3
[4/4/18, 3:08:04 PM] Miller: im always down to add another lg into my portfolio
[4/4/18, 3:09:04 PM] Brian Katz: I‚Äôm in
[4/4/18, 3:09:15 PM] Brian Katz: These are the best
[4/4/18, 3:09:44 PM] Brian Katz: You should end your redraft league and make it into one of these
[4/4/18, 3:10:53 PM] Justin: as two time champ, i am not incentivized to do that
[4/4/18, 3:11:10 PM] Justin: add in current reigning champ
[4/4/18, 3:11:14 PM] Miller: would be worth it to watch steves head explode
[4/4/18, 3:12:41 PM] Donk: Also always down for another league
[4/4/18, 3:12:57 PM] Brian Katz: Yeah man league 3 let‚Äôs do it.
[4/4/18, 3:13:38 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/4/18, 3:13:47 PM] Brian Katz: Lol
[4/4/18, 3:13:59 PM] Justin: lol i got some more people that would want in im sure
[4/4/18, 3:14:06 PM] Justin: josh been bugging me to get in
[4/4/18, 3:14:13 PM] Fberg: im down for new dynasty league
[4/4/18, 3:14:16 PM] Miller: finally some competition for me
[4/4/18, 3:14:27 PM] Justin: was gonna say that lol
[4/4/18, 3:14:41 PM] Miller: get stephan and EJ in also, entertainment factor would be through the roof
[4/4/18, 3:15:00 PM] Miller: first rule you have to make in the other lg is feinberg has to lose in the finals every yr
[4/4/18, 3:15:02 PM] Justin: lol
[4/4/18, 3:15:31 PM] Fberg: and then be told by all those who didnt make the playoffs that i suck and dont know what im doing
[4/4/18, 3:15:33 PM] Miller: 2nd rule is no trading allowed
[4/4/18, 3:16:21 PM] Fberg: a league with no trading would be phenomenal
[4/4/18, 3:16:31 PM] Brian Katz: And super lame
[4/4/18, 3:16:47 PM] Fberg: millz would have to set up a new type of farm system
[4/4/18, 3:17:23 PM] Justin: he would probably make deals with teams with waiver priority somehow still
[4/4/18, 3:17:53 PM] Fberg: the key is to convvince the other team that the transaction is in their favor, then sky is the limit
[4/4/18, 3:19:12 PM] Miller: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/4/18, 3:20:15 PM] Fberg: yes, thats all it takes
[4/4/18, 3:21:15 PM] Miller: i mean theres 3 options 
1. that
2. i am killgrave from jessica jones
3. we play in a league with people so dumb i can manipulate them into doing my bidding with a 2 minute conversation via text
[4/4/18, 3:21:20 PM] Miller: take your pick
[4/4/18, 3:21:43 PM] Fberg: wow, so many great options
[4/4/18, 3:21:50 PM] Justin: i swear i sawjesica jones mom sleeping with george on seifeld episode yesteday
[4/4/18, 3:21:58 PM] Fberg: you should get a job polling for fox with those options
[4/4/18, 3:22:02 PM] Launchpad: I can name about 6 people in our league who routinely attempt to sucker me with shit trade offers and none are named @15166335046
[4/4/18, 3:22:36 PM] Fberg: same guy that makes fun of me for saying you have improved with your decisions?
[4/4/18, 3:22:42 PM] Miller: its amazing you have been able to withstand their attempts, do you just wear a professor X style helmet when you open up whatsapp?
[4/4/18, 3:23:10 PM] Launchpad: are you trolling me Im defending you lol
[4/4/18, 3:23:37 PM] Miller: lol im trolling the idea of it being difficult to not make a bad trade
[4/4/18, 3:23:52 PM] Miller: hey do this
[4/4/18, 3:23:52 PM] Miller: no
[4/4/18, 3:24:39 PM] Fberg: considering i have no interest in getting into all this nonsense again, ill repeat my initial comment...im down for another dynasty league
[4/4/18, 3:25:18 PM] Launchpad: Everyone thought the Patriots were going to win the super bowl this year too
[4/4/18, 3:25:41 PM] Launchpad: We all crowned the Pats champions after they got Cooks

[4/4/18, 3:48:16 PM] Brian Katz: Is it complicated to do this?
[4/4/18, 3:49:19 PM] Miller: its not rocket surgery
[4/4/18, 3:49:32 PM] Scott: when do we wanna do the draft?
[4/4/18, 3:49:38 PM] Brian Katz: You can perform surgery on rockets?!?

[4/4/18, 5:49:56 PM] Miller: Amateur
[4/4/18, 5:50:14 PM] Miller: Probably because of all the time I spend trolling Bernie groups tbh
[4/4/18, 5:52:58 PM] Launchpad: all this time herman kept trying to put me in a box and it was the wrong box
[4/4/18, 5:53:29 PM] Launchpad: alright well Im about to take off from work and too what unemployed people like to do: drink heavily and not give a fuck
[4/4/18, 5:54:02 PM] Miller: To be fair employed people do that also
[4/4/18, 5:54:30 PM] Launchpad: well I'm a special fucking liberal snowflake don't tell me Im like everyone else
[4/4/18, 5:54:55 PM] Fberg: sounds like you could use a safe space
[4/4/18, 5:55:39 PM] Miller: Though I occasionally give a fuck depending on the subject
[4/4/18, 5:56:51 PM] Miller: Or maybe a craft IPA

[4/4/18, 8:07:22 PM] Justin: Highest abv as well
[4/4/18, 8:08:18 PM] Miller: You know how you don't always choose ever clear when you drink vodka?
[4/4/18, 8:08:32 PM] Miller: Why is the beer choice always based on abv, who cares
[4/4/18, 8:09:32 PM] Launchpad: Lol

[4/4/18, 9:18:23 PM] Justin: dumbed down for you...they wouldnt put abv on the chalkboard if people didnt care about abv
[4/4/18, 9:22:42 PM] Launchpad: And they post calories on menus cause they want you getting triple bacon deep fried with cheese?
[4/4/18, 9:30:53 PM] Justin: yeh, or they post calories because people want to see calories just like they post abv because people want to see abv?
[4/4/18, 9:48:22 PM] Dan Watts: https://instagram.com/p/BhCuol0gL7w/

[4/5/18, 5:36:52 AM] Miller: No idea, will be over in a week so just gonna wait it out
[4/5/18, 5:37:56 AM] Miller: In my entire life I've never heard anyone besides you reference it
[4/5/18, 5:38:42 AM] Miller: Nope that's a lie, it came up that time we went to Montreal in Binghamton and we were drinking those Molson XXX
[4/5/18, 5:38:52 AM] Miller: Still, twice in 15 or so years

[4/5/18, 11:43:23 AM] Scott: http://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/23038477/william-hill-us-offers-31-prop-bets-2018-nfl-draft
[4/5/18, 11:46:10 AM] Miller: No. of WRs selected in Round 1:

Over 2.5 (-175)
Under 2.5 (+155)
[4/5/18, 11:46:17 AM] Miller: that seems massively +EV
[4/5/18, 11:52:43 AM] Brian Katz: Over
[4/5/18, 11:52:54 AM] Brian Katz: Dallas definitely taking one
[4/5/18, 11:53:07 AM] Brian Katz: Baltimore maybe
[4/5/18, 11:53:13 AM] Scott: There are 2 definitely going first round
[4/5/18, 11:53:17 AM] Brian Katz: Green Bay
[4/5/18, 11:53:55 AM] Brian Katz: Pats maybe
[4/5/18, 11:54:14 AM] Miller: pats shouldnt bother
[4/5/18, 11:54:24 AM] Miller: worst track record of drafting WRs in NFL history
[4/5/18, 11:55:11 AM] Brian Katz: Not that great at drafting in general
[4/5/18, 11:56:23 AM] Miller: some hits and misses
[4/5/18, 11:56:28 AM] Brian Katz: They should probably get a te in the draft somewhere too. Go back to that gronk Hernandez offense they used to rock
[4/5/18, 11:56:37 AM] Miller: they trade their picks more than any other team i would guess
[4/5/18, 1:01:21 PM] Miller: pretty lame the cheese of my office never paid me my $20 for the NCAA pool
[4/5/18, 1:01:58 PM] Miller: i asked him 2x and he was like yea yea and then nothing, its awkward b/c its a coworker (and not one i really know) and its $20 so not gonna change my life so i think im just eating it
[4/5/18, 1:03:05 PM] Fberg: $20 lesson to learn not to invite him into ncaa pool next year
[4/5/18, 1:03:32 PM] Miller: a loss aint a loss its a lesson
[4/5/18, 1:05:00 PM] Fberg: exactly
[4/5/18, 1:05:25 PM] Launchpad: spoken like a true loser
[4/5/18, 1:05:56 PM] Miller: i would love to be losing like jayz is
[4/5/18, 1:06:17 PM] Launchpad: lol its a good quote but the opportunity to roast you was too great
[4/5/18, 1:06:23 PM] Launchpad: like me telling cheese to kill himself
[4/5/18, 2:54:26 PM] Scott: and then coincidentally and karmatically you getting laid off.
[4/5/18, 3:04:28 PM] Miller: Cheese who gets mad about any joke even tangentially involving his ex wife who he divorced a year ago coming in hot with the unemployment jokes 24 hours later
[4/5/18, 3:07:42 PM] Scott: he told me to kill myself unprompted, only reason why i would throw anything back liket hat
[4/5/18, 3:07:43 PM] Scott: that
[4/5/18, 3:13:41 PM] Fberg: https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/981968051737260032
[4/5/18, 3:13:56 PM] Launchpad: thats not true you asked us what we think you should do
[4/5/18, 3:14:31 PM] Scott: fair, with prompt, still unnecessary
[4/5/18, 3:40:37 PM] Scott: So connor McGregor has had a crazy day
[4/5/18, 7:11:47 PM] Miller: I think my favorite jersey shore moment was when Deena met this Ronnie doppelganger and she brings him back to the house and the guys go to wake up Ronnie because it's hilarious and Ronnie half wakes up and goes is that Dean?
[4/6/18, 2:11:34 PM] Launchpad: in other news, me losing my job is basically Trumps fault
